["<cs> my lords i hope this answer is more comprehensible to the noble lord than the previous one <e> <s> it was decided in geneva to include in a revised negotiating text a number of provisions on certain key subjects which enjoyed broad support thus bringing a convention nearer <e> <s> but on deep seabed mining and some other topics important questions remain to be satisfactorily resolved <e>

the deep seabed rgime and the mining that will take place there <e> <s> the noble lord raised first the financing of the mining operations <e> <s> this matter really has yet to be resolved satisfactorily but i hope that progress will be made at the resumed conference in july and august <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are following the progress of legislation in the united states on this matter but as the noble lord will know the legislation has some way to go in the american congress <e> <s> i think that there are two measures going through one in the senate and one in the house of representatives neither of which has made much progress so far <e> <s> we are certainly watching the position closely but we have not yet reached any decision ourselves as to what we would do in similar circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of the suggestions about the position of the united states government in this matter <e> <s> i do not think that i can do more than repeat the position as i understand it namely that any activities of this nature would in the united states require legislation just as they do here and so far the legislation has not passed the american congress <e>", "<cs> my lords we are in active consultation with the governments of other co-signatory states with the aim of promoting progress in all aspects of implementation of the helsinki final act <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly look into the case which the noble lord raises if he will give me details afterwards it is not one about which i have details at the moment <e>", "<cs> no doubt they are not indifferent to it my lords but as i have said before it is sometimes counter-productive and we prefer to use the other course <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i think we accept that but as i said we prefer to take the line of careful consideration behind the scenes <e> <s> we do not rule out public declarations in appropriate cases but in general we prefer the more cautious line <e>", "<cs> i do not suppose they will comply with all their obligations overnight my lords <e> <s> we never thought they would but some progress has been made notably as i have mentioned in the number of exit visas granted to jewish citizens in the ussr which as i have said have nearly doubled in the last months <e>", "<cs> my lords i gladly give the assurance which the noble lord seeks <e> <s> in fact the bilateral discussions he mentions are already in progress <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords the discussions include the nine <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not say that that was the major provision of the helsinki agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords the government will maintain and indeed strengthen the united kingdoms support for international co-operation against terrorism including hijacking <e> <s> this cooperation which covers both legal and practical measures is continuing in the european community the council of europe the united nations the international civil aviation organisation and other international groupings as well as bilaterally <e>", "<cs> my lords the plo is essentially a political organisation <e> <s> most of the terrorist acts that come to our notice are committed by organisations which are certainly affiliated to the plo <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that i did not read that report in the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will probably recall that the bonn declaration produced a statement to that effect <e> <s> as for iata i think that the most effective aviation forum for these matters is the international civil aviation organisation which i consider is dealing with the position rather effectively <e> <s> on th october it passed a resolution which has yet to be ratified by all the members but we hope that it will be in due course <e> <s> with regard to the position in the united kingdom my right honourable friends the secretary of state for trade and the home secretary have the necessary powers to take any measure <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that it is sometimes rather difficult to draw distinctions but i should say that the plo has very often disclaimed responsibility and indeed has condemned a number of the terrorist acts which have taken place <e>", "<cs> my lords that is rather a long supplementary question <e> <s> i think i can answer it though in just a few words <e> <s> we continue unreservedly to condemn all terrorist acts whoever commits them whether it be the plo affiliates to the plo or some other body <e> <s> the plo office in london continues to comply with the law and while it does so we cannot do anything about it nor should we <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of our diplomatic representation in guinea has been under review and the government will give the matter further consideration later this year <e> <s> we welcome the positive trend in our bilateral relations and are pleased to note the increased interest in guinea being shown by our businessmen <e>", "<cs> my lords we are aware that there are increasing prospects for our businessmen in guinea <e> <s> there are difficulties however first of all in the face of opening a new mission in guinea <e> <s> as i think the noble lord knows our affairs there are presently looked after by the ambassador in dakar <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government support the decision of the economic commission for europe that a high level meeting on the environment should take place in november and look forward to playing a constructive part in it <e>", "<cs> my lords the eec will be represented at the conference together with the united kingdom scandinavian countries certain east european countries and the soviet union <e> <s> our delegation will probably be led by a junior minister <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord trenchard i beg to introduce a bill to amend the law relating to companies <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord carrington much regrets that because the previous debate went on longer than anticipated and because of an inescapable engagement he is not able to open this debate himself this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the manner in which this bill has been discussed in your lordships house tonight <e> <s> i hardly need say that the passage of this bill through the previous and present parliaments has aroused more than the usual public and parliamentary attention attracted by an independence bill <e> <s> much of this attention has been controversial arising from the difficult banaban issue <e> <s> it is a great tribute to our british system that the voice of a tiny community at the other end of the world is heard so strongly <e> <s> as i have already said the government considered the matter very carefully before deciding that it was only right that this bill should be reintroduced to enable the gilbert islands to proceed to their promised independence and i emphasise promised independence on th july on the basis of the agreement reached at the constitutional conference last december <e>", "<cs> my lords i should need to take advice as to whether interest is payable on the million <e>", "<cs> my lords that confirms in my mind the view that this must be a matter for consideration after independence <e> <s> i do not think that it is really considered that the banabans on their ocean island should conduct a separate independent foreign policy <e> <s> is it proposed that they should send representatives to the united nations <e> <s> i do not think that that is a sensible proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord is mistaken <e> <s> my information is that the proposals were that the banabans should retain responsibility for foreign affairs <e> <s> be that as it may nobody has suggested and certainly the government do not accept that this should form the basis of some separate state to be agreed before the kiribati state proceeds to independence <e> <s> the noble lord lord brockway asked <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord carrington i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> is the noble marquess aware that the bill went through parliament or at least through this house last session without amendment at all <e>", "<cs> why should parliament have changed its view in just a few short weeks <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to intervene in the internal discussions of the party opposite but it might be to the benefit of your lordships if at this point <e>", "<cs> i can confirm that interest will be paid on the sum up to the end of <e> <s> i think that the figure is just about the amount the noble lord mentioned <e> <s> the banabans were informed by the previous government no doubt by the noble lord himself that interest would be limited up to that date <e> <s> the present government have confirmed that that is the position <e> <s> it is not proposed at present although we have not closed the door to further discussions that interest should be paid beyond the end of <e>", "<cs> that may be so but there was a narrow division on the bill last week and the matter was certainly contested fiercely resulting in a narrow result when the same bill was considered in the previous session <e>", "<cs> if the banabans have accepted the sovereignty of the gilbertese then that is all the more reason why the bill should go through now in the form in which it is before your lordships <e> <s> the noble marquess lord aberdeen also asked me why i was he thought so against amendments to this bill in principle <e> <s> i am not against amendments in principle i am just against this amendment <e> <s> we are not persuaded that this bill would be improved by the agreement of this amendment <e> <s> i hope therefore that the noble lord lord brockway will not press it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords the united nations economic commission for latin america at its meeting in la paz at the end of april passed a number of resolutions of which the most important concerned the international development strategy protectionism and industrial restructuring <e> <s> these resolutions embodied the aims of the latin american members for the subsequent unctad v session in manila <e> <s> the non-regional members placed reservations on paragraphs that they could not support <e> <s> their role is necessarily limited but the british delegation did what it could to play a positive part <e>", "<cs> my lords we already do what we can in the way of aid for countries in this region but the noble lord will realise that we live in hard and difficult times and it is not always possible to do as much as we would like <e>", "<cs> my lords yes indeed we have <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that it will be for the convenience of your lordships if i intervene now to answer the private notice question put earlier by the noble baroness lady stedman by repeating a statement made by my honourable friend the under-secretary of state for trade in the other place <e> <s> my lords the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged for the remarks of both the noble baroness and the noble earl and i shall deal first with the points made by the noble baroness <e> <s> she asked whether we had any comment on the decision by the japanese authorities not for the moment to allow dcs to land in japan <e> <s> the answer to that is i think that we cannot make any comment on action taken by the japanese government which must of course remain a matter for them <e> <s> as for spain we have no information yet as to whether the spaniards have decided to allow their dcs to fly once more but we are of course monitoring the position <e> <s> in regard to landings in the united states that matter is not yet clear <e> <s> it is certainly not yet the case that the american government have said that our dcs cannot land although they have prohibited their own aircraft from operating <e>", "<cs> my lords i readily say that the government are absolutely satisfied that the civil aviation authority have very properly discharged their duties in this matter which of course include consulting the airworthiness requirements board <e> <s> the civil aviation authority are therefore satisfied that the dcs on the british register are entirely fit to fly <e> <s> as for the point about the bermuda ii agreement which the noble lord raised the position is that the certification of aircraft as such is not covered by the bermuda agreement although the americans undertake under i think article of that agreement to recognise certificates of airworthiness issued by the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said the civil aviation authority have a duty to satisfy themselves that all aircraft offered for united kingdom certificates of airworthiness are indeed so eligible and they have certainly satisfied themselves in this case including of course making detailed inquiries into all the points that have been brought to their attention <e> <s> on the question of the automatic certification of foreign aircraft which i think is the point the noble earl made certainly the civil aviation authority do not automatically certify foreign aircraft offered for united kingdom certificates even if the aircraft already hold certificates of the country of manufacture <e>", "<cs> my lords as your lordships know this is an issue which the previous government were unable to resolve <e> <s> my right honourable friend the lord privy seal stated in another place on th june that the government are considering the matter and that a statement will be made as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly draw those words to my right honourable friends attention <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise armed with a sheaf of papers informed to answer almost every point that has been made in this debate but we will see how we go and if i get a bit long-winded perhaps noble lords will forgive me if i cut my remarks short and answer the rest of the points in correspondence <e> <s> as my noble friend lord trenchard has already covered most of the foreign shipping relations matters that have been raised i will concentrate my attention more narrowly on the united kingdom industry and some of its specific and more domestic problems <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot hide from your lordships the fact that we are disappointed by the present eec position on this matter <e> <s> we are certainly pressing them now as opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords the government will continue to work for balanced and verifiable measures of disarmament <e> <s> we shall play a constructive part in the work of the committee on disarmament in geneva <e>", "<cs> my lords the document to which i think the noble lord refers is a full and comprehensive one which is being closely studied by the new ministers and therefore i do not think i can add much to what i said originally but the government certainly share the view of all other members of the united nations that this must be the ultimate goal of arms control efforts <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot say whether that will be done <e> <s> it certainly has not been done yet <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether a minister will be designated as a minister for disarmament as such <e> <s> there may be some difficulties about that <e> <s> however i have no doubt that my right honourable friends will be attending in geneva from time to time <e>", "<cs> my lords not at question time <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> we are indeed indebted to the noble lord lord buxton of alsa for raising once more the question of oil pollution of the sea by ships which is undoubtedly a matter of continuing public interest and concern <e> <s> we have all been sickened have we not by the pathetic sight of seabirds so smothered by oil as to he barely recognisable as once living creatures we have all seen photographs of the beaches of brittany as they were last year covered by a thick carpet of oil and many of us or our children have come across the tar and the like to our cost on our own beaches <e>", "<cs> my lords the level of overseas aid for future years will be decided by ministers in the course of their normal review of public expenditure for and beyond <e> <s> this review will be undertaken against the back-ground of the overriding need to reduce the excessive level of public expenditure <e> <s> we cannot yet say anything about the effect of this review on any particular programme <e>", "<cs> my lords the reduction in aid announced for this year <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we will of course have regard to our commitments to foreign countries and also to the targets set by the united nations <e>", "<cs> not without notice my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i cannot answer for the government of the united states of america <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that no field of overseas aid is exempt from the governments present review <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not reducing our aid next year <e> <s> despite the cut there is a real and a relative increase <e>", "<cs> no my lords we are reviewing our aid to all countries and i am afraid none of them is exempt from our considerations <e>", "<cs> my lords many things may prove to be a blow to british industry but the fact remains that we cannot give aid that we do not already have to give <e>", "<cs> my lords every noble lord has said quite rightly how grateful we are to the noble lord lord parry for introducing this important not to say vital matter this afternoon <e> <s> i should like in the course of my own remarks to refer to some of the points raised <e> <s> before doing so i must congratulate the noble lord on his recent appointment to the chair of the wales tourist board to which he referred and also thank him for his kind references to me at the beginning of his remarks <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord was very wise my lords <e> <s> the appointment of a minister for tourism has also been suggested <e> <s> that is a matter for the prime minister but at present ministerial responsibility for tourism rests with my right honourable friend the secretary of state for trade who ensures that the subject gets the necessary hearing in cabinet as the need arises <e> <s> he is assisted of course by my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary who has special responsibilities for tourism <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be helpful if i start by giving a brief resum of the history of this matter as we know it and then deal with the facts pertinent to the current operation of dc-s across the north atlantic <e> <s> i do not wish to discuss in any detail the tragic accident of th may which occurred to a domestic service operated out of chicagos ohare airport by a united states scheduled airline <e> <s> the loss of life meant that this was the worst ever aircraft accident on united states soil and it led to an immediate grounding of dc-s by the united states federal aviation <e>", "<cs> my lords the government who attach importance to friendly relations with spain keep in close touch with the spanish government on matters of mutual interest <e> <s> but there is no formalised dialogue <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer for the previous administration <e> <s> i am not in a position to say what particular priority it attached to these conversations but we certainly think that continued relations with the spanish government are of great importance <e>", "<cs> yes of course my lords we attach great importance to both those matters <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord kimberley has whetted our appetites on many occasions over recent months in connection with the aerospace industry and i join with previous speakers in thanking the noble earl for providing us again with an opportunity to air the subject if i may use that term <e> <s> when i first read the question i recalled our debate on th march initiated again by the noble earl <e> <s> to he fair that debate concentrated on the smaller size range of aircraft and the market for aircraft from around seats up to perhaps <e>", "<cs> my lords i have read the press reports on those proposals as the noble earl has done <e> <s> i have no formal information on that to hand but i will look into the matter further and will write to the noble earl <e>", "<cs> that is certainly true my lords but i think carriage in the aircraft is also a problem which has not yet fully been solved <e> <s> i certainly agree that the problem to which the noble lord refers is another which has not yet been solved <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it would be convenient if i were to write to the noble lord on that point <e> <s> i could give him some information if i were to take that course <e>", "<cs> my lords we are actively considering the level of our relations with argentina <e> <s> our decision will be announced in due course <e>", "<cs> i think my noble friend is quite right my lords and that is why we are actively reconsidering our policy in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble lord for that helpful observation <e> <s> i think we are actually continuing the policy of the previous administration in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we already have diplomatic representation at a lower level in buenos aires but the appointment of an ambassador is an important matter and not to be rushed <e>", "<cs> my lords our approval or disapproval of human rights considerations in various countries of the <e>", "<cs> that is certainly a special consideration my lords but it is perhaps relevant and right for me to point out that the argentine government last year issued a decree calling on all religious organisations to register <e> <s> organisations which are considered a threat to public order national security or argentine morals or traditions may be refused registration and thus denied permission to practise <e> <s> we are not very happy with that decision <e>", "<cs> my lords the merchant shipping act is largely an enabling measure <e> <s> i envisage that we shall make the first orders or regulations under this act well before the end of this year and that we shall continue to use these powers for many years to come <e> <s> all these orders and regulations will be published as statutory instruments <e>", "<cs> my lords the merchant shipping act was not passed by parliament until the closing days of the last administration <e> <s> it was hastened through on i think the very day that parliament was dissolved as noble lords will recall <e> <s> however the new disciplinary arrangements were brought into operation on a voluntary basis from the beginning of this year under the aegis of the national maritime board <e> <s> it will

urgently under the united nations <e> <s> the united nations secretary-general has now decided to convene such a conference in geneva on th and st july <e>", "<cs> the noble lord raised a number of points there my lords <e> <s> certainly the countries to which he referred will be invited to the conference which is to take place in geneva later this month although i cannot yet say whether or not they will accept the invitation <e> <s> recourse to the security council cannot be ruled out at some stage <e> <s> i recall that on the last two occasions in january and march when the security council debated events in indo china the soviet union exercised its veto <e>", "<cs> my lords we cannot force them to come to geneva if they do not want to <e>", "<cs> we agree my lords that all the relevant countries <e>", "<cs> it is certainly our view my lords that the conference in geneva is a desirable precursor to any meeting of the security council <e>", "<cs> my lords if the security council met and any effective resolution was immediately vetoed by the russians i do not think anything very concrete would have been achieved <e> <s> as for the conference in geneva we hope that all the important countries will be there but we cannot force them to be there and i have no doubt that the world community in general will draw their own conclusions if they do not go <e>", "<cs> my lords i have expressed our view that it is desirable for these nations to be present at the conference and i repeat that now but i am not sure how we insist upon it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i could not link the ratification of the salt ii treaty with this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the suggestions of the noble lord will always be closely considered by any government and i will certainly see that his latest one is brought to the attention of my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords lord shackletons economic survey of the falkland islands was published in <e> <s> since then this house has been informed from time to time of progress made in implementing the many recommendations it contained <e> <s> some were quite specific others more general <e> <s> all have been carefully examined <e> <s> a majority of the recommendations have now been implemented <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is mistaken a majority of the recommendations have been implemented <e>", "<cs> my lords we totally reject the suggestion that my right honourable friend the lord privy seal in any way misled the other place <e> <s> he said and i confirm that a majority of the recommendations have now been implemented <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i certainly agree that the best way for the falkland islands would be with the agreement of and in consultation with the argentine government but i confirm that this has to be done with the agreement of the falkland islanders themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i actually undertook to make any detailed statement but i am quite prepared to do so <e> <s> if it meets the convenience of your lordships i will arrange for the list of lord shackletons recommendations and the action that has been taken on them to be circulated in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose there is some room for variation in interpretation of what constitutes a recommendation but we certainly maintain that quantitatively a majority of the recommendations have been implemented <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord referred to the basic rejection at the unctad conference of some matter which i did not quite hear <e>", "<cs> my lords we are doubly fortunate tonight first to hear the unstarred question put so eloquently by the noble lord lord brockway and secondly to hear the first intervention of the noble lord lord hatch of lusby from the dispatch box opposite <e> <s> not often do we get a double bill of that stature <e>", "<cs> my lords i think there is a confusion in the mind of the noble lord because there are two separate organisations which have been brought to my attention <e> <s> if the noble lord will allow me i will write to him with a clear exposition of that point <e>", "<cs> my lords we have certainly made no promises as to what we will do for the future <e> <s> that is correct <e> <s> we shall have to consider what we can do for the future in the light of the circumstances in which we then find ourselves

total sums of money involved something more than million still for this year which by any standards i should have thought was a vast sum of money <e>", "<cs> my lords this review is in hand <e> <s> the government are consulting the association of british chambers of commerce and will then consult other interested bodies <e> <s> we shall announce our conclusions as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly do not agree that the boycott is in any way acceptable or satisfactory but authentication relates only to signatures and seals on documents and not to the contents of the documents themselves <e> <s> it in no way implies that the contents of the documents are condoned <e>", "<cs> my lords i have looked at the report and the fact remains that the authentication of the signatures relates only to that fact that is to the authentication of the signatures themselves <e> <s> we never condone the content of the documents <e>", "<cs> my lords i am simply reporting the facts of the matter <e> <s> i agree that the committee said that some people were perhaps misled into thinking that the government by authenticating the signatures condoned the <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said to the noble lord lord byers it is certainly the case on occasions that the impression gets abroad that we are condoning the content of the documents but i say again that that is certainly not the case <e> <s> but a change in the practice whereby the foreign office officials authenticate these signatures on documents of all types without discrimination involves a difficult point of principle and a grave risk to our exports <e>", "<cs> my lords i can undertake to keep the house informed on our consideration of this matter but i cannot give any assurance that that will be in the very near future <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is difficult to include necessarily all the eec governments in these consultations but i can say that i think all the eec governments without exception follow the same practice as we follow <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly have another look at the wording but i do not think off hand that it is possible to do much about it <e>", "<cs> no my lords the motion has been put <e>", "<cs> my lords as is so often the case when speaking from this box it is my duty privilege and pleasure to be doubly grateful to members sitting on the other side of the house <e> <s> i am doubly grateful tonight to the noble baroness lady seear first for raising this matter which is most important and interesting and secondly for

speak often and soon in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords there are goods having a general industrial application which could also be used as components in a nuclear facility <e> <s> such

year that might have been used for the enrichment facility which they have we understand established but i have no information on any other goods supplied <e> <s> certainly the matter referred to by the noble lord sounds to me to be speculation <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that we ought to obey all the rules and we certainly honour all our obligations under the non-proliferation treaty <e> <s> we did not supply centrifugal enrichment equipment to the pakistanis <e> <s> we did supply some frequency changers otherwise known as inverters but that is not the same as the equipment itself

facility that is to say it does not fall under the control of the international atomic energy authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to both noble lords <e> <s> perhaps in winding up i could respond to the first point made by the noble lord lord shepherd when he said that he would have preferred that we should proceed by using the procedure under section of the act <e> <s> one of the important differences of the procedure under that subsection of course is that there is a referendum in the islands upon the issue of independence and that is not the case if we follow as we have decided to do the procedure in the order before your lordships today <e> <s> the referendum procedure is in the west indies act for use if an associated state desires to move to independence unilaterally against the wishes of the british government <e> <s> so <e>", "<cs> my lords the government were aware of the conference but have so far seen only press reports of the proceedings <e> <s> i shall make further inquiries about the speech referred to by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i cannot comment on the proceedings of the conference until i have seen the report <e>",

another place <e> <s> they are available in the library of this house and these arrangements will continue until the next csce <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter for parliament rather than for the government <e> <s> however as the noble lord will be aware consideration is being given in the other place to setting up a committee to monitor foreign affairs <e> <s> i have no doubt that if that suggestion is proceeded with that committee will concern itself particularly with matters of this nature <e> <s> there is also the helsinki review committee of which the noble lord lord caccia is such a distinguished member and the government will continue to provide information to that committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the committee referred to by the noble lord is the helsinki review

"<cs> my lords we certainly attach great importance to all the requirements of the helsinki agreement and we will continue to monitor it on a worldwide scale as we have already done <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think parliament would quite agree with that <e>", "<cs> my lords the matter of suitable equipment for use at united kingdom aerodromes to promote regularity and safety of operations

limits of our resources <e>", "<cs> my lords i think both those points are very true <e> <s> we shall certainly bear them very much in mind when deciding our priorities <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly hope that our aid does not go to the lite only as the noble lord suggests and we will certainly bear the other points very much in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that is necessarily the case <e> <s> the noble lord is generating certain fears in my mind with that expression i must say but i think he has a point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to both noble lords for

that we take proper steps to see that the money we provide is used for the purposes for which it is intended <e>", "<cs> my lords we have permanent representation in all countries of this nature through our high commissioners <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to try to be helpful on this point and i wonder whether the noble baroness can answer a question one hour from when to when <e> <s> can she be specific <e>", "<cs> can the noble baroness be specific as to when the one hour applied <e> <s> was it from aircraft touchdown or from aircraft on stand or perhaps from when the doors were opened <e>", "<cs> one hour from when <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall need the divine protection that was afforded to daniel in the den tonight if i am to get away with my skin but i will do my best <e> <s> i think we all recognise the importance of the subject which the noble lord has raised this evening <e> <s> with his great experience of aviation matters both within government and as the first chairman of the civil aviation authority he will know that the handling of baggage at heathrow is not primarily the responsibility of the government but is a matter for the day-to-day management first of the airlines but also of the british airports authority <e> <s> nevertheless he has constructed his question in such way as to enable the house to have this useful short debate on it and i congratulate him upon doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that the tube is not the best form of transport for anyone with a large quantity of baggage <e> <s> but all the same as i have said baggage trolleys can be taken right to the barrier of the tube and it is then just a very short walk on to the train itself <e> <s> we must however recognise <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i agree that there is a problem for passengers with baggage on the tube <e> <s> the tube is certainly not the best method of travel for those who are elderly or infirm or who have a large quantity of baggage <e> <s> but i shall come to the question of buses in a moment <e> <s> passengers for central london who are elderly or infirm or who have more baggage than they can carry on the tube are expected to use the british airways bus service to the victoria terminal and i understand that they would be advised to that effect by the porters <e> <s> i think the noble lord lord douglas would confirm that <e> <s> however i shall come back to the buses in a little more detail <e>", "<cs> my lords no one is a greater admirer of sir peter masefield than i however i should have thought that the motivation for airlines particularly in this matter to achieve an improvement in their performance must be quite powerful <e> <s> i doubt whether any other body however expert and famous is likely to provide any suggestions which are any more likely to achieve success than those which are <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord salisbury for having given the house a valuable opportunity to consider this matter particularly because it gives me an opportunity to emphasise what my right honourable friend the prime minister said to the other place earlier this week <e> <s> the importance of the matter cannot be over-emphasised because it is clear if there were any doubt that all noble lords will agree that the safety of her majesty whether at home or abroad is of paramount concern to us all <e>", "<cs> my lords there can be no question of our giving any new aid to vietnam while the vietnamese government continue their callous and inhuman policy which is the root cause of the present indo-chinese refugee problem <e> <s> current british aid commitments carried over from the previous government are to meet by agreed instalments the remaining million of the total grant to support the sale of four british-built cargo vessels to vietnam and to complete the courses of english language training in britain for the few vietnamese teachers who are due to remain here until june <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure i would use the language my noble friend used in referring to the people of vietnam but certainly the situation there is highly unsatisfactory <e> <s> my noble friend will have read however of the fairly satisfactory outcome of the conference at geneva at the end of last week <e> <s> on the question of ships aid as the house knows in opposition we were highly critical of the ships aid <e> <s> on taking office we looked promptly to see whether we could stop it but as my right honourable friend the prime minister said in another place unfortunately it would cost us more to cancel those contracts than to complete them <e> <s> furthermore the commitment was a firm one and cancellation would have had damaging effects on british shipbuilders and its employees <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that is in my noble friends mind <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we will do that i think but we shall want to see the outcome and the effect of the undertakings given by the vietnamese before we move further <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and we felt deep unease about it as well and that is why we reviewed the whole matter when we came to office <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not able to bind my noble friend the foreign secretary to make a statement today tomorrow or any other day but i know that is very much in his mind <e>", "<cs> my lords that was certainly one of the things we considered at the outset when we came to office but it proved to be impracticable however desirable it might seem <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it impossible to justify the action of the vietnamese government even bearing in mind the factors mentioned by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i will do that my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords a request has been received from the tanzanian government for special economic assistance and will require co-ordinated consideration by the international community <e> <s> our own response must to some extent depend upon the outcome of the public expenditure review <e>", "<cs> my lords what the noble lord says may well be true but development aid cannot be used directly or indirectly for military purposes <e> <s> we can help tanzania with general economic aid and this we are doing and shall continue to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i must repeat that we do not provide development aid for military purposes either directly or indirectly <e> <s> but having said that the application that has been made by the tanzanian government both to ourselves and as the noble lord mentioned a group of other governments has not fallen on stony ground and we shall certainly seek to help as best we can within the limits of our resources <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft weights and measures solid fuel carriage by rail amendment order laid before the house on th july be approved <e> <s> i hope it will not be necessary to detain you very long over this order <e> <s> its purpose is to make some necessary amendments to legal requirements affecting the carriage of solid fuel by rail which have remained unchanged since <e> <s> the order is concerned only with the whole train loads of fuel which are being carried by rail to a single industrial undertaking it does not therefore affect coal intended for domestic consumption or where the train is to be broken up to make deliveries <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not for the first time very much in the debt of the noble lord lord northfield for giving us the chance to discuss this important matter tonight <e> <s> but before embarking on what i hope will be a full and helpful reply may i mention two necessary pre-conditions to an effective and lasting low-fares policy <e> <s> first there must be an economic return to efficient operators <e> <s> it is no service to the consumer for an airline to offer very low fares and then find itself in difficulty and having either to increase its fares substantially or go out of business <e> <s> secondly there must be no cutting back of standards of safety <e> <s> british airlines enjoy a high reputation for safety and this must be maintained <e> <s> subject to these conditions the government are anxious of course to see fares as low as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house as my noble friend the foreign secretary is in brussels today i shall reply to the question asked by the noble lord lord brockway <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to both noble lords for what they have said <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord avebury somewhat oversimplifies the problems in accepting a large number of refugees in this country from the far east or from anywhere else <e> <s> we have offered as the noble lord will know and as my noble friend confirmed in geneva to accept additional refugees and the process of accepting those is now going ahead <e> <s> the noble lord lord brockway referred to the special position of hong kong in this matter <e> <s> hong kong will certainly benefit from the geneva conference in two ways the reduction in outflow from vietnam and from the speedier resettlement of no fewer than refugees who now find themselves there <e> <s> as the governor emphasised in his speech there is a clear need for hong kong to be given more resettlement places <e> <s> this has been fully recognised by the united nations high commissioner for refugees and others concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords the re-uniting of divided families was one of the earliest matters to which the vietnamese government agreed with the united nations high commissioner for refugees i think it was as far back as may <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts for the helpful things that he said <e> <s> he asked about curing the disease as well as the symptoms <e> <s> i think the conference was very effective in treating the symptoms of the disease but with regard to the disease itself the united nations secretary-general was authorised by the vietnamese government in his final speech to make certain undertakings the effect of which if carried through as we hope they will be will be effectively to control and restrict the outflow of refugees from vietnam <e> <s> it was a solemn and formal undertaking given to the united nations secretary-general and we hope they will honour it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that that is entirely fair <e> <s> there was of course a long and tragic war in which america certainly took part in the latter stages but the war had been going on for many many years before the americans even became involved <e> <s> despite that however the americans have accepted according to my figures refugees <e>", "<cs> my lords the helsinki agreement related to affairs in europe and not the far east <e>", "<cs> my lords once again the house has been treated to a careful thoughtful and helpful speech from my noble friend lord selsdon and indeed from my noble friend lord morris <e> <s> may i say that from the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts we have had a useful introduction to this difficult subject <e> <s> my noble friends question hangs on the precise relationship of gibraltar to the eec <e> <s> let me begin by reminding noble lords of the formal status which we secured for gibraltar i might add after lengthy negotiation in the accession negotiations between and <e>", "<cs> my lords i really do not think i can go much further than i have done <e> <s> we do not link the question of spanish accession to the eec with that of the lifting of restrictions across the border between spain and gibraltar <e> <s> as my right honourable friend said it is inconceivable that these restrictions could remain <e> <s> if spain were to join the eec we think the spaniards will see the merits of that argument and we hope that restrictions will be lifted long before spain has joined the common market <e>", "<cs> my lords there are no published details of comecon countries trade loans or of total indebtedness to the united kingdom or the oecd countries <e> <s> at the end of the bank of international settlement reported comecon liabilities to western commercial banks totalling about billion dollars of which about a quarter is owed to banks in the united kingdom <e> <s> the comecon countries have maintained a sound payments record <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may answer the last supplementary first i think we have to trade in the real world <e> <s> we certainly keep a close eye on what we export to the soviet union so that we do not unwittingly provide them with technology which we would rather they did not have <e> <s> with regard to my noble friends point on cheap interest rates we have certainly vigorously supported international attempts to rationalise credit <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly scrutinise applications with the same diligence as the previous administration but we do not always apply the same criteria <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not aware that there will have to be a rescheduling <e> <s> as i said before the comecon countries have thus far at least maintained a sound payments record <e>", "<cs> my lords yes you can <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that your lordships will appreciate as much as i do the unstarred question of the noble earl lord grey which gives me an opportunity to explain the governments attitude to the recent visit to london by the national indian brotherhood of canada <e> <s> it is true that during the visit the delegation was not received by any minister <e> <s> on the other hand although we had known for some weeks that the brotherhood was planning to send a delegation to london and subsequently heard that they were hoping while here to meet my right honourable friend the prime minister and my noble friend the foreign and commonwealth secretary the government received no approach from the brotherhood or anyone representing them requesting such a meeting until very shortly before their arrival in this country on st july <e>", "<cs> my lords just before i sit down perhaps i may confirm one rather important point which the noble lord mentioned <e> <s> certainly the act transferred to the government of canada with their sovereign i should say all the principal effects of government in canada including most importantly the administration of the treaties to which the noble earl referred <e> <s> that was the british north america act <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to the noble lord for allowing me to intervene <e> <s> i wonder whether he can clarify that point about american planes <e> <s> he said that they had been deployed in cyprus but for what purpose <e> <s> i did not quite hear <e>", "<cs> my lords lord newalls interest in this matter is well known and much to be admired <e> <s> his recent visit to cyprus clearly gave him an opportunity to gain first-hand knowledge on this important subject <e> <s> i am very pleased to have a chance of putting the governments view before your lordships tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier in my speech there is no question at this stage of recognising the government of the northern part of the island as an independent entity and while that situation continues there will be difficulties still in the way of promoting trade <e> <s> however this is certainly a matter we are keeping very much in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i have nothing to add to the reply i gave to the noble lord on th june <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that our trade prospects with guinea are necessarily governed by whether or not we have an embassy there <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said our trade prospects with guinea are not necessarily dependent upon whether or not we have a mission there <e> <s> we have a consul in conakry who does a great deal of work of a commercial nature which is very valuable but also there is the question of the commercial implications of our trade <e> <s> i should say that guineas record of payments is not as good as it should be <e> <s> ecgd cover at present has to be restricted to short-term business because guinea has failed to meet her obligations under the terms of the debt re-scheduling agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not true to say that the consul cannot speak english <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned this before and i have taken the trouble to check it <e> <s> he speaks perfectly adequate english <e> <s> it is true as the noble lord has said that the guineans have indicated a willingness to discuss the question of the debt <e> <s> if they are a wealthy country as the noble lord has said why could they not pay the debt <e> <s> it is only a small sum <e>", "<cs> my lords we have already done so <e> <s> a review of the work of the committee can be found in the first issue of the governments arms control and disarmament newsletter and in the speech made by my honourable friend the minister of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs to the first committee of the united nations on <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord that the proceedings of this committee ought to be more widely disseminated but i do not think there is anything more we can do than we have done already <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may take up the point made by the noble lord concerning chemical weapons the committee on disarmament has not yet been able to start negotiating a treaty text because of the need to avoid impeding the bilateral us and ussr talks <e> <s> while we acknowledge the pressure for the committee to start multilateral negotiations on chemical weapons we believe such negotiations will be useful only if both the united states and the soviet union are in broad agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords two points again i shall have to take advice on the precise diplomatic status of our representative in geneva and i will write to the noble lord if i may <e> <s> on the question of whether we should proceed with negotiations for a multilateral treaty on for example chemical weapons while bilateral talks between the us and the ussr are in progress that is a matter of judgment i think and our judgment is certainly that these bilateral talks would be impeded if we were to proceed on a multilateral basis at this time <e>", "<cs> my lords the present government were not consulted about the agreement and are not parties to it <e> <s> not being parties to the agreement the government cannot be bound by it <e> <s> the government will reach their view on this and other matters concerning expansion of londons airports when they receive shortly the reports of the advisory committee on airports policy and the study group on south-east airports <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in some difficulty in replying to that supplementary because of the quasi-judicial functions of my right honourable friends the secretaries of state for the environment and for trade in relation to the forthcoming inquiry into a second terminal at gatwick <e> <s> i think it would be inappropriate for me at this stage to express a view such as that for which the noble lord asks <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i can go further than my original answer and perhaps i might quote just one sentence from it <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have not yet reached their conclusion in this matter <e> <s> as i said in my original answer we are awaiting the reports of the advisory committee on airports policy and of the study group on south-east airports <e> <s> until those reports are received we have an open mind on these matters and certainly we have reached no conclusion as to whether or not there should be a second runway at gatwick <e> <s> when our predecessors were in office they announced in the white paper that they saw if my memory serves me aright no future in the proposal for a second runway at gatwick <e> <s> we reserved our position on that white paper when we were in opposition and are not yet in a position to announce our conclusions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that the cargo village recently constructed at gatwick is along the line of one of the possible sites for a second runway <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in fact certain that the british airports authority and the west sussex county council are well aware of the thoughts contained in my answer today <e>", "<cs> my lords the position is not entirely one for the local authority <e> <s> there are other people concerned including the government and the british airports authority <e>", "<cs> my lords the final conclusion in this matter must rest with the government and we have not yet made our decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to extend the insurance <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are very much aware of the dangers presented to the scottish coasts and to marine life by the increased tanker traffic to the north and west of scotland <e> <s> for this reason a group under department of trade chairmanship and including representatives of the scottish office and local authorities has been examining this problem <e> <s> as a result the department has undertaken to develop for approval by imco a traffic separation scheme for the minches <e> <s> consideration is also being given to whether it would <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i think that was implied in the original answer <e> <s> however the mandatory exclusion of tankers would not be consistent with the right of ships to innocent passage through our waters and we are obliged to comply with the terms of the international convention on the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that question is pretty wide of that of traffic going through the minches <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we hope that all those countries who have not so far adhered to these conventions will do so as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble viscount is right <e> <s> the department of trades contingency arrangements for dealing with oil spills at sea however extend to the whole of the united kingdom coastline <e> <s> however in view of the obvious difficulties in mounting a counter-pollution exercise off the north-west coast of scotland the department recently carried out an exercise based on a simulated grounding of a loaded oil tanker off the island of rhum <e> <s> the lessons learned will be applied in the further development of arrangements for dealing with pollution incidents in these waters <e>", "<cs> my lords the inquiry to which i referred does not include that aspect <e>", "<cs> my lords the decision progressively to reduce financial support for development education in britain and to disband the advisory committee was taken after the most careful consideration and in the light of our current review of public expenditure <e> <s> we wish to record our gratitude to the committee for its unstinting work over the past years <e>", "<cs> my lords if we decide as we have done progressively to run down our programme of development education then the advisory committee on that subject must clearly be reconsidered too <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether the noble lord quite understood my original answer or per haps the answer to his first supplementary <e> <s> i said that we had decided progressively to run down our programme of development education <e> <s> the advisory committee on that subject of which the noble lord was of course one of the distinguished members has among its tasks the job of deciding where to direct the funds available to that programme <e> <s> if these funds are being withdrawn then clearly a major part of the task of the committee must be reviewed and that is what we have done <e>", "<cs> my lords after three questions i am beginning to wonder whether it is not my th birthday <e> <s> president brezhnevs intention to withdraw a limited number of soviet troops and tanks from the german democratic republic is an indication that the russians may now be willing to negotiate seriously for an mbfr agreement <e> <s> but the <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may refer to the question of the ss missile because president brezhnev referred to that in his speech <e> <s> there was an offer as we understand it to move a certain number of ss missiles back to new sites east of the urals <e> <s> the offer was i think linked with our agreement not to proceed with modernisation of the tactical nuclear forces which is a matter very much under consideration at the moment <e> <s> but furthermore we have to consider whether moving these missiles to the new sites proposed will greatly decrease their effectiveness <e> <s> we think not <e> <s> as to the significance of the announcement generally president brezhnev did not link the intended unilateral withdrawal of soviet troops and tanks from the gdr with the mbfr negotiations <e> <s> we look forward to receiving further clarification from the soviet union as to how this announcement may relate to the vienna negotiations and to the agreed objective of establishing parity in military manpower in central europe <e>", "<cs> my lords no such offer was included in president brezhnevs recent speech <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the governments intention to introduce new legislation before any change is made in the existing policy guidance under the civil aviation act <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i cannot forecast the content of the legislation <e> <s> i am afraid i must ask my noble friend to await its publication but i can say that the publication will be very soon <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the government are satisfied that british interests are safeguarded <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord ferrier referred during the course of his speech to the thought that he was here among the big guns this evening and i was reminded of an occasion a few months ago when we were in opposition <e> <s> i went to south wales to a constituency which has hardly ever returned a conservative mp certainly not recently <e> <s> of course that is why no one more senior was sent <e>

to deal with a point raised by the noble lord lord george-brown <e> <s> perhaps i can refer to it now <e> <s> he was concerned rightly about difficulties which he experienced and he gave some of his

in touch with the nigerian authorities but detailed discussions between them in respect of compensation for bps assets which were nationalised by the federal military government have yet to take place and no compensation has so far been paid <e>", "<cs> my lords the principal reason has been a change of government in nigeria <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government have consistently and clearly stated their opposition to the boycott and have expressed the wish that <e>", "<cs> i cannot answer for the united states my lords <e> <s> we have to judge this matter from our own british interests

for the dutch position to which the noble lord referred it is true that a number of resolutions have passed through the dutch parliament recently but these have not yet been brought into law by the dutch government <e>", "<cs> my lords we will do that when we judge it in our interest to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords we would certainly be ready to discuss this question in the european forum should it be raised but we know of no desire that it should be <e>", "<cs> we have no plans to raise it at present my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i can go no further than i did before when i said that we will do that only when we judge it to be in our interests <e>", "<cs> my lords the authentication process as the noble lord and the members of that committee will know is only the authentication of the signature to the document it has no relation to the content or accuracy of the document itself <e> <s> we have recently taken steps as i announecd the other day to make that doubly clear to those who use this service <e>", "<cs> certainly not my lords <e> <s> british interest in terms of trade with the arab countries is just as important as trade with israel <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier i cannot answer for the government of the united states <e> <s> we have to judge our interests as we find them and the american government must do likewise <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the government oppose all boycotts which lack international sanction and authority <e> <s> we deplore the limitations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am interested to hear that and it confirms my view that our predecessors were just as anxious as we are to maintain british interests <e>", "<cs> as the noble and learned lord has said the purpose of the <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord explained this amendment falls into two parts <e> <s> it was agreed at lusaka <e>", "<cs> i think it will be for your lordships convenience if i speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and at this moment <e> <s> the arguments that i shall deploy are broadly in line and i think that the arguments the noble and learned lord would want to make are also broadly in line on those three amendments <e>", "<cs> if i may say then procedurally i shall answer this amendment and we shall dispose of it and then the noble and learned lord will decide what to do with the subsequent amendments but not speak to them <e> <s> subsection of clause provides that the constitution order is to be laid before parliament after being made <e> <s> there is thus no provision for parliamentary control over the order <e> <s> this subsection follows normal practice <e> <s> it has not been the practice either of this government or of previous governments to make an order granting an independence constitution subject either to the affirmative resolution procedure or the negative resolution procedure <e>", "<cs> i am not able to respond to that point at this moment but i am not sure that it is exactly relevant <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend explained earlier this afternoon and as my other noble friend lord soames repeated in his winding up of the second reading debate the purpose of the bill is to allow the government to implement an agreement quickly <e> <s> the constitution itself has been agreed by the parties to the constitutional conference and will not itself be subject to parliamentary procedure <e> <s> it would therefore be quite disproportionate to insist that orders to bring parts of it into effect for the purpose of holding elections should be subject to prior parliamentary approval <e>", "<cs> i fully accept the modest effects which my noble friend lord gridley intends of the amendment but i am not sure that the modest effects which he intended are in fact the effects which will flow from the amendment if we were to agree to it <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend the foreign and commonwealth secretary answered a similar question from the noble lord yesterday and i have nothing to add to the reply he gave then <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords supplementary contains a number of assertions with which i would disagree but i would remind the noble lord and the house that a war is going on in that part of the world <e> <s> we certainly deplore that fact <e> <s> noble lords will recall that when the conference began at lancaster house some weeks ago we invited all the parties to that war to enter into a cease-fire <e> <s> the bishops parties in salisbury agreed to that ceasefire but the other parties did not <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we deeply regret that the war continues but i can only repeat that we invited all the parties to enter into a cease-fire at the beginning of the conference <e> <s> the muzorewa party did agree to a cease-fire but the patriotic front did not <e>", "<cs> my lords i could not agree to condemn the actions of one side only <e> <s> we regret all the military operations that are occurring in the war in that part of the world and i can only say yet again for the third time that we have invited all the parties to enter into a cease-fire <e> <s> if only they would <e>", "<cs> yes of course my lords <e> <s> all military operations invite retaliation <e>", "<cs> not particularly <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble lord can have listened to what i said <e> <s> yes of course we regret that the rhodesian authorities mounted this attack into zambia but we also regret the attacks mounted from zambia into rhodesia <e>", "<cs> my lords this is primarily a matter for british caledonian subject only to their ability to secure the necessary licences from the civil aviation authority <e> <s> the governments role is limited in the main to the negotiation of international traffic rights to enable such licences to be exploited <e>", "<cs> my lords yes indeed under the bill to which my noble friend referred the requirements for the government to issue guidelines to the civil aviation authority will be removed and it will thereafter be open to any carrier including british caledonian and british airways to apply to the authority for whatever licences they think they need <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i do <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not the historical facts in front of me <e> <s> it is certainly the case at present anyway that the south american routes operated by british caledonian appear to be going very well <e>", "<cs> my lords that is correct <e> <s> under the procedure that has been in being for a good many years it is first of all the responsibility of the relevant authority in this case the civil aviation authority to grant a licence <e> <s> it then falls to the government to obtain the necessary traffic rights under the appropriate bilateral agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords as i told the noble lord on the st june the issues involved are complex and i am afraid i have nothing to add to the answer which i then gave him <e>", "<cs> my lords the matter is now in the hands of the director of public prosecutions and we have to await his report before we can give an answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not be so happy listening to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i now answer the private notice question of my noble friend lord gisborough by repeating a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the lord privy seal about the mobilisation of zambian military forces against zimbabwe-rhodesia <e> <s> in particular i apologise to the noble marquess lord ailesbury for intervening before his maiden speech <e> <s> i hope that he will forgive me <e> <s> the statement is as follows on th november president kaunda announced the full mobilisation of his countrys resources as a result of recent rhodesian raids on bridges in zambia <e> <s> my right honourable friend the prime minister sent a personal message to president kaunda on th november expressing her concern and the governments determination to bring all such incidents to a speedy end <e> <s> my right honourable and noble friend is seeing the zambian high commissioner this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may answer the interventions first <e> <s> to take the point made by my noble friend lord gisborough yes i am afraid it is the case that cross-border raids from zambia into rhodesia are continuing <e> <s> indeed mr mugabe whose forces are not generally speaking based in zambia actually called upon his supporters to intensify their raids only recently and we regretted that very much indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts asks me how recently <e> <s> certainly within the last few days <e> <s> i am not suggesting that the recent rhodesian attacks into zambia were a response to that but certainly mr mugabes exhortations were not helpful <e> <s> the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts also asked me whether the agreement so far reached was not conditional for its effect upon the further agreement of a cease-fire <e> <s> indeed that is certainly the case <e> <s> the noble lord asked me about our specific protests to the rhodesians as a result of these raids <e> <s> the government are very deeply concerned at the increase in tension which has developed between rhodesia and zambia in recent days and it is essential for all parties to exercise the greatest restraint at this crucial time <e> <s> i hope that that conveys our feeling on this matter sufficiently <e>", "<cs> my lords no that is not our aim <e> <s> our aim is to achieve a comprehensive settlement at the conference at lancaster house so that elections can be held in rhodesia and so that the rhodesians themselves can decide who they should have as their government <e> <s> it is not true to say as the noble lord is suggesting that we are hoping and expecting that the bishop will win the forthcoming elections <e> <s> our primary purpose now having reached agreement on the political and constitutional matters is to bring the war to an end <e> <s> i would remind your lordships that that war has now been going on for five years people are already dead another die every week and many more are maimed injured and bereaved <e> <s> i hope your lordships will agree that the government policy which is aimed at bringing that war to an end is the right one <e>", "<cs> my lords it is also the case that there are major military operations being mounted from zambia and other countries into rhodesia <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly the case that when the conference opened at lancaster house or weeks ago now my noble friend the foreign secretary invited all the parties to the conflict in that part of the world to agree to a cease-fire at least for the duration of the conference <e> <s> the salisbury parties agreed to that ceasefire and it was a matter of great regret that the patriotic front did not <e> <s> certainly had they done so there would be a ceasefire now <e> <s> we hope that the new proposals that we have recently tabled will soon commend themselves to the parties and that a cease-fire can be then brought into force <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly condemn all military actions that are going on in that part of the world including the actions of the rhodesian government and the actions of the other parties to the conflict <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord refers to the history of zambian participation in the sanctions and he is right to do so <e> <s> certainly they have been in the front line of the sanctions war in that part of the world <e> <s> indeed they still are as the noble lord reminds me <e> <s> i should perhaps tell your lordships that we have recently agreed to supply the zambians with tons of maize and rather more than half of this has so far been supplied <e> <s> i say that in answer to the point made by the noble baroness that their food supplies were being disrupted <e> <s> we are asked to be more forthright in our defence of zambia <e> <s> i wonder whether this would really be helpful <e> <s> we are quite persuaded that to appear one-handed in this matter would not help to reduce the armed conflict it would intensify it and it would certainly not help progress at the lancaster house talks <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord reminds the house the commonwealth heads of government at their lusaka meeting earlier this year clearly laid down the lines upon which we ought to proceed <e> <s> but the responsibility for doing so rests with the british government and we are now discharging that responsibility <e> <s> however i can say that throughout the lancaster house talks our commonwealth colleagues have been kept fully informed <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have no such plans because they do not believe that it is for them to <e>", "<cs> my lords the government do not oppose the concept of development education <e> <s> the point at issue is whether we should support it with public funds <e> <s> our aid budget being under extreme pressure as it is we had to take a number of decisions about economies <e> <s> one of them was that expenditure of million no less which was proposed by the previous administration in this connection was out of line with what we could afford and we therefore decided drastically to prune that programme <e> <s> the purpose of the advisory committee was to decide what to do with those funds and clearly once we had withdrawn the bulk of the funds the purpose of the committee disappeared also <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that the governments decision will stop development education <e> <s> voluntary groups churches and other organisations and individuals have shown their concern and initiative in this field for many years before government grants were available <e> <s> i hope that they will continue to do so <e>", "<cs> for the purpose of hearing the statement i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords may i now intervene with your lordships permission to answer the private notice question by the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts by repeating a statement being made in another place by my honourable friend the minister of state mr ridley <e>

their response to the statement <e> <s> as regards the points raised by the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts i am not <e>", "<cs> my lords we have asked all commonwealth countries to say whether they wish to send observers <e> <s> replies are still being received <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that there is not a confusion in the mind of the noble lord <e> <s> his question refers to an observer force but the noble lords supplementary question led me to wonder whether he was not referring to the cease-fire monitoring force which is something quite separate <e> <s> the noble lord then referred to the question of a commonwealth force and i presume he was meaning a commonwealth cease-fire monitoring force and not commonwealth observers <e> <s> we are fully cognisant of the commonwealth position on this matter which was clearly laid down at the commonwealth heads of government meeting at lusaka <e> <s> none the less it is a british responsibility and we intend to meet our responsibilities to the full <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the replies to invitations to be observers of the electoral procedure i do not have in front of me the names of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that that is the missing ace <e> <s> the missing ace is simpler than that it is the question of whether or not the patriotic front will now agree to a cease-fire broadly in accordance with the terms put forward by my noble friend at the conference <e> <s> as your lordships will know the salisbury parties have agreed to the government proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is asking me to comment upon a wholly hypothetical situation <e> <s> we are working towards a comprehensve settlement and a cease-fire <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord carrington i beg to move that the european communities greek accession bill be now read a second time <e> <s> my noble friend had intended to open this debate himself but because of his preoccupation with other pressing matters well known to your lordships he has regretfully had to withdraw <e> <s> it therefore falls to me to move this second reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord is referring to <e>", "<cs> my lords with but one exception i find heartening support in the house this evening for the greek accession which we have been discussing <e> <s> we are all generally agreed that while we must not underestimate the economic and technical difficulties these are outweighed by the powerful political case in favour of greek accession and indeed enlargement as a whole <e> <s> may i try to deal as best i can with some of the many points that have been raised this evening <e> <s> i apologise to noble lords in advance if some contribution fails to attract my attention but i promise to study <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always possible for greece to enter into a voluntary arrangement on their own bilaterally i suppose <e> <s> however the present position is that there is indeed a voluntary restraint agreement in force <e> <s> this agreement will not continue beyond greek accession on st january <e> <s> after that time we shall be obliged to rely upon the safeguard provision of article <e> <s> i am not sure whether that satisfies the noble lord but i think that is the position <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord is right when he says that thus far article or its equivalent in other treaties and certainly in the irish treaty to which the noble lord lord campbell of croy referred has been used only rarely if at all <e> <s> but it is there in the treaty for greece and we shall use it if we have to <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the cuts in overseas representation announced in the governments white paper on <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is right in inferring from my original answer that we are not proposing to change the present arrangements which are that our ambassador in dakar is accredited also to conakry but i can say that our ambassador in dakar is now making more frequent visits to conakry <e> <s> we are aware of the general desirability of maintaining our representation at the highest level everywhere in the world but we have to cut our coat according to the cloth available <e>", "<cs> my lords i can certainly give an assurance that our representation there will be kept under review <e> <s> it certainly would be our hope to open a mission there when circumstances allow <e> <s> as for trade certainly there has been a <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i would say that businessmen were flocking to guinea as the noble lord suggests <e> <s> the ecgd cover is at present not available except on a short-term basis for our exporters to guinea <e> <s> that matter could certainly be reviewed if the re-scheduled debt difficulty could be overcome <e> <s> as for raising the availability of commercial expertise in the area that is a useful suggestion which i shall look into <e>", "<cs> my lords the declaration covers a great deal of ground and is being carefully studied <e> <s> in general <e>", "<cs> my lords yes we certainly shall bear in mind the importance of these programmes <e> <s> but as i had to say to the noble lord lord hatch of lusby in answer to the previous question we can only cut our coat according to our cloth <e>", "<cs> my lords we already do that within the general framework of our aid programme to individual countries <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the letter in question drew attention to the letter of my noble friend lady young about a question on population control or contraception to be more precise which appeared in a recent o-level paper supposedly following upon one of the recommendations made at this conference <e> <s> speaking personally i certainly agree that the question referred to was entirely inappropriate but i must emphasise that the government have no responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to say that i can give no undertaking that we could do that <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the minister of state for consumer affairs has indicated her intention to broaden the base of consumer consultation by forging more effective links with organisations with a large membership of consumers <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords these mere two organisations specifically concerned with womens interests but of course all the bodies which my right honourable friend consults have some women on them and the views of women are taken very much into account as regard these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord says that my answer is balderdash so is his supplementary <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that those funds have been withdrawn but the same funds have been redirected to other consumer bodies who we think will be more effective <e>", "<cs> my lords they have been consulted <e>", "<cs> my lords the government will continue to press the soviet union to fulfil its commitments under the relevant provisions of the helsinki final act including principle vii which states that the participating states will respect human rights and fundamental freedoms <e>", "<cs> my lords we have considerable sympathy with the view of the noble lord <e> <s> we deplore the continuing violations of basic human rights in the soviet union in particular the rights to freedom of thought expression belief and movement <e> <s> we have recently conveyed to the soviet authorities our concern in this matter <e>", "<cs> that is another question my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords it is for the greetings card industry to decide whether or not to approach the commission for remedial action if it believes that it is suffering injury from dumped russian-made christmas cards <e> <s> officials of the department of trade are ready to give help and advice in the formulation of a case to put to the commission but it is for the commission to investigate allegations of dumping and if appropriate to take the necessary action <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall certainly keep our finger on the pulse in this matter but as i said in my original reply it is primarily for the greetings card industry itself to make representations <e>", "<cs> my lords there is actually a serious implication to this because these cards bearing christian messages are deeply offensive to some people <e> <s> they are of course specifically designed for the british market and indeed most of the cards are based on british designs and are thus comparable both to domestic and other imported cards <e>", "<cs> i am sure my noble friend is right my lords but perhaps it is correct to note that these cards constitute only about per cent of the british market <e>", "<cs> my lords we co-operate actively with our eec partners and in a number of international organisations to contain and reduce the terrorist threat <e> <s> there has been some evidence in the past of contacts between elements affiliated to the palestine liberation organisation and other terrorist organisations <e> <s> we have recently received an assurance from the palestine liberation organisation leadership that any links which its affiliates may have had with the provisional ira have been severed and that neither the plo itself nor any of its affiliates will establish or maintain any such links in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we condemn terrorism wherever it may take place and under whatever guise but the plo itself is essentially a political organisation <e>", "<cs> although i confess that the distinction between it and its terrorist affiliates is not always easy to draw <e> <s> the government condemn unreservedly all terrorist acts committed by organisations linked with the plo <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the meeting which was reported by my right honourable friend the lord privy seal and an official of the plo it was a totally unplanned social encounter <e> <s> it would be i suggest a gratuitous insult to refuse to acknowledge a fellow guest on such an occasion <e> <s> it does not represent a change in the governments policy under which recognition of the plo and formal ministerial contacts remains difficult <e>", "<cs> that is another question my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly welcome the fact that the plo have given us these assurances <e> <s> we shall have to see how they turn out <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said to my noble friend lord lauderdale that was a gratuitous occasion when the meeting was quite inadvertent <e>", "<cs> the noble lord asks me to take a position on terrorism my lords <e> <s> of course i take a position on terrorism we universally condemn it <e>", "<cs> yes my lords of course i will <e>", "<cs> my lords mr arafats appearance at the united nations <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is of course quite right but even more water has flowed under the bridge since then <e>", "<cs> my lords we have frequently expressed concern about the external policies and actions of the soviet union

promote stability outside the nato area <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend knows we are of course already discussing with the chinese the possibility of supplying them with some defence equipment

east and west are participating in the mutual balanced force reduction talks as they are called mbfr at vienna <e> <s> it is a matter for great regret that those talks are not making more progress

improve our transport facilities within the availability of our resources <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and gallant lord lord carver is of course entitled to his views but we have to formulate our policies in accordance with circumstances as we find them not as we would wish them to be <e>", "<cs> my lords answering questions as i do from the noble lord so often i could hardly fail to be aware of the matters he raises <e>", "<cs> my lords the government considered that the proposal to construct a second terminal at gatwick airport was of sufficient importance regionally and nationally for the matter to be determined jointly by my right honourable friends the secretaries of state for the environment and for trade rather than being dealt with by the appropriate local planning authority

consideration of airport policy in the south-east and the question of a second terminal at gatwick is of course part of that consideration <e> <s> i should not want to prejudge the outcome of that consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords the agreement to which the noble baroness refers was as she rightly says entered into by the british airports authority and as i told the house the other week the government were not a party to that agreement and are certainly not bound by it <e> <s> as for the point about the british airports authority there is i am afraid more than one view as to whether the british airports authority were entitled to enter into that agreement <e> <s> the matter could only finally be decided if it came before the courts <e>", "<cs> i think that my noble friend is quite right my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that democracy is sometimes rather tiresome but that does not mean that we should throw it out of the window <e>", "<cs> my noble friend may well be right my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend is suggesting that that was suggested by my other noble friend lord boyd-carpenter then i do not think that i would agree with him <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that if i were to comment upon that i should be pre-empting the statement which is to be made in due course on airport policy in the south-east generally <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has once more raised some extremely pertinent and valid points <e> <s> i shall endeavour to give as full and frank an answer as possible without trespassing too far i hope on your lordships patience <e> <s> on the general question of safeguard arrangements for textiles i must make it clear at the outset that the government are acutely conscious of the need for adequate safeguards for the united kingdom textile industry in the face of low cost imports from abroad <e> <s> one such provision as my noble friend mentioned has been negotiated with greece in the shape of article of the act of accession <e> <s> that article will permit the commission to authorise a member state to take protective measures if serious difficulties arise in the textile sector or indeed any other sector as a result of greek exports <e> <s> this was the best safeguard which it was possible to negotiate but it does not mean that we are entirely happy <e> <s> a gradual phasing out of import controls would clearly have been preferable but the obstacle to that was the fact that there are no formal quota restrictions under the present arrangements <e>", "<cs> i could not answer that question without looking into the matter <e> <s> i think that it probably would be but i shall look into the matter and write to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that i was not clear to my noble friend <e> <s> our understanding is that it would not be <e>", "<cs> my lords may i apologise in advance to your lordships for the fact

taken jointly by my right honourable friends the secretaries of state for the environment and for trade and there are a number of important and difficult issues which have deserved and have received careful study <e> <s> as for the point as to when the terminal could be finished that depends of course on what my right honourable friends decide with regard to the inquiry which has just taken place

have been taken earlier but having seen all the papers on the matter i am quite satisfied that my two right honourable friends have not been unduly long and i think that i can assure my noble friend

community and the membership of the nato alliance are two different matters <e> <s> most of the members of the european community are members of nato but as the noble lord lord shinwell points out the

made by my noble friend lord strathcona and mount royal a little later this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the telegram referred to was from members of the european parliament not members

obliged to both noble lords for their reception of this statement <e> <s> may i take up the points made by the noble earl lord amherst to start with <e> <s> he asked me two specific questions to which i can respond now <e> <s> first the question of transfers to stansted <e> <s> we have reached no decision on any encouraged transfers can i call them that <e> <s> to stansted although we would certainly like to see the development of charter services from that airport <e> <s> with regard to the british rail link between stansted and london there is presently a service between bishops stortford and liverpool street which as a matter of fact is pretty good <e> <s> i have used it myself on several occasions <e> <s> certainly if we came to develop stansted beyond what is immediately foreshadowed by the statement namely the single terminal and single runway we would have to think of improving that link and perhaps extending it into the airport itself <e> <s> but that is certainly not part of the immediate plan <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i can answer both those questions <e> <s> the maximum number of passengers that stansted could carry with one runway would be of the order of million passengers a year <e> <s> that would probably need more terminals than we are presently anticipating but that is certainly the maximum capacity of the single runway <e> <s> as for the proposal to develop maplin along the lines that have been canvassed in various quarters we think that the sums of money which the promoters of these schemes have in mind are wildly optimistic <e> <s> the sort of figure that we think would be the cost of developing maplin now would be about million roughly double the sort of figure that we have seen canvassed in the press <e> <s> that was one of the main reasons that caused us to go for another solution <e>", "<cs> that is a very interesting point my lords the environmental considerations were certainly well forward in my right honourable friends consideration of this matter <e> <s> they are not quite so simple as people make out <e> <s> although it is true that maplin would be developed if it were to be built on reclaimed land one must remember that we should also have to build a motorway and a railway together with a great deal of other local infrastructure to support that new airport if we were to go ahead while the railway and road already exist to stansted indeed so does the nucleus of the airport itself <e> <s> we do not necessarily accept that the enormous environmental advantages claimed for the maplin idea are really as convincing as people would have us believe <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> that project was considered but did not really seem to be an effective solution to the problems of south-east england <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right when he says <e>", "<cs> my lords we would not agree that the disastrous results foreshadowed by many people as a result of this decision will take place we think the difficulties have been greatly overestimated <e> <s> as for a public inquiry as the statement says there will be a public inquiry into the second phase of the development of stanstead and that will certainly give an opportunity for all local interests to say their piece <e>", "<cs> my lords manston aerodrome in kent is used already to some extent by civil aircraft but on a comparatively small scale <e> <s> i cannot say that manston formed part of our consideration as a solution to the problems of airport capacity in the south-east generally but it certainly is used at present <e>", "<cs> my lords the statement says <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is correct my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to say that i was wrong <e> <s> the noble lord is quite right and i apologise to my noble friend lord nugent of guildford and to the noble lord lord leatherland <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill which the government submit for your lordships approval tonight is the last major legislative step we have to take before we lay down our final direct responsibility in africa <e> <s> our withdrawal from that continent has on the whole i think been achieved with dignity and justice <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite accept that but it would probably be convenient if i deal with the points raised by the noble lord as they are of interest to several other noble lords <e> <s> indeed i see the noble lord now taking his seat <e> <s> the noble lord raised several points about the administration of rhodesia under the governor <e> <s> however i think that his expectations may be a little too great <e> <s> my noble friend has been in rhodesia for only five days <e> <s> although he is certainly giving urgent attention to the issues raised by the noble lord i am afraid that they cannot all be resolved immediately <e>", "<cs> my lords neither side claims to hold any prisoners of war at present but as i have said the governor will certainly be reviewing the cases of those detained at least those cases to which he has access <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i would be wise to consider the implications of that question before i answer certainly before i answer in public <e> <s> i shall consider it and write to the noble lord <e> <s> all the major issues of the constitutional conference are now resolved <e>", "<cs> my lords there are certainly no units of the south african forces in rhodesia but there are individuals of various nationalities serving in the rhodesian armed forces <e> <s> however the only forces in rhodesia in this period will be the rhodesian armed forces and the patriotic front forces <e> <s> we have made it clear at the conference and elsewhere that we do not contemplate any kind of purge of the personnel of the forces of either side <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble baroness and the house that the governor is taking steps to get maize moving into zambia as quickly as possible <e> <s> the noble baroness may also recall that i answered a question in the house a week or so ago about maize being provided by the british government from another source and that is also moving into zambia <e>", "<cs> yes my lords my noble friend asked for a considered reply <e> <s> i will do just that consider the matter and write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i do not think we are questioning the right of the government to grant independence <e> <s> surely this bill gives the government the right to grant independence <e> <s> we are simply talking about the day on which we do it <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i cannot agree to either of the proposals put to me by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> as my noble and learned friend stressed in his second reading speech the government have asked both sides of the constitutional conference to make concessions <e> <s> they have agreed to our proposals on the understanding that provided they fulfil the agreed conditions independence will he forthcoming <e> <s> the rhodesian parliament has been dissolved and bishop muzorewa and his colleagues are standing aside in the belief that an irreversible process is being engaged leading to independence <e>", "<cs> no not at the moment <e> <s> there will need to be consultation with the governor and with the parties and it may be that the final date for independence is not set till a later stage in the process which i have described <e> <s> the government must have reasonable flexibility in this matter <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord davies of leek said the position in rhodesia was unique because of udi <e> <s> but udi is at an end legality has returned to rhodesia and i am afraid i cannot accept the proposals which have been put to us <e>", "<cs> me again i am afraid my lords <e> <s> i beg to move that the southern rhodesia constitution interim provisions order a copy of which was laid before this house on th december be approved <e> <s> the order was made on rd december under powers contained in section of the southern rhodesia act <e> <s> it is subject to affirmative resolution of both houses within days <e> <s> sections and of the order came into operation on th december <e> <s> the remainder of the order was brought into effect on th december by a notice signed by my noble friend the foreign and commonwealth secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords those are perfectly proper questions to which i confess i do not have the answer at this moment but i will find out the answer and write to the noble lord <e> <s> i do not think your lordships would wish me to rehearse again all the arguments that we have been through this evening <e> <s> i hope your lordships will now agree to pass this order <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> as my honourable friend mr blaker <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i cannot foresee any increase in the services broadcast to that part of the world <e> <s> i must say that we believe that the present services are very satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly agree about the importance of these services but i am afraid that with the present constraints upon our resources in that area i cannot foresee any increase <e> <s> however i certainly agree about their importance <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> as your lordships will know we are having a debate tomorrow evening about the british council and my noble friend might like to put his point during that debate <e>", "<cs> my lords the additional funds referred to by my noble friend and mentioned by my honourable friend mr blaker in another place will be used to improve the audibility of the bbc external services <e> <s> there is no plan to extend the vernacular services <e>", "<cs> my lords i will take a careful note of what the noble baroness has said look into the matter and let her know what is being done <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e> <s> the support which greek accession commands throughout the house has been very gratifying <e> <s> during the earlier stages of the bill a number of your lordships underlined the basic political reason for welcoming greece into the european economic community namely the need to assist in consolidating the new democracy there <e> <s> that is indeed the crux of the matter <e> <s> some of your lordships have also quite properly pointed out the implications of widening the membership of the community to include not just greece but also two other southern european economies portugal and spain <e> <s> the problems for the community of having to adjust to the increase of the membership to twelve as with the earlier increase to nine will be considerable <e> <s> to resolve them the community will need to display an effort of will and imagination similar to that shown by the founding fathers of the community <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i will repeat a statement about rhodesia being made by my right honourable friend the lord privy seal in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to both noble lords for what they have said in response to the statement <e> <s> certainly i shall convey all their good wishes to my noble friend the foreign and commonwealth secretary <e> <s> i shall also convey to my noble friend what the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts has said about his desire for the order about the date of independence <e> <s> i can give no undertaking i am afraid as to what my noble friend will decide on this matter but i will bring the noble lords words to his attention <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the point about the amnesty is an important one <e> <s> the precise details of the amnesty will be published in the form of a governors ordinance within the next few days <e> <s> the ordinance will set out the terms of the amnesty and i will arrange for a copy of the document to be placed in the library of the house <e> <s> it will apply to acts done in good faith by both sides since udi <e> <s> it will be those acts all acts done in good faith in the furtherance of <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> we believe that these will provide fully adequate capacity for all the patriotic front forces <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to consider that <e> <s> i shall certainly be writing to the noble lord as i promised but i should wish to consider further whether the matter should be made public <e>", "<cs> my lords i can answer the second point readily <e> <s> the question of additional places will arise only if the patriotic front forces assemble with their arms and equipment in numbers greater than can be dealt with at ail the assembly places designated in the cease-fire agreement <e> <s> we do not expect that that situation will arise <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly do not foresee one side firing on the other <e> <s> this is what i think seems to be in the noble lords mind <e> <s> we think that the best way to contain any potential breach of the cease-fire is by self-discipline on both sides <e>", "<cs> my lords the record of implementation of the helsinki final act by certain of the countries during the year as a whole somewhat deteriorated <e> <s> the government have drawn attention to these trends in their detailed report on implementation made in another place on th november <e> <s> i am arranging for a copy of the text of this report to be published in the <e>", "<cs> my lords planning figures for aid disbursements are based on intentions and assumptions which may not be realised aid commit <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i cannot give an indication of the countries upon which these cuts may fall <e> <s> as i said in my original answer such an indication would be full of ambiguity and would be misleading <e>", "<cs> my lords we are certainly considering what we can do for rhodesia in these new circumstances <e> <s> however it is exactly that type of reason which makes it so difficult to plan ahead accurately and give reliable forecasts of the amount of money that we are going to spend for individual countries when sudden and unforeseen demands upon our resources arise <e>", "<cs> my lords i can certainly give the assurance that we will give urgent attention to the needs of zambia and the neighbouring countries <e> <s> with regard to the item of million which was contained in the statement which i repeated yesterday i can confirm that that sum is specifically for expenditure incurred during the transitional period and is primarily the cost of the monitoring forces <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that we do too badly with our aid programme <e> <s> we are planning to spend in the current year something like million on our total aid programme which i do not think is too bad <e> <s> as the noble lord reminds me that is about per cent <e> <s> of our gross national product which is a lot of money all the same when one actually has to write the cheque for it <e> <s> we are absolutely determined to keep our aid programme and all our other expenditure programmes within our resources <e>", "<cs> my lords i desire at the outset on behalf of the government to be associated with the remarks made about the awful tragedy that has befallen the noble lord lord ballantrae and to join with other noble lords who have extended their sympathy to him <e>", "<cs> my lords we accept all these important roles for the british council <e> <s> the difficulty is that we cannot write cheques when there is no money in the bank <e>", "<cs> yes my lords through our contribution to the general programme of the united nations high commissioner for refugees the world food programme and the united nations childrens fund all of which are helping these refugees <e> <s> united kingdom contributions to european community resources also support the communitys pledges to the united nations high commissioners general programme and the world food programme <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i accept what my noble friend has said and i can say that we are ready to consider very sympathetically any application made to us by the pakistanis for bilateral aid in this matter of course within our resources <e> <s> but i must say that no such application has so far been received <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only repeat what i said earlier that we are ready to consider most sympathetically any application for bilateral aid in this matter within the limits of our resources but no such application has yet been received <e> <s> with regard to the number i am afraid that both my noble friends are out of date <e> <s> the number we have now is <e>", "<cs> my lords we have made it clear that we hope to play our part in assisting zambia to redevelop its economy and infrastructure which have been severely affected by the rhodesian conflict <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i would not accept that we had responsibility in this matter <e> <s> we had no control over the rhodesian forces at the time of the raids and we do not i am afraid accept any responsibility for damage caused by them <e>", "<cs> my lords we are referring to the unhappy but inevitable consequences of the conflict in that part of the world <e> <s> but as noble lords know the cease-fire agreement has now been initialled and will be signed tomorrow and i do not think we ought to go back over that now <e>", "<cs> my lords i prefer not to continue the emotive language which we hear from the noble lord on these matters <e> <s> the agreement has now been initialled and it will be signed tomorrow <e> <s> this is i should have thought a major step forward <e> <s> as for the general question of aid to zambia we are willing as i have said to help in the general cause of reconstructing their infrastructure and we hope to have discussions with them shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think we use those terms but it is fair to say as the noble lord has pointed out that the zambians were in the forefront of the difficulties in that part of the world and we are all delighted that they are now coming to an end <e>", "<cs> my lords british airways operate a bus link from victoria terminal to and from heathrow airport <e> <s> passenger demand for such services has reduced since the opening of the underground link with heathrow and the service is unprofitable <e> <s> its provision is a matter for the british airways board who keep the economics of the operation under constant review <e> <s> at the moment british airways have no plans to curtail or expand the service <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is asking for a viable bus service and that the public should have the right to subscribe to such a viable bus service <e> <s> they have had several chances to do that <e> <s> the present service is not viable and indeed the service from the west london air terminal was not viable either <e> <s> that is why they were withdrawn <e>", "<cs> my lords this is primarily a matter for british airways <e> <s> as i have said british airways have no plans to withdraw this service at the present time <e> <s> as for the future i am afraid my crystal ball is no better than that of the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in the statement which i repeated in this house before christmas the government certainly have it as their policy to encourage the fullest use of regional airports including those in wales <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is rather a different question <e>", "<cs> my lords there are many parts of london which do not enjoy a direct tube service <e> <s> i am not sure that the expense of the project envisaged by the noble lord would be justified <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords as i told the noble lord on th november bp are in touch with the nigerian authorities <e> <s> her majestys government are also in contact with the new nigerian government on this question <e> <s> i would prefer not to say more at this stage <e>", "<cs> yes of course my lords <e> <s> we deeply deplore the original action taken by the nigerian government <e> <s> however i would point out that there is now a new government in nigeria <e> <s> we <e>", "<cs> my lords we were not in touch with the new government when i spoke from this box on the subject a while ago but we are now in touch with the new government <e>", "<cs> my lords we and our allies support the continuation of the salt process and approved in december a united states offer to negotiate with the soviet union within the salt iii framework limitations on land-based long-range theatre nuclear missiles <e> <s> the soviet union has so far responded negatively to this offer <e>", "<cs> my lords we are always ready to discuss meaningfully with the soviet union in conjunction with our allies but it is perhaps worth while pointing out that present negotiations the mbfr talks at vienna for example are virtually stalled and no significant progress has been made for some time <e> <s> with regard to the salt process we hope that despite the present hiatus that will continue <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord strathcona said to your lordships on th december the government consider that the nato decision on the modernisation of the alliances long-range theatre nuclear forces and the parallel arms control offer are highly satisfactory all the more so i would have thought in view of recent events in afghanistan <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly hope that the vienna talks can make some progress in the near future but the noble lord will know as well as i do the difficulties there have been at those talks and the problems we have encountered <e> <s> my lords is it not the case that world security relies for its existence on the belief that the west can technically at least live at peace with the soviet union and its satellites <e> <s> that belief i submit has been shaken to its foundations by <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that is right <e>", "<cs> my lords as i made clear when i repeated the statement on airports policy on th december the government have decided not to pursue the proposal to construct a second runway at gatwick <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that offhand i cannot think of another airport in the world where the sort of numbers projected for gatwick are carried at present <e> <s> but of course it is proposed that the large numbers anticipated for gatwick namely million per annum with one terminal or million per annum with two terminals relate to some years ahead when the size <e>", "<cs> my lords the question on the order paper relates to gatwick but the expansion of stansted referred to by the noble lord was indeed included in my statement to which i referred earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend asked me two questions the first one about whether the airlines agree that it will be possible to carry this number of passengers through gatwick <e> <s> this really is a matter for the british airports authority but their forecasts depend for fulfilment upon certain assumptions relating to the growth and the numbers of movements and an increase in the average number of passengers per movement and as i said earlier at present we do not have any cause to disagree with the baa in these forecasts <e> <s> as to the question of the timing of a debate on this matter in your lordships house i should welcome such a debate but the question of timing must be a matter for my noble friend <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i will ask my noble friend the chief whip whether he can arrange that <e> <s> as to the first supplementary question put by the noble baroness speaking from memory i think it is right to say that the freight terminal recently constructed at gatwick is along one of the possible lines for a second runway but as i have said we do not in any event foresee a second runway at gatwick <e>", "<cs> my lords there have been a number of recent improvements to the road access to gatwick <e> <s> this is really a question for the local authorities concerned but i understand that the west sussex county council have a proposal to provide a link from the east to the m at copthorne <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord is referring to the emergency runway which is proposed <e> <s> the baa have now planning permission to widen and strengthen the northern taxiway at gatwick to make it into an emergency runway and if they go ahead with that proposal that runway would be <e>", "<cs> my lords with the permission of the house i shall now repeat a statement being made in another place in answer to a private notice question on diplomatic relations with chile and in so doing answer the private notice question of the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> i will reply to the last question if i may my lords <e> <s> i am obliged to the noble lords lord goronwy-roberts and lord gladwyn for what they said <e> <s> in answer to lord goronwy-roberts i would say that we have for some time been giving careful consideration to all aspects of our relations with chile and we have now decided that our best interests are no longer served by the absence of ambassadors <e> <s> in regard to the case of dr sheila cassidy the chilean government have expressed very serious concern about dr cassidys case <e> <s> they assure us they have carried out the most exhaustive possible investigations and they have sincerely regretted any improper treatment dr cassidy received during her detention <e> <s> lord gladwyn asked about mr bosier <e> <s> investigations into his fate are still being conducted by the chilean courts and the chilean government have given us assurances that the authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may reply to both the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords we have to be careful about not seeking to interfere in the internal affairs of another nation however much we may disapprove of their domestic policies <e> <s> if we adoped the sort of policies suggested by the noble lord we should be seeking guarantees from at least half the nations of the world and would probably have to withdraw at least half our ambassadors <e>", "<cs> my lords it is fair to say i am reminded of this from behind that the withdrawal of our ambassador took place under the previous administration <e> <s> we have considered the matter afresh since coming to office and have now reached the conclusion which has been announced this afternoon and i believe we have good reasons for doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only conclude that the previous administration applied the same criteria as we do namely that they took their decisions on these matters in the light of how best to serve british interests <e> <s> perhaps they did not always interpret our interests in the same way and that is only understandable but that is the reason why we have made this decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i have certainly many times from this box condemned abuses of human rights wherever they may occur in the world and we shall continue to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the aviation security fund second amendment regulations a draft of which was laid before this house on th december be approved <e> <s> these regulations amend earlier ones made under section of the civil aviation act and will come into force on st february next <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to all noble lords and the noble baroness for their interventions this afternoon <e> <s> several of your lordships especially the noble baroness have challenged the whole principle of aviation security being paid for by the air traveller rather than the government <e> <s> these regulations do not concern the principle which was established in narrowly as the noble baroness reminded us <e> <s> nevertheless it is right to answer the point that she has made <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble baroness for not dealing with that point <e> <s> the british airports authority did ask whether they could drop out of the fund for this year <e> <s> i am afraid we turned down the request <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e> <s> in these few very brief words i should like first to express my gratitude to your lordships for your reception of this bill and for the swift passage which you have accorded it through this house <e> <s> for while i believe that your lordships will agree with me when i say that this bill must be one of the less controversial with which we have had to deal none the less its provisions are important <e> <s> for example they will allow the citizens of papua new guinea western samoa and nauru to enjoy the same status as other members of the commonwealth in united kingdom law and at the same time remove the few remaining anomalies in our own legislation which might still affect the citizens <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to move the first motion standing in my name on the order paper namely that the southern rhodesia constitution of zimbabwe elections and appointments order be approved <e> <s> with your lordships permission at the same time i shall speak to the second motion standing in my name on the order paper and then move the latter only formally when we come to it <e> <s> in my speech i shall deal with the orders in the reverse order to which they appear on the order paper because that was how i expected them to appear on the order paper <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will not be unduly confused by that <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try to deal as best i can with the considerable number of points which have been raised <e> <s> noble lords will no doubt intervene to remind me if i forget any and those that i am not reminded of i shall deal with in correspondence at a later time <e> <s> may i begin by thanking those of your lordships who were kind enough to speak warmly of my noble friend lord soames and his achievements <e> <s> i shall certainly ensure that these sentiments are conveyed to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to tell the noble and learned lord that i simply have not got the information that he requires <e> <s> i think i ought to have it and i apologise for the fact that i have not but i will find out and let him know <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall have to keep this matter under very careful review <e> <s> i was asked to give an assurance that mr mugabe would not be allowed to return to rhodesia before these men had been released <e> <s> i am not able to give that assurance but i can say that the government attach no less importance to this matter than the noble lord lord duncan-sandys and other noble lords <e> <s> we will take such steps as are open to us and as we think necessary to secure the release of these detainees <e>", "<cs> my lords the monitoring force is there to monitor the cease-fire and as i said earlier there is a contingent from the monitoring force near the bridge but we do not envisage the despatch of further british troops to take up a positively defensive or even offensive role in rhodesia <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord is referring to the circumstances which prevailed before the governors arrival but the governor has said and i have repeated it in this house several times that there are indeed some south africans serving in the rhodesian forces including people of other nationalities but they are completely under the command of the rhodesian commanders and are therefore now subject to the governor and the cease-fire arrangements <e> <s> it should be said that there are members of several other nationalities serving in the patriotic front forces including i am <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of any regular south african officers seconded to the rhodesian forces but there are south african nationals serving in the rhodesian forces <e>", "<cs> my lords manna from heaven has arrived and i am able to say that a number of persons were detained by the previous authorities under martial law <e> <s> the governor has ordered <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> that can be simply dealt with <e> <s> the position is that the governor will as the noble and learned lord rightly said appoint the prime minister being the person whom he thinks is best able to command a majority in the house of assembly <e> <s> the other ministers will be appointed upon the recommendation of the prime minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot say what will be the position of the new government when they take office in regard to these liabilities <e> <s> they will certainly not be a liability upon her majestys government <e> <s> i suppose the truthful answer is that they will be the result of negotiations between the creditors and the new government of rhodesia when they come into office <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft dangerous substances and preparations safety regulations laid before the house on th december be approved <e> <s> these regulations are designed primarily to implement an eec directive adopted in july last which requires member states to prohibit the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances in two specific situations <e> <s> they deal with a wide range of substances in relation to ornamental objects such as ornamental lamps and with the use of a carcinogenic chemical known as tris in textile articles intended to come into contact with the skin <e> <s> the regulations also include an existing prohibition on the use of chloroethylene as an aerosol propellant which is simply <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to your lordships for the reception that has been given to these regulations <e> <s> in response to the noble lord lord wallace of coslany i point out that what i need is not safety regulations but a good trade union and i shall see what i can do about that <e> <s> however the noble lord made a point about dressing-gowns <e> <s> it is certainly the case that childrens dressing-gowns often come into contact with a childs skin <e> <s> we felt that we did not want to be exposed to the risk of a manufacturer arguing that it was not intended to come into contact with the skin and that is why childrens dressing-gowns are specifically mentioned in these regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that that is a valid point <e> <s> it was not the one to which i applied my mind and prepared myself to speak this afternoon <e> <s> however i shall consider it further and write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the committee has not met since july last year although the disarmament debate has continued in the united nations general assembly <e> <s> i therefore have nothing to add to the answer i gave to my noble friend on rd october last year <e>", "<cs> my lords yes it is important to have the views of all the members of the committee <e> <s> i can <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall certainly consider all the proposals put forward by the ussr and anyone else <e> <s> but the most important feature of any proposal that we consider must be its capability of proper vertification <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make two points <e> <s> on the question of the mbfr talks in vienna yes it is certainly right that they are principally but not exclusively concerned with conventional weapons although as i mentioned in the house last week i think those talks are now more or

speech i sought to explain the general considerations which led the government to frame their airports policy and the steps we propose to take to provide for the expected growth in air transport demand in the years to come <e> <s> i am grateful to all noble lords for the balanced views which have been expressed not all being in agreement of course during this debate and i shall deal as best i

noble lord knows the government do not recognise the national assembly because it is based on the unilateral elections of december which were not consistent with the plan with which we were associated

the kilometres that he mentioned <e>", "<cs> i understand that it would be convenient if we now took the statement <e> <s> i therefore beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> if we can

the fair trading act dealing with monopolies but as yet there is no basis for any particular modification <e>", "<cs> i did not say that it did <e>", "<cs> i must confess that while i was considering how to answer this amendment the sort of situation described by my noble friend was not one of the ones which occurred to me <e> <s> however the bill is concerned only with competition in the united kingdom market and the definition of anticompetitive practices in clause therefore confines the director generals consideration to practices which affect competition in the united kingdom <e> <s> practices whose only effect is to restrict competition in the supply of goods in overseas markets are therefore outside the scope of the bill as it stands <e> <s> we recognise however that there may well be practices related primarily to exports but which may have some immediate effect on competition in the supply or production of goods in the united kingdom and they are therefore within the scope of the bill <e> <s> but i do not think that was the sort of thing that was in the mind of my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord for moving this amendment although i hope i can explain that he need not press it <e> <s> as the noble lord will be aware we shall shortly be discussing government amendments the purpose of which is to bring within the scope of the anti-competitive practice provisions of the bill certain practices relating to the supply of a site for a holiday caravan and for the provision of off-street parking facilities <e>", "<cs> i do not know about that <e> <s> the noble lord has certainly raised a very interesting point <e> <s> i will certainly undertake to ensure that the consideration currently being given to the desirability for example of amending the landlord and tenant act also includes the very interesting point raised by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> if your lordships will allow me i shall not repeat the arguments which i put forward in connection with the last amendment except to say that the inquiries to which i referred were not specifically directed at the landlord and tenant act that was just one of the possibilities that we envisaged <e> <s> the amendment as it stands would i fear have a very limiting effect <e> <s> it would provide that the secretary of state must specify in advance the types of conduct which might constitute anticompetitive practices <e>", "<cs> i think if the noble lord will allow me to say so that those words are already present in the bill <e> <s> i refer to him the sub-section under discussion <e> <s> i am reading from lines and where it says <e>", "<cs> my noble friends amendment seeks to exempt certain mat <e>", "<cs> no not necessarily <e> <s> perhaps i did not make myself as clear as i should have done <e> <s> there may be some grounds for exemption in regard to some of the bus services and transport services to which my noble friend refers but it might be more sensible and more appropriate for exemptions in this area to be made under subordinate legislation that is to say by order so that it could be more easily varied with any subsequent changes in policy or in the other legislation to which he referred <e> <s> i assure my noble friend that the government will give care <e>", "<cs> i am quite content that we should discuss them together if the noble lord wishes <e>", "<cs> we do not consider it necessary or desirable to bring in health authorities <e> <s> in their case procurement is done in accordance with instructions issued by the relevant health department and that departments ministers are directly answerable to parliament for any procurement practices <e> <s> equally unless evidence is brought forward that purchasing practices of other non-trading bodies are a cause for concern there is no call we say to extend the scope of the bill to the other persons as the amendment seeks to do <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i do not agree with the noble baroness <e> <s> parliamentary scrutiny is or should be the best of all <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord is misinformed in this matter <e> <s> the provisions that he seeks to write into this bill are already contained in the fair trading act <e> <s> we believe therefore that there is no need for this provision <e> <s> where an anti-competitive practice is widespread in an industry it is open to investigation under the act i have referred to <e> <s> the provision of an alternative procedure under this bill therefore would i think serve no particular purpose <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lords party was in office then <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord goes further may i say that i think he is trespassing rather dangerously upon the unwritten rule may be it is a written rule that advice tendered to ministers is kept private <e>", "<cs> that is perfectly fair but the noble lord must not suggest that those are the views of officials and not the views of ministers <e> <s> the views <e>", "<cs> there is nothing wrong in that at all but what the noble lord must not do is ascribe the views contained in that document to civil servants and not to ministers <e>", "<cs> i think we are under a delusion if we imagine there is any halfway house in this matter <e> <s> the choice before us i suggest is on the one hand the procedure that we have laid down in the bill where we do not define precisely the practices which are to be held to be anti-competitive much less unlawful or on the other hand if we do not choose to follow that course then we must provide a comprehensive catalogue of practices which are to be outlawed under the bill <e> <s> that second route is a wholly different philosophy and the one which i suppose the americans have chosen to follow with their anti-trust laws but one which we have i think very soundly and rightly chosen to reject <e>", "<cs> i am certainly quite happy to agree that the director general would consider informal approaches from companies considering adopting a particular line of practice but i would emphasise the point that simply because a company is adopting a particular line of practice which the director general might seek to investigate does not mean that they are breaking the law <e> <s> they are not even breaking the law when they enter into an understanding or agreement with the director general and subsequently depart from it <e> <s> that is a matter we shall be referring to later <e> <s> the ultimate test of whether or not a practice is to be regarded as anti-competitive will eventually come to be decided by the monopolies and mergers commission when it finds the practice if it does to be against the public interest <e> <s> but as your lordships will have noticed there are many steps to be taken before it gets to that stage <e> <s> with this explanation i hope as i said earlier that the noble lord lord jacques will not press this amendment <e>", "<cs> there is no muddle in our minds <e> <s> the government agree that agricultural co-operatives certainly have a valuable role to play and entirely accept that they can and do make significant contributions to increasing standards and increasing efficiency <e> <s> we would not wish this bill to discourage or undermine such desirable aims <e> <s> on the other hand co-operatives like any other enterprise may seek where they have a strong market position to abuse that position by anti-competitive behaviour <e> <s> if they were to do so i am sure we would all agree that such anti-competitive behaviour should be within the scope of this bill <e>", "<cs> it certainly will be <e>", "<cs> i entirely accept what has been said by the noble lord lord wallace and the noble baroness lady seear that everybody ought to have the right to approach the director general with their representations <e> <s> indeed they do <e> <s> under the bill as drafted the director general is entirely free to take any representations into account when <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord aware that the director general is a scotsman and probably wears a kilt <e>", "<cs> we have some sympathy with the underlying purpose of this amendment that firms which are investigated should be given a fair hearing <e> <s> but it should be remembered that the <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to say i am not very happy with this one either <e>

by the director general and that as the noble lord lord ponsonby said earlier is not desirable in the context of this quick procedure <e> <s> secondly i think that the arrangements if we agreed to this amendment would seem to be to those who were subject to an investigation a sort of court of appeal where the secretary of state would be obliged to reconsider almost every decision made by the director general to institute an investigation <e> <s> that is not the intention <e> <s> it is intended only that the secretary of state should use his powers in a very narrow range of cases principally where the director general proposed to investigate matters which were properly a matter of government policy <e>", "<cs> i suppose i had better reply to what the noble lord has said but i do not think it will have persuaded your lordships <e> <s> the fact is that an investigation could start within the two-week period allowed for the secretary of state to exercise his veto and in general cases it will because most of the investigations decided upon by the director general will under no stretch of the imagination be candidates for the secretary of states veto <e> <s> therefore the director general will of course proceed right away <e> <s> where the director general apprehends that there is a possibility of the secretary of state seeking to exercise his veto he will undoubtedly as he is required to do under the bill have informed the secretary of state in advance of his intention to carry out the investigation and the secretary of state will no doubt have made up his mind whether or not to exercise the veto <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> once the secretary of state has heard formally of the director generals decision to institute an investigation he will be able to make up his mind right away if he needs to whether or not to exercise the veto <e>", "<cs> i have a great deal of sympathy with the amendment or the series of amendments proposed by my noble friend <e> <s> however i think that the formal consultation procedures which my noble friend seeks to introduce are rather cumbersome and i hope your lordships will agree unnecessary <e> <s> the secretary of state will certainly wish to consult the relevant minister who might well be the minister of transport about the sort of matters in which my noble friend takes such an interest before using any of his powers under the bill in respect of the matters for which that minister had direct responsibilities <e> <s> this would be in complete accordance with the normal principles of collective responsibility and that i think removes the need for a formal procedure <e> <s> i hope that that explanation will persude my noble friend that the sort of procedures which he desires will in fact take place and that therefore he will not press his amendment <e>", "<cs> collective responsibility is a very important matter <e> <s> every minister in every government is responsible equally with his colleagues for every measure put forward by that government and therefore of course insists that he is consulted on proposals that affect his department <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness will accept and indeed my noble friend behind me will accept that there is a good deal of formality in the consultations that take place between ministers <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness will accept what i have said on this occasion <e>", "<cs> i can assure my noble friend that the effect of the paragraph as presently drafted is quite clear and reflects the governments intentions in this matter <e> <s> although the director generals powers will enable him to request documents from persons who are not the subject of an investigation such documents must relate to matters relevant to the particular investigation <e> <s> there is no question of these powers being used to obtain documents which have no bearing on the investigation <e> <s> in the event of any dispute the courts would have to determine the relevance of a particular document <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will agree that to give the type of powers that would be created if we were to agree to his amendment would be undesirable <e> <s> they would enable the director general to ask for almost any document under the sun from people who were not connected with the investigation <e> <s> i really do not think that that is the right way to proceed and i hope my noble friend will not press his amendment <e>", "<cs> i agree that the powers in paragraph <e>", "<cs> i should prefer not to follow that course <e> <s> under the bill as drafted the director general is required where he has found an anticompetitive practice to state with reasons whether he considers it is appropriate for him to make a reference to the corn-mission <e> <s> the purpose of the director generals preliminary and relatively informal investigation is to establish to his own satisfaction whether and why there is an anti-competitive practice <e> <s> he is not equipped nor is it his role to assess the public interest <e> <s> that is for the commission <e> <s> nevertheless it will be helpful to consumers to industry both the investigated firm and those who may be affected by its practices to know why the director general thinks it appropriate or otherwise to make a reference to the commission <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that i have not persuaded my noble friend in this matter <e> <s> if i may i should like to make one further point <e> <s> there is no obligation upon a company to accept the <e>", "<cs> i think that for example the question of costs of proceedings before the monopolies and mergers commission is the subject of amendments which we shall be considering later on <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend would like to raise that matter then <e>", "<cs> it is an important aspect of the bill that a report should be published to explain the director generals findings as to whether a practice is anticompetitive <e> <s> i want to emphasise that point anti-competitive that does not necessarily mean for or against the public interest <e> <s> without the publication of reports on investigations people will not be aware of the reasons for the director generals views which may contain important clarification about the circumstances in which anti-competitive practices arise <e> <s> if no report were published quite unjustified inferences might be drawn from the bare fact that a practice had been discontinued and those affected by the practice or those who might be considering engaging in similar practices would not have the opportunity of seeing for themselves the director generals conclusions <e> <s> it is also an important discipline on the director general that his conclusions and arguments should be open to public scrutiny <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble baroness was not in her place when we had our discussion on clause where we went into that particular point in great detail <e> <s> anti-competitive means discouraging to competition <e> <s> i hope that is clearer to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> i shall consider that point <e> <s> i think it is quite a reasonable one <e> <s> the only danger i see is that a bowdlerised report is always the subject of intense detective work by those who receive it to see if by reading between the lines they can discover to whom it actually refers <e> <s> if there were no clear indication in the report as to who it referred to one might have it wrongly ascribed to some company which was in no way involved <e> <s> i shall consider the point and see whether the difficulties can be overcome <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede is expressing an oft-expressed fear if i may put it that way from the benches opposite <e> <s> in certain areas it would conflict with community obligations for the government to exercise unilateral control this is a <e>", "<cs> this amendment raises an issue which was exhaustively and extensively discussed in the other place <e> <s> the central question is whether there should be a stronger deterrent against failure to comply with an undertaking given to the director general following a preliminary investigation <e> <s> the government believe and it has been accepted by the other place that the bill as it stands strikes the right balance in this respect <e> <s> if an undertaking is broken the case can quickly be referred to the monopolies and mergers commission for a full investigation and i do not think any firm will wish to bring an investigation upon itself in a light or casual manner <e> <s> we believe that to go even further than that and to introduce specific penalties for the breach of an undertaking would act as a positive disincentive to the offering of the undertaking in the first place <e> <s> apart from the general principle involved the particular amendment proposed raises some objections <e>", "<cs> i suppose that in the short term they would wish to avoid it but the noble baroness will recall that earlier we discussed the question of public interest and a firm while agreeing that a practice is anti-competitive may well believe that it is in the public interest and that it will be found to be so by the monopolies and mergers commission in due course <e> <s> for that reason i do not think <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness decides what to do with her amendment may i say that i think her objection is a second reading objection she objects to the very philosophy of the policy that we have advanced to contain anti-competitive practices <e> <s> the right logical progression from what she is suggesting is the kind of legislation that exists elsewhere in which a large number of practices are specifically prohibited and there are penalties laid down for those who undertake those practices <e> <s> that is not the course that we have chosen to follow <e> <s> we have chosen a course described in the bill whereby the director general can consider these matters reach his conclusions and accept undertakings but at that stage the firm has not broken the law <e> <s> i hope the noble baroness will <e>", "<cs> i do not have in front of me the report to which the noble lord has referred but i believe that the procedures and safeguards already incorporated into the bill make this amendment unnecessary <e> <s> no case will go before the commission unless the <e>", "<cs> the amendment on the marshalled list is not concerned simply with the question of costs <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon briefly referred to this in his closing sentences it says and i am reading now from the marshalled list <e>", "<cs> i said that they would be unreasonable in the minds of those referred <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede addresses us or the noble lord lord jacques decides what to do with his amendment may i remind your lordships that the price commision act as it now is in which lord jacques and lord wallace of coslany took notable part when it went through this house did not provide for costs incurred by firms of inquiries by that commission to be recovered by the commission or by anyone else <e> <s> we shall bear that in mind when considering this matter <e>", "<cs> i have undertaken to look at this matter again <e> <s> i must say that i do so with an open mind but without too much hope <e> <s> i think that the arguments which i deployed in respect of the amendment of the noble lord lord jacques are broadly the same as those i would deploy in respect of the amendment proposed by my noble friend lady hornsby-smith <e> <s> i believe that this amendment was also discussed in another place and if i have my information correct i think the amendment was withdrawn in the light of the assurances that were given <e> <s> i am happy to think that my noble friend lady hornsby-smith will feel able to do the same as will the noble lord lord jacques on his amendment now before the committee <e>", "<cs> i hope that the members of the committee are sitting comfortably because we agree in principle to this amendment <e> <s> i understand my noble friends concern that art order made following a report on a competition reference should not extend to a course of conduct which was different in form from that specified in the report and we are therefore prepared to accept his amendment in principle <e> <s> i am advised that the amendment as drafted is however slightly defective <e> <s> but if my noble friend is prepared to withdraw his amendment now i will give him an undertaking that a government amendment will be tabled at report stage to achieve the desired effect <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might be allowed to deal with the general points <e>", "<cs> that was a most interesting thought <e> <s> at first sight although i shall have to think about it i would not have thought that it involves any restriction of competition and indeed i am not sure that many of us will be in the most receptive mood towards advertising when we have just had our electricity bill <e> <s> as one who has night storage heaters i can say that is certainly the case so far as i am concerned <e> <s> however it is for the director general of fair trading to consider whether any restriction of competition is involved and i will draw the noble lords remarks to his attention <e>", "<cs> no i am afraid not <e> <s> i remain content with what i said about clause <e>", "<cs> i am afraid it would be impracticable for the secretary of state to give the notice required by my noble friends amendment <e> <s> an investigation might well involve a whole multitude of manufacturers suppliers of services or distributors and it would not be realistic to expect all these parties to receive notice of the proposed investigation <e> <s> if having announced his intention to launch an investigation under clause the secretary of state became convinced through representations received that his original decision needed to be modified it would be open to him to revoke or vary the investigation under clause <e> <s> in any case it is important to remember that the powers under clause are to be used only exceptionally <e> <s> there is therefore no question of investigations under this provision imposing major burdens on industry or commerce <e> <s> in the light of that last point particularly i hope that my noble friend will see fit not to press his amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord i am almost inclined to call him my noble friend after all these exchanges has made an appeal for simplified drafting in legislation which we have heard many times in this chamber <e> <s> his appeal will be welcomed by everyone and particularly i am sure by parliamentary counsel who will take careful note of what the noble lord has said <e> <s> the present text of clause however we think makes absolutely clear the governments intention and for that reason i believe the amendment is unnecessary and i hope the noble lord will not press it <e>", "<cs> i think that my noble friend lord trenchard really deployed the major arguments against this amendment and frankly i have precious little to add to what he has said <e> <s> may i just say this that because all investiga <e>", "<cs> i shall try to follow the fine example of the noble lord and speak very briefly <e> <s> the purpose of these amendments is we think totally at variance with the underlying intention of clause <e> <s> the aim of investigations made under the clause is to explore the circumstances behind a particular price issue of major public concern and to produce a public report on the facts <e> <s> it is not the purpose of a price investigation to replace the mechanism of competition <e> <s> if there is effective competition then there should be no need to restrict prices and that is a point which i think my noble friend lord trenchard has made a number of times already this evening <e> <s> if a price investigation reveals evidence that a price is unjustified the appropriate follow-up action is through the use of competition legislation for example under <e>", "<cs> i am conscious of the fact that we have accepted only one amendment this evening <e> <s> although i will not reveal what is in my brief for the rest of the evening i am afraid that i cannot add to that small tally with this one <e> <s> i can however assure the committee that where matters of fact are concerned the regular practice of the commission is to check all factual material concerning companies with the companies themselves <e> <s> this procedure will be followed also in investigations under the bill <e> <s> the director general will follow a similar procedure in relation to his preliminary investigations and report <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to disappoint my noble friend but i am afraid that i cannot do so <e> <s> as i said earlier the sort of procedure proposed by my noble friend is akin to getting a sneak preview of the judgment in a court of law <e> <s> that is not i think the sort of proposal that ought to commend itself to your lordships <e> <s> to pick up a point made by my noble friend lord de la warr may i read from the amendment tabled by my noble friend lord mottistone <e> <s> he says in the second sentence <e>", "<cs> i said right at the outset of my remarks that the director general and indeed the commission will take every opportunity during the course of their investigations to make sure that the facts which they are relying upon are accurate <e> <s> i am afraid i cannot give my noble friend any undertaking to consider this matter further before the next stage <e>", "<cs> i am reluctant to mislead my noble friend <e> <s> the fact is that his amendment goes further than asking for a discussion of the mere facts <e> <s> his amendment says both of the detail and of the general sense of the report and that really goes a good deal wider than the effect of the arguments my noble friend has deployed <e> <s> i said earlier and i repeat that where matters of fact are concerned the regular practice of the commission is to check all factual material concerning companies with the companies themselves and this procedure will be followed by the director in his investigations under this bill <e> <s> if my noble friend insists that i think about it again i will do so with little hope that i shall reach any different conclusion <e>", "<cs> i am aware that is what my noble friend has asked for and i am afraid i cannot agree to it <e>", "<cs> i will look at it again but i am not prepared to agree to it on the terms defined in the amendment <e>", "<cs> i really do not think i can go any further <e> <s> the noble lord keeps on pressing me but i think i have made the point quite clearly <e> <s> i will think about what i have said and maybe i will change my mind but i am very unlikely i think to do that <e> <s> i am prepared to think about it but without any commitment at all that i will reach any different conclusion <e>", "<cs> i do not think it would be helpful to require and that is the operative word the director general to provide information about courses of conduct which he considers anti-competitive <e> <s> this would starkly conflict with the flexibility which is at the heart of the legislation <e>", "<cs> i do not think that there is such a thing as a non-comprehensive announcement in this context <e> <s> anything that the director general says will be taken as written on tablets of stone and i think that that is wholly undesirable <e> <s> we developed this point very fully indeed when the noble lord lord jacques moved his amendment <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will now be content <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord jacques did not persist with his proposal for a comprehensive list <e> <s> some guidelines were all he was asking for <e> <s> what we said was that the director general will record in his annual report the outcome of investigations that he has made during the year <e> <s> i think that that will be sufficient guidance for those who are seeking guidance in this matter <e> <s> may i say again that this is the third debate at least this evening we have had on this subject <e> <s> your lordships may think that we have now gone round and round this topic and ought to leave it for another one <e>", "<cs> the noble lord disclaims all parentage as far as the noble lord lord jacques is concerned with <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way again <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> the noble lord lord airedale is asking for the director general to give information as to those courses not in the singular but the plural <e> <s> in any event the noble lord lord jacques ended up asking for guidelines which is a different thing from a code of conduct or a code of practice <e> <s> may i say again that i think that what the noble lord is now proposing is very much in line with what the noble lord lord jacques was finally proposing <e>", "<cs> we have considerable sympathy with the object behind the noble lords new clause and new schedule <e> <s> there appears to have been a fairly general assumption until relatively recently that agreements relating solely to copyright were completely outside the restrictive trade practices legislation <e> <s> however as the noble lord has said some doubt has been cast on this assumption specifically in the case of exclusive copyright licences <e> <s> it is unlikely that all such licences are liable to registration but it appears that they may be registrable where two or more parties carrying on business accept relevant restrictions within the definitions of the act <e>", "<cs> my lords i have nothing to add to the answer i gave to my noble friend lord lucas of chilworth on th february last <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly the case that airlines earn more revenue on some routes than on others and i suppose therefore following from that one would say that some routes subsidise others <e> <s> as a result of government policy in this area we have for example been able to hold the economy fares to scandinavia apart from some modest fuel-related increases we have introduced some very low-priced economy fares on those routes discussions are taking place with the greek and italian governments on the same matter and we have unilaterally contained fare increases to those countries <e> <s> as a result of pressure by the government on the spanish aeronautical authorities new excursion fares have been introduced for some spanish destinations <e>", "<cs> my lords the government asked the commission to initiate consultations under the price clause of the communitys agreement with romania under the multifibre arrangement on th december <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of what my noble friend has said that these imports have caused some difficulties <e> <s> i cannot predict precisely how long the commissions inquiries into this matter will take but we have asked them to deal with it urgently <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the price of suits but all the same i am not sure whether your lordships would be jumping to buy these suits which are imported at about each <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i cannot see into the mind of the romanian government in this matter but what the noble viscount says may well be right <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is a matter for my noble friend the leader of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords this is indeed a serious matter but the action must be taken through the machinery of the european community <e>", "<cs> my lords i see no criticism in the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure my noble friend is right <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first say how much i enjoyed and appreciated the very remarkable maiden speech of the noble baroness lady jeger <e> <s> we do not often hear maiden speeches like that or any other speeches for that matter and i think that the noble baroness is a very fine addition to your lordships house <e> <s> i hope that we shall hear her again soon and often <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government have on a number of occasions stated their opposition to the boycott and the willingness of our posts overseas and the department of trade to give all the help and advice they can to british exporters <e> <s> the boycott has been the subject of a searching examination by a select committee of this house and the government and their predecessor have responded as positively as they have felt able to its recommendations <e> <s> no further action is contemplated at least for the present <e>", "<cs> dealing first with the dutch position my lords we are <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i cannot answer for what happens in the dutch parliament <e> <s> however i can tell the noble lord that so far it is not a question of legislation but a question of resolutions and as your lordships will know that is a very different matter <e> <s> on the question of our exports to israel i sought to make the point that despite the apparent handicaps that our exporters to that country are placed under we have none the less succeeded in increasing our exports to them <e>", "<cs> the committee made a large number of recommendations my lords as the noble lord will know <e> <s> i should need notice to count up which ones we have adopted but he will remember <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will no doubt be aware that in his opening statement made on th february in hamburg the leader of the british delegation the noble lord lord todd referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i can certainly give the undertaking that my noble friend asked for in his first supplementary question <e> <s> with regard to his second supplementary question i think that we need to consider these meetings on a case by case basis but on this occasion at least we came to the view that participation was more likely to be effective than deciding not to go <e>", "<cs> i would not agree with that view my lords <e> <s> i think that the soviet union regard the olympic games <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord for that helpful intervention <e> <s> may i add that the meeting at hamburg was not an inter-governmental meeting but a meeting of scientists from the various countries <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i certainly agree with that <e> <s> the scientific importance of the meeting at hamburg in the eyes of the soviets at least may perhaps best be judged by the fact that of their mission of only four were scientists <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that that is another wholly unacceptable aspect of soviet policy in this matter <e> <s> the noble lord raised the question of the four psychiatrists which arose the other week <e> <s> we have seen the reports to which the noble lord then referred but so far we have no further information on them <e>", "<cs> exchanges of what my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i dealt with exchanges of scientific knowledge when i answered the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts just now <e> <s> certainly genuine exchanges of useful scientific information particularly for peaceful purposes are to be encouraged <e>", "<cs> no my lords there is no parallel between the situation in uganda and that in afghanistan <e> <s> the question of offering advice to british athletes does not arise <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is misinformed <e> <s> the invasion it was not an invasion <e> <s> the arrival <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked for that <e> <s> the arrival of tanzanian troops in uganda was by all accounts very much approved of by the ugandan people at the time <e> <s> i do not think that the same could be said for the afghans <e>", "<cs> my lords so i believe <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly the case that the ugandans before the tanzanian troops entered uganda had attacked tanzania <e> <s> as for the disorder that reigned in uganda prior to that time i think that the noble lord is quite right <e>", "<cs> my lords if the purpose of that lengthy supplementary question is to suggest that the russian invasion of afghanistan was a response to an afghan invasion of russia that assertion is absurd <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the precise numbers of <e>", "<cs> not that i have heard of my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is right that the invasion of afghanistan threatens the security of the whole world <e> <s> the same cannot he said of the troops now in uganda <e>", "<cs> my lords that is rather another matter <e> <s> our view is that if the olympic games were to continue in moscow it would provide a propaganda <e>", "<cs> my lords that is another question but we have taken note of what president nyrere said <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> in present circumstances such a proposal would be one-sided in its application and unverifiable <e> <s> it would undermine the security of the united kingdom and her allies and would do nothing to stabilise the current european military situation <e>", "<cs> my lords the great bulk of the western nuclear deterrent apart of course from the maritime submarines and the like is based in europe <e> <s> does the noble lord really think it right that we should agree to the complete removal of all those nuclear forces while the russians make no similar proposal with regard to their nuclear forces just the other side of the iron curtain <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords <e> <s> i am very willing to respond to that <e> <s> such zones can make a positive contribution to international and regional security to the cause of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and the reduction of the risk of nuclear war but they must be properly conceived <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> it was not a british proposal <e> <s> so far it is only a proposal anyway <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand what the noble lord says but i can only repeat that we have to judge this proposal as we see it in relation to our own security <e>", "<cs> no not without notice my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second

understood perhaps i may say just a few words <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that i am rather disappointed that the noble lord lord airedale made that intervention because i was proposing to deal with this amendment and with amendment no <e> <s> in the same way <e> <s> but of course the noble lord is perfectly entitled to move his amendment and to say whatever he thinks <e> <s> i am now going to speak quite comprehensively on this amendment no <e> <s> and the noble lord may find himself satisfied when i sit down <e> <s> who can say <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope your lordships will bear with

obliged to pursue the matter <e> <s> our objections to the principle of both <e>", "<cs> no my lords i think not <e> <s> the fact is that for a company to be in a position where they must stop the practice that practice has to be found to be both anti-competitive and against the public interest by the mmc <e> <s> if companies wish voluntarily to give undertakings before that stage is reached they are free to do so and the bill provides for that <e> <s> but it is not true to say that the director general can order the company to give up a practice because the company can insist and no doubt many will that their case should be taken before the mmc <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord and to the house <e> <s> the mmc is the monopolies and mergers commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord jacques is hoping for me to say something more and with the leave of the house i should like to do so <e> <s> i am not sure how i would describe the information that is to be published by the director general if it is not to be by guidance notes <e> <s> i fancy that that is just what it would be <e>", "<cs> my lords we have given considerable thought to this matter since it was raised by my noble friend in committee <e> <s> we accept and wish to encourage the co-operative principle in agriculture fisheries and forestry and would not wish action under the bill to undermine that encouragement <e> <s> we do not regard it as desirable for those courses of conduct pursued by agricultural cooperatives and their members which constitute and do no more than constitute the provision by co-operatives of services to their members and the carrying out by members of their commitments to trade with or through their co-operatives to be investigated under the bill <e> <s> we therefore intend to take the opportunity under clause to exempt these aspects of agricultural co-operatives from the definition of anti-competitive practices which may be investigated under the bill <e> <s> that would leave it open however for conduct of a kind which was genuinely anti-competitive and potentially undesirable which represented an abuse of a strong market position to be considered under the bill <e> <s> therefore i hope that my noble friend will feel able to withdraw his amendment in the light of that assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to say yes i can give that assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for intervening yet again because this is a report stage <e> <s> the answer is that it will not be an amendment to the bill it will be an order made under the bill and i am afraid i cannot produce that for my noble friends inspection at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for speaking yet again <e> <s> i am speaking without a note but my recollection is that these orders are not subject to either negative or affirmative resolution procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords the point made in this amendment is i think very similar indeed to that being made in amendment no <e> <s> which follows and which the noble lord lord wallace of coslany and his friends are moving <e> <s>

has been given by the director general namely that he would always give the firms concerned an opportunity to see the factual parts of his report before it was finalised and published <e> <s> i hope that in the light of that assurance my noble friend as he foreshadowed will not press his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend said we discussed this matter previously but may i say that the onus is entirely on the firm to decide whether to offer an undertaking and it is important that the procedure should not be used as a means of prevarication or delay by firms <e> <s> even where both the director general and the firm may consider that a negotiation is likely to succeed if it is allowed say a further eight weeks or weeks beyond the eight weeks originally specified there can be no certainty that this will prove to be the case even where the firm is not deliberately trying to use the procedure as a means of delaying action <e> <s> we are most anxious that it should not be used as an excuse for delay and we regard weeks as the absolute limit if the procedure is not to lose credibility <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will not press his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to seem inflexible in these matters <e> <s> i am speaking to amendment no <e> <s> although i recognise that my noble friend referred also to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> if my noble friend was speaking to amendment no <e> <s> only i might have been better able to accommodate him but as it is i am prepared to give an undertaking to consider this matter further and to consult him before the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords since our debate in committee on a very similar amendment to this one we have looked at this matter again as i undertook <e> <s> but i have to tell the house that the amendment remains unacceptable <e> <s> the report of the council on tribunals on the <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said during the committee stage when we were considering as the noble baroness reminded us a similar amendment to this the government would of course consider very carefully any representations from consumer bodies about a nationalised industrys or other public bodys costs and efficiency standard of service or possible abuse of a monopoly situation <e> <s> such representations are most likely to raise questions which are probably already covered by the three sub-paragraphs in clause or by the earlier provisions of the bill and in the circumstances i hope the noble baroness will not wish to press her amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords several noble lords and noble baronesses have said that they feel strongly on this amendment <e> <s> i do too <e> <s> the agricultural marketing boards have been included in clause because of their monopoly position under statute in which respect they are little different from many of the other bodies covered by subsection <e> <s> nevertheless in view of the special position of the ministers for agriculture in relation to agricultural marketing boards under the agricultural marketing act the government have tabled amendments to clause which we shall be able to discuss later <e> <s> these will have the effect of requiring the secretary of state formally to consult the relevant agricultural minister before a board is referred to the commission under clause <e> <s> the amendments also require similar consultation about the use of the secretary of states power of veto under the earlier clauses of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has said some of these boards have been in being for a good number of years and by and large they have not been subjected to the sort of scrutiny which we are now providing for where the ministers concerned feel that the investigation is appropriate <e> <s> i would turn the question about the noble lord asked me whether we have any positive evidence that these boards are in need of audit <e> <s> no i have not <e> <s> neither has the noble lord any evidence that they are perfect <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be much in sympathy with the noble lords intention to simplify the wording in clause but i am sorry to say that i am advised that the amendment is defective because as it stands it refers to a direction made under subsection <e> <s> but subsection is concerned only with a variation or revocation of a direction subsection makes clear that a direction in subsection has an identity separate from both a variation and a revocation and i hope therefore that the noble lord will not press the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to repeat to make it absolutely clear that it has been the monopolies and mergers commission practice under the fair trading act to check the accuracy of the factual material which may be used in their reports with the persons concerned <e> <s> this is a long-established practice which works well even though it is not written into the fair trading act <e> <s> we have not received representations that this practice has given rise to any problems in the past <e> <s> i can assure the house once more that the factual material in reports under this bill will be checked with the firms concerned both by the monopolies and mergers commission and by the director general <e> <s> reports into prices under clause do raise rather different issues since they could he extremely general but i am sure that the director general will do whatever seems necessary to check the factual accuracy of reports under clause <e> <s> i hope this meets the point my noble friend has put and that these assurances will enable him to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure your lordships are again grateful to the noble lord lord airedale for his attempts to ensure the maximum clarity in our legislation but i am afraid i am advised that what he seeks with this amendment is already provided by <e>", "<cs> that is so my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the conclusions of the hamburg scientific forum of the csce take the form of a short general report with annexes on the technical subjects dealt with at the forum <e> <s> the report includes <e>", "<cs> my lords there were indeed a number of useful technical conclusions made at the forum which as i have said were annexed to the report <e> <s> as for future meetings which the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords that would be for my noble friend lord brockway to explain <e>", "<cs> yes of course my lords and the delegates at the conference used this opportunity to make their views on these matters known to their soviet counterparts <e>", "<cs> my lords it is too early to say whether there will be any concrete results of the kind to which the noble lord refers but as i have said the delegates to that conference who were british scientists and not british government delegates lost no opportunity to impress their views upon the soviet delegates some of whom were scientists <e>", "<cs> my lords we will certainly support any proposal of that nature which in our view is effective and worthwhile <e> <s> as for the conclusions of the forum generally there were nationalities represented at that forum and a considerable degree of compromise was necessary to achieve the result that was achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> that is certainly our view <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments of the united states and the netherlands have publicly supported a boycott of the olympic games in moscow while a number of other nato countries including the federal republic of germany norway and luxembourg have expressed reservations about their athletes taking part <e> <s> as regards sporting bodies in the united kingdom an increasing number of them seem to be having doubts about the wisdom of going to moscow <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i certainly recognise the patriotism of mr watts <e> <s> as for the corporate view if that is the right expression of the various sporting bodies they really have not come to a corporate view yet <e> <s> we very much welcome the decision of the british olympic association to defer responding to the invitation from the moscow organising committee until a later date that is consistent with the attitude being adopted by other western national olympic committees and indeed with the advice given to the association by the government <e> <s> as for the financial implications of my noble friends supplementary questions i cannot give any assurances of particular financial support at this moment <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly the whole world is recognising the importance and merit of the proposals advanced by my noble friend but that does not detract from our view that to go to moscow in the present circumstances would be wholly unacceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not true <e> <s> we are certainly concerned with actions and it is actions that we are trying to achieve in this matter not mere words <e> <s> as for the cost of games this year or next i am not in a position to answer that question without notice <e>", "<cs> that is a very pertinent question my lords <e>", "<cs> indeed not my lords <e> <s> the question on the order paper of course relates to the olympic games <e> <s> our attitude is closely in line with that of the united states we strongly advise our athletes and indeed our spectators not to go <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that the position is just as my noble friend describes <e> <s> as i understand it the decision of the british olympic association was to postpone replying to their invitation <e> <s> we very much hope that the boa will in the end accept the governments further advice not to go to moscow and will refuse the invitation <e>", "<cs> my lords a russian withdrawal from afghanistan if it were to take place following acceptance of my noble friends proposals or any other would clearly significantly alter the position but as the noble lord has said that would not necessarily of itself mean that we would withdraw our objections to the olympic games in moscow <e>", "<cs> my lords i am greatly obliged to the noble lord for that intervention <e> <s> it precisely confirms our view <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think there is a contradiction at all <e> <s> certainly the russian way of behaving including the ways referred to by the noble lord lord avebury were with us long before afghanistan but i think the noble lord underestimates the enormity of what the soviets have done in afghanistan <e> <s> they have invaded a neighbouring unaligned and sovereign nation <e>", "<cs> my lords if the russians withdraw from afghanistan that will of course fundamentally change the situation but i would not want in advance to have to say that if they did that without any reference to whatever else they might do between now and then we would automatically lift our objection <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord for a slip of memory <e> <s> yes indeed we do give the same advice to the media and to spectators <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have just said we hope spectators and visitors will take note of our advice not to go <e>", "<cs> my lords i readily acknowledge the passionate views of my noble friend in this matter and i understand what motivates thembut the fact is none the less that if the games are to continue in moscow as planned it will be a propaganda coup and triumph of monumental proportions for the russians <e>", "<cs> my lords may i apologise briefly for the length and complexity of this answer but it is an important matter so i hope your lordships will bear with me <e> <s> avgas l differs from four-star motor fuel by virtue <e>", "<cs> my lords we do recognise that there is a world problem certainly a european problem and an acute problem indeed in some parts of the world regarding this particular product <e> <s> the oil companies are urgently considering whether they can adjust the manufacture of motor spirit in such a way that it could be used safely in small aircraft engines <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give the noble lord the answer on the octane numbers <e> <s> four-star motor spirit has an octane rating of not less than research octane number whereas l avgas has a rating of not less than octane performance octane number weak mixture and not less than performance octane number rich mixture <e> <s> i am afraid i have not got the vapour figures in front of me <e>", "<cs> my lords i do apologise to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords while

pilot achieving his licence in this country is required to undertake i believe at least twice the number of flying hours of his american counterpart <e>", "<cs> my lords officials of diplomatic missions in london together with their families are entitled to full or restricted diplomatic privileges and immunities <e> <s> a further are entitled to some privileges and immunities under the international organisations act mostly for official acts only <e>", "<cs> my lords the particular case to which my noble friend refers and i am obliged to her for giving me notice of her intention to raise it was an unhappy one indeed <e> <s> but i should tell the house and my noble friend that the prosecuting authorities decided that the evidence could not support a charge of causing death by reckless driving and at the inquest the coroner brought in an open verdict <e> <s> the police are still <e>", "<cs> last october my lords <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords <e> <s> the privileges which we accord to diplomats in london are in line with those accorded to our own diplomats in almost every country in the world <e> <s> they stem from the vienna convention on diplomatic relations of which was given effect in united kingdom law by the diplomatic privileges act <e>", "<cs> my lords it would not be true to say that there is widespread abuse of these arrangements <e> <s> there are a few well publicised abuses which we do our best to deal with <e> <s> however we could not unilaterally restrict the privileges of visiting diplomats without risking the genuine and very necessary privileges accorded to our diplomats overseas <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i can readily deal with that matter <e> <s> the compensation is not affected by diplomatic immunity <e> <s> diplomats like everyone else are required to have proper insurance arrangements and that is certainly the case with regard to the recent finnish incident <e>", "<cs> no my lordsi am afraid that i would not agree with that <e> <s> there are good reasons why that should be the case and that is why it is provided for in the agreements <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that that is the case but perhaps i can look into it if the noble baroness will draw my attention to a specific incident <e> <s> i can only repeat that if that were so it would arise from the agreements which we have entered into <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the opportunity to debate these two reports and once again your lordships are in debt to the select committee on the european communities under the chairmanship of the noble baroness for undertaking this study <e> <s> the committee has produced a number of notable reports in the past <e> <s> the government will want to take account of views expressed in this debate and of any conclusions that the select committee may reach on these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot hide from your lordships our regret that so far that seems to be the case <e> <s> however we have high hopes that the french will comply with the forthcoming judgments when and if we get them as i believe we shall and perhaps then this unhappy matter can be brought to a close <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a small detachment of tanzanian troops in the seychelles and a substantial tanzanian force in uganda <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the seychelles government do admire the tanzanian government <e>", "<cs> my lords the tanzanian troops in uganda are there by virtue of an agreement between the two governments <e>", "<cs> my lords the troops in the seychelles which are just a few hundred in number arrived in two parties <e> <s> the first party i think was in june last year and the second party was in october <e>", "<cs> my lords the responsibility for the costs of the tanzanian troops of course lies with the tanzanian government <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me to intervene think it is the case is it not <e> <s> that the cdc has access to many funds other than just government funds <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords it falls to me to thank the noble earl lord listowel for raising this matter this afternoon and of course to congratulate the noble lord lord chorley on his most enlightened and absorbing maiden speech which clearly as several noble lords have already said came from the depth of his own experience <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two important points here <e> <s> first our ability to receive goods from developing countries or anywhere else on a substantial scale depends of course upon the health of our own economy and that we are working to rectify <e> <s> the other important matter to which i have briefly referred is our resistance to clamouring calls for protection by british industries <e> <s> there are many applications to the government particularly through the european community machinery for protection from what are called imports from low-cost suppliers and these we have been able to resist to a very substantial extent <e> <s> i hope that that is helpful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords it really does not matter what we call itwe still have to find the money and that is the difficulty <e> <s> the aid programme which we inherited from our predecessors could not be sustained with the funds available to the government <e> <s> that was why we had to revise them <e> <s> my noble friend lord holderness delivered as he always does an illuminating and thought-provoking speech founded on his great experience and eminence in these matters <e> <s> it might be presumptive of me as well as time-consuming if i discussed in too much detail what my noble friend said but i shall certainly undertake to study it very carefully indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not have that information <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are not talking of like with like <e> <s> was referring to the raw figures if i may call them that of our aid programme which in the year i referred to was million net from the united kingdom that is to say the gross figure less the receipts from loan repayments and interest <e> <s> i compared that with a similar figure for the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no evidence to indicate that the operation of so-called cowboy aircraft is a widespread problem in the united kingdom <e> <s> the question derives i believe from the occasion at bristol airport on th october when a boeing struck a hedge and a number of approach lights as it took off <e> <s> the aircraft continued its flight to kuwait without further incident <e> <s> it arrived in the united kingdom on th august american-owned and registered and during its stay in this country was leased to a liechtenstein based company and reregistered under a zaire registration although there is some doubt as to the latter <e> <s> i am assured by the civil aviation authority which has the matter under investigation that it is an isolated incident and that it is not aware of any other such incident so far as the united kingdom is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot of course answer for the policing of the regulations by other states <e> <s> but i can say that we have no evidence to support the suggestion that this is a widespread hazard <e>", "<cs> my lords according to the latest available information countries have granted permanent residence to or more refugees from south east asia since <e> <s> a further countries have accepted smaller numbers <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot see from the list in front of me any country except the peoples republic of china which has accepted far more than any other country which has a communist rgime <e> <s> i might want to consider that more carefully but i cannot see any from the list <e> <s> as for the position of hong kong it is certainly true that they have played a quite remarkable role in this matter <e> <s> the latest figures i have are <e>", "<cs> my lords that intervention is as always most helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of the particular matter which my noble friend raises <e> <s> perhaps i can look into it and get in touch with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i would want to consider the implications of that supplementary <e>", "<cs> no my lords the noble earl has misunderstood what i said <e> <s> there are or so refugees in hong kong presently who are slowly but surely being found permament places around the world but the fact as i mentioned earlier that hong kong has accepted nearly refugees for permanent settlement is very satisfactory indeed <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is supposed to be making an intervention <e> <s> if he wants to make a speech perhaps he should wait his turn <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of amendment no <e> <s> and the other two amendments which follow it is to give the relevant minister as my noble friend has explained equal status with the secretary of state in relation to various functions in the bill <e> <s> the first amendment as my noble friend said requires the director general to give notice of investigations and references into anti-competitive practice by an agricultural marketing hoard to the relevant minister as well as the secretary of state <e> <s> there is no provision in the bill for that at present although it would be normal administrative practice for all concerned <e>", "<cs> my lord my noble and learned friend is right and i shall therefore confine my remarks to the first amendment <e> <s> i shall in due course ask your lordships to resist the second and third amendments in the name of my noble friend <e> <s> as for this amendment it is not positively objectionable on its own it would save the secretary of state for trade and his officials from having to inform the relevant agricultural minister and his officials of the fact that the director general has initiated an investigation <e> <s> it would place this task directly upon the director general <e> <s> the government are satisfied that clause would work adequately as it stands but if my noble friend feels that it is the task of parliament to define who should see every piece of paper then the government would have no particular objection if my noble friend decided to press his amendment <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor very rightly said that i should speak only to the first amendment in the name of my noble friend which i did but my noble friend lord stanley of alderley is now speaking to the others <e> <s> that is what it sounds like <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to deploy my full arguments on this amendment but the attitude of my noble friends clearly requires me to say a little more <e> <s> the bill as far as anti-competitive practices are concerned enables the director general to do certain things and the secretary of state to do certain other things <e> <s> we have said before that wherever it is appropriate the secretary of state will consult the appropriate sponsor department <e> <s> this applies as much to agricultural questions as to those involving industry commerce and local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords what is the noble lord debating <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of this amendment is to give the relevant minister the right to veto an investigation on his own initiative and by implication regardless of the views of the secretary of state for trade <e> <s> the doctrine of collective ministerial responsibility renders this amendment not only unnecessary but thoroughly objectionable <e> <s> this point emerges strongly from this amendment <e> <s> we have one government not a government for agriculture a government for industry and a government for the consumers <e> <s> the implication of the amendment is to enable one minister to exercise a power of veto where another minister would not be prepared to exercise that power <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the house to allow me to ask my noble friend whether the minister of agriculture is wholly <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already deployed broadly the same argument for the last two amendments and will now proceed further along the same line in connection with this amendment <e> <s> if noble lords think that this government or their predecessor would not follow the principle of collective ministerial responsibility in respect of agricultural marketing boards i must ask them to consider the implications of these doubts <e> <s> if collective ministerial responsibility does not operate as it should then the government would have to revise wholesale the legislation which they administer to ensure that every minister who has a legitimate and direct interest in a particular problem is entitled to be consulted or to act separately or jointly with the minister who has the prime responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i did answer my noble friend i am speaking i hope with the leave of the house when i spoke to an earlier amendment <e> <s> the circumstances are not quite the same <e> <s> probably i had better rest my case on that <e> <s> the circumstances are indeed different because the point at which the consultation takes place under the agricultural marketing act is different <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos would like me to answer that point why we have not done it for years the answer is that this bill is to promote competition and to regulate anti-competitive practices which are found to be against the public interest <e> <s> i could ask the noble lord why his government did not bring it in <e>", "<cs> my lords i have got my numbering out of order <e> <s> i apologise for this disorganisation which is due to the printing difficulties we suffered this morning with regard to the marshalled list <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> and are clearly consequential on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> they are technical amendments <e> <s> it is intended that clause of the bill should confer exemption from the restrictive practices legislation on all agreements relating solely to copyright whether such agreements relate to existing works or works yet to be be produced <e> <s> i am advised that there is some doubt whether paragraph of paragraph a actually achieves this object <e> <s> the amendment is designed to remove that uncertainty <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i want to assure the noble lord that the government sympathise with his aim of improving the clarity and intelligibility of legislation <e> <s> we recognise that the amendment is intended to help the layman and even perhaps the practising lawyer to avoid pitfalls in the interpretation of the bill <e> <s> i hope therefore that the noble lord will accept that we are not just being obstinate if we see difficulties in his proposal <e> <s> as he said his amendment is a slight variant on the earlier version that he put forward at an earlier stage <e> <s> i am afraid the change is not for the better <e> <s> the new wording of the amendment implies that clause of the bill qualifies the application of section of the fair trading act <e> <s> this is misleading since clause in fact makes a textual amendment to that section which applies without qualification <e> <s> the noble lords original wording was actually better <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e> <s> may i just make one observation <e> <s> i do not wish to go again into the detailed provisions of the bill <e> <s> with regard to the price commission there is one point which should be placed on record the government are aware that some disquiet <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend lord mottistone that the records of the price commission will be equally as unavailable to the mmc as they will be to the director general of fair trading except of course in accordance with the provisions which i mentioned <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will now agree that the bill should pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede explained this amendment falls into three parts and raises three important matters <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> i misunderstood what he said and i will come in a moment to the point that i now know he raised <e> <s> at vesting day it will be turned from a private to a public company new articles will be adopted its capital structure will be altered to accommodate whatever capital structure is thought appropriate for the successor company and the board members of british aerospace will he elected as its directors <e>", "<cs> i think anybody who deals with public information is subject to the official secrets act <e> <s> perhaps i can look into that point and if i am wrong i will let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> the amendment may well seek to avoid imposing a straitjacket upon british aerospace but i am afraid the fact is that that is what it does and that is what we think is wrong <e> <s> of course british aerospace is going to remain in the aerospace business <e> <s> if it were not we should not be troubling your lordships with this legislation <e> <s> i think i should rest my case on the assertion which i competently advance to your lordships that the provisions of the memorandum and articles which the noble lord wishes to circumscribe by his amendment are really best left to the shareholders of the new company as indeed was the case before british aerospace came into public ownership and that is the situation we now seek to restore <e> <s> it is indeed the situation with every other major and minor company in british industry and has served us well and will i believe continue to do so <e>", "<cs> the purpose and indeed the effect as the noble lord lord ponsonby said of this amendment is to prevent the secretary of state from disposing of any shares and i emphasiseany shares even one allotted to him as a consequence of vesting unless the disposal has been authorised by an affirmative resolution of each house of parliament <e> <s> the effect of the amendment is that the disposal of one share would as i understand it need affirmative resolution from both houses of parliament <e>", "<cs> i am glad for confirmation of that <e> <s> i knew it to be the case <e> <s> the noble lords intervention did not take us much further forward <e> <s> the fact that the government intend to sell shares is however well known indeed it is the very essence of the bill <e> <s> i think your lordships will therefore agree that there really is no need for any further parliamentary procedure simply to approve the fact of a disposal <e>", "<cs> before coming to the specific point put by the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede i should like to explain briefly the purpose of the powers in clause <e> <s> the clause empowers the secretary of state with treasury consent to make certain subsequent investment in the successor company <e> <s> i stress the wordcertainfor not all types of investment are permitted under this provision <e> <s> in broad terms the government under this statute will be able to advance finance when the purpose in so doing is to acquire either directly or indirectly equity in the successor company <e> <s> this limitation is explained quite simply by the purpose behind the clause <e> <s> it is that the government should have the means of maintaining a particular proportionate shareholding in the company for example a holding of over per cent <e> <s> in order to protect the foreign control article <e> <s> it is not the purpose that the government should be in a special position relative to the company as a general provider of funds <e> <s> that would be quite contrary to our repeated concern that it should be recognised that the government will not stand behind the successor company in the way they stand behind a nationalised industry <e> <s> the company will and must stand by its own <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that the appointment of nominees or the size of their shareholding are things which should appropriately be published in the <e>", "<cs> this amendment would prevent the operation of the downward ratchet mechanism provided for in clause <e> <s> i recognise that it is also intended to probe the governments intentions as to the size of their shareholding <e> <s> when the successor company ceases to be wholly owned by the government a target investment limit will have to be set at the level of the proportionate shareholding of the government at that time <e> <s> the purpose of the limit is to set a target level for the governments proportionate shareholding in the successor company which although it need not be maintained must not be exceeded <e> <s> we want to be able to retain a given proportionate shareholding if we wish to do so and in particular we must be able to retain a holding of over per cent <e> <s> in order to protect the foreign control article but we want it to be clear that the governments shareholding will not increase above a given level <e> <s> subsequent orders setting new limits may be made from time to time provided that each new order sets an investment limit lower than the one it replaces <e> <s> an order setting a limit can only be revoked by another order setting a lower limit and this means that some limit must always be in force <e>", "<cs> i do not think that is fair <e> <s> i have given a clear undertaking on this matter <e> <s> the same undertaking was given by my honourable friend mr butler in the other place <e> <s> the undertaking certainly binds this government <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord renton has raised a complex and difficult matter and i shall do my best to answer as fully as i can <e> <s> however i am afraid that i certainly cannot answer without consideration the last point he put to me about the residual spent provisions of the act <e>", "<cs> we entirely agree that all directors of the company should be citizens of the united kingdom and colonies <e> <s> provisions to this effect will be included in the articles of association of the successor company which as my noble friend said just now will be available to the house in draft before the report stage <e> <s> the government would be prepared to vote their shareholding if it was necessary to prevent any amendment to these provisions <e>", "<cs> the duty which this clause seeks to impose upon the successor company through its articles of association is a standard one imposed upon public corporations <e> <s> it is one by which british aerospace is bound by virtue of section of the aircraft and shipbuilding industries act <e> <s> i understand why the noble lord has moved this amendment but i believe that when i have described its effect he will see that it is a limited provision which will achieve little or nothing <e> <s> provisions in the articles imposed by the clause would require the successor company to consult relevant <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord wynne-jones said this new clause would provide that the articles of association of the successor company should include a provision requiring the company to formulate a corporate plan after consulting its trade unions <e> <s> it would therefore in effect impose upon the successor company a duty comparable to the one to which british aerospace is subject as a nationalised industry under section of the aircraft and shipbuilding industries act <e> <s> this approach is fundamentally opposed to the governments policy which is to vest british <e>", "<cs> i shall do my best to reply as quickly as the noble lord has moved the amendment <e> <s> to be perfectly honest when i read this amendment i thought that it probably qualified for the silly-amendment-of-the-week prize and i hope that your lordships will agree with me when i have quickly said a few words <e>", "<cs> i do not disagree with the principle that powers of the sort included in this new clause should be available to the government <e> <s> however they will be available in any case since we shall be able to provide assistance under section of the civil aviation act to encourage measures for the designing development and production of civil aircraft <e> <s> the new clause would therefore add nothing to the powers of the government since the successor company will be eligible for assistance under the act on the same basis as any other company <e> <s> in this respect it will differ from british aerospace which was debarred from receiving civil aviation act money by section of the aircraft and shipbuilding industries act <e> <s> section was included in the act as a substitute for the civil aviation act power to enable british aerospace to receive direct funding for civil aircraft projects in certain circumstances <e> <s> we

resulted in the destruction of the bridges was carried out not by helicopters but by fixed wing aircraft <e> <s> as for paying for bridge repairs we have said that we would do what we could and we have helped in the way that i have announced <e>", "<cs> my lords there have been a good few changes in that part of the world of late but perhaps the noble lord has not noticed <e>", "<cs> my lords

for this year will be million a very substantial figure having regard to our stretched resources <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure it is true that zambia suffered as a result of the firm stand which it has taken in the past few years <e> <s> that is why our aid programme has been so substantial <e>", "<cs> while there is no corresponding organisation in the united kingdom comparable work is carried out by a number of bodies <e> <s> for example the fisheries ministries are responsible for the management and conservation of fisheries and the protection of the marine environment from pollution <e>

that nearly years after the passing of the consular salaries and fees act of which introduced the general right to levy consular fees this principle has not yet been enshrined in law <e> <s> your lordships may also be surprised to learn that the authority to levy the fee for such services performed in foreign countries resides in the title of the functionary rather than in the service he performs and that at home the authority does not extend to northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i fancy that the only british consular fee that most of us are ever likely to be called upon to pay is

facilitate the united nations task of monitoring the cease-fire and protecting the border it will be established as soon as possible after the cease-fire <e>", "<cs> my lords the independence celebrations are a matter for mr mugabe and his ministers <e> <s> the important contribution of those many rhodesians who served alongside us in the last war was given appropriate recognition at the

the last war was no fewer than of whom more than were white males and -odd were africans <e> <s> i think however that the appropriate method to recognise that splendid service was what was done at the

<e> <s> first of all i think it was better addressed to one of the later amendments standing in his name i do not think it had too much to do with this amendment which relates to the percentage shareholding <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wynne-jones has once more told us of his fears for british aerospace limited and has also explained <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that the noble lord is speaking for the first time and i am perhaps stretching the indulgence of the house a little by intervening now but i really must tell him that he is quite mistaken in this view <e> <s> when we debated rhodesia first in this session of parliament on th july i said from this box quite clearly that we could not and would not recognise bishop muzorewas government at that time <e> <s>

away with that <e> <s> he is describing quite accurately i think the results of the war that so tragically ravaged rhodesia for all those years <e> <s> is he saying that the british government were responsible for that war <e> <s> and if it was so evil as indeed it was why then did the patriotic front not agree to a ceasefire at the beginning of the lancaster house conference as bishop muzorewa did <e>", "<cs> my lords it is customary on these occasions for those noble lords participating in a debate to rise and express their thanks to the peer who has asked the question <e> <s> i must confess that my own gratitude this evening is a bit stretched indeed it is with some considerable surprise that i find myself rising to answer the unstarred question of the noble lord lord hatch this evening <e> <s> first i am puzzled as to what additional information the noble lord imagines the government are able to give him <e> <s> secondly i cannot understand what useful purpose the noble lord thinks he is serving by making the mischievous and unfounded allegations which were contained in his speech <e> <s> of course he is entitled to express his opinion of government policies but as rhodesia moves to indepencence in conditions of peace and stability that only a few months ago seemed unattainable i am doubtful whether any useful purpose is served by a further raking over of

have by no means finished my remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i can tell the noble lord that all his criticisms are without foundation <e>", "<cs> my lords fuel-saving measures in the airline industry lie largely in the hands of the operators themselves by the choice of aircraft and by improvements in aircraft operating procedures <e> <s> the government and the civil aviation authority do what they can by trying to improve air traffic control services and shorten air routes <e>", "<cs> my lords the national air traffic service which is a joint service run by the civil aviation authority and the ministry of defence are very much aware of these matters and do what they can within the constraints of military requirements and other considerations to keep air routes to a minimum <e> <s> i can also say that the air traffic control authorities in europe for whom we have no responsibility are equally aware of these problems <e>", "<cs> my lords i have read the report to which i think the noble lord is referring but the noble lord and your lordships should not confuse on the one hand the amount of fuel consumed with on the other the amount of fuel carried <e> <s> the case to which the

friend lord barnby a moment ago we are hoping that we shall be able to achieve an arrangement after accession where there is some specific quantitative restriction upon portuguese textile imports into

propose to give although many of them have said that in principle they will be ready and willing to do so <e> <s> as for zimbabwe becoming a bastion of the free world i am not sure i would have chosen precisely those words but i certainly recognise and agree that the new nation will require substantial support in the years to come and the programme that we have announced indicates the importance we attach to this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with the noble baroness that we hope that zimbabwe will become a centre of stability in southern africa as she suggests <e> <s> i am not sure i quite understand the meaning of the words a bastion of the free world and that was why i hesitated before endorsing those words when expressed by my noble friend <e> <s> as for united kingdom

earlier we are not yet in a position to say precisely what the other commonwealth nations will be giving <e> <s> in any event it is not wholly <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of all the things that have gone before over so many years we certainly recognise that the new zimbabwe has a special claim upon our limited aid budget <e> <s> indeed we were able to go beyond that as my noble friend announced on th april and certain additional allocations were made to the aid budget specifically for zimbabwe <e> <s> however i can assure my noble friend that there is no question of an open-ended commitment <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no announcement yet from the eec on these matters but i had the pleasure of dining with m cheysson while i was in salisbury and lie was certainly keen to do what he could <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so i think that the noble baroness is mistaken <e> <s> mr mugabe is quite satisfied with the aid figure that we have allocated <e> <s> he expressed publicly his gratitude and satisfaction at what we have been able to do <e> <s> moreover the timing of the aid mission which has been criticised in some quarters has met with the zimbabwean governments full agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords those were not the words of the prime minister <e>", "<cs> my lords the survey referred to has not been published but it is a consultants analysis of the progress of metrication in the engineering sector of industry <e> <s> its conclusions are in line with what my noble friend lord trenchard said in the metrication debate on st january that the transition was half completed <e> <s> the governments policy remains to permit manufacturers to change over to metric working if and when they judge the time is right <e>", "<cs> my lords i am highly suspicious of costs said to accrue to so-called average companies <e> <s> i really do not know what an average company is <e> <s> but the fact of the matter is that the costs of metrication can be very substantial for example if it is necessary to retire a piece of machinery earlier than one would otherwise have done so and to replace it with a new machine at very considerable expense <e> <s> we think that it is right to leave it to individual companies to decide when it is in their best interests to change over to metric units <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that people have unjustified fears of the metric system <e> <s> we definitely think that it is a good thing for firms to move to the metric system of units but we do not want to dragoon them into doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that the cbi has asked for such a meeting but if it has i am sure that it will be given most sympathetic consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is mistaken there has been no retreat <e> <s> firms are still ready and able and certainly encouraged to proceed with metrication at the speed which suits them best <e> <s> as for what happens in schools although i understand that the metric system is the one primarily taught in schools children are certainly also given an exposure to the basic imperial units which still exist <e>", "<cs> my lords the costs which a firm incurs when it goes metric depend on the timing of those changes for example as i said earlier on the desirability of replacing a machine when it comes to the end of its useful life <e> <s> no doubt the americans were able to time their change-over accordingly <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness appears to misunderstand the basis upon which this government was elected to office <e> <s> we have stopped the practice of dragooning people into doing these things because we allow them to decide for themselves when it is best to do something <e> <s> as for the various assertions which guided mr whiteley in producing his report one of the persons of whom he inquired and on whom he relied replied for heavens sake get on with it i am getting old <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord seems to think that we have not decided to go metric <e> <s> as i have repeatedly said that is not the case we agree with the benefits of going metric but we are not prepared to order firms to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right and that is just what i have been saying <e>", "<cs> my lords the prevention of theft and pilferage from passengers baggage at heathrow airport is a matter for the airlines and the metropolitan police <e> <s> the need for additional measures must be judged against the fact that over the last four years there has been a substantial decline in the number of thefts reported at the airport while the number of arrests over the same period has shown a significant increase <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only emphasise what i said in my original answer that the number of thefts at heathrow has shown a substantial decline in recent years <e> <s> i shall quote some figures to support that <e> <s> in the total number of confirmed thefts was in it had dropped to <e> <s> in the same period the number of arrests rose from to and the number of passengers from million to million <e>", "<cs> my lords the banding of luggage is certainly one of the matters that has been considered <e> <s> indeed as the noble baroness has said it has been adopted for certain flights which are regarded as being particularly sensitive <e> <s> but the cost of doing that for all the flights has proved to be prohibitive <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly ask british airways to look at this matter again with regard to the wider range of flights that the noble baroness suggests but i cannot hold out much hope that the earlier difficulties will be overcome <e>", "<cs> my lords not without notice <e> <s> but i recall that many noble lords including in particular the noble baroness were pressing hard for us to keep the fares as low as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> in point of fact the percentage of baggage broken into or pilfered is about the same at most of the major international airports of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords that might pose certain difficulties but i shall draw what the noble lord has said to the attention of british airways <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can simply refer to a case which attracted some notoriety recently when the judge in question said that honest loaders at heathrow stood out like sore thumbs <e> <s> we think that the learned judge was misinformed on that point and i think the figures i have produced support that assertion <e> <s> i would say that the incidence of dishonest loaders is no greater than the incidence of dishonest passengers <e>", "<cs> my lords imports of uranium from namibia began only recently <e> <s> the contract between rossing uranium limited and british nuclear fuels limited approved by previous governments conflicts with none of our international obligations <e> <s> united nations decisions on the subject are not binding in international law <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to say that the noble lord is mistaken on almost every count <e> <s> the trade is not illegal <e> <s> there is no international obligation on us to prevent trade of this kind with namibia <e> <s> as for the so-called <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord started talking about taxes <e> <s> the question on the order paper is to do with the trade in uranium <e> <s> the security council resolutions in this matter are only mandatory when they are coupled with a finding under chapter of the un charter <e>", "<cs> my lords i hardly think that that question is directed to me <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no question of any contravention of international law in this matter <e> <s> the position is quite clear <e> <s> the resolutions which we are talking about are not binding upon members of the united nations <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the last point the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> we are doing what we can to push forward with the negotiations for a settlement in namibia <e> <s> as regards the present position to which the noble lord referred at the beginning of his remarks it is true that we regard south africas presence in namibia as unlawful but we are working towards a south african withdrawal and as i have said namibian independence <e>", "<cs> my lords the government cannot either confirm or deny these reports <e>", "<cs> my lords hesitate to give an assurance to inform your lordships or my noble friend of something like that because i foresee difficulties in actually producing the proof to which my noble friend referred <e> <s> however i shall bear what he says in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords that matter was referred to recently by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for defence and i should not want to go further than he did then <e>", "<cs> my lords i want first to pay tribute to the maiden speech of the noble lord lord ritchie of dundee which as other noble lords have said was a remarkable one <e> <s> i too hope that the noble lord will intervene again soon in the debates of your lordships house and do so regularly thereafter <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble and learned lord will allow me i will come to that in more detail later <e> <s> in the theatre nuclear field they have recently introduced new and highly sophisticated missiles and as i said nuclear capable aircraft of particular concern <e> <s> they are also continuing to modernise their shorter range nuclear weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords i can certainly assure the noble lord that the governments consideration of this matter will be carried out with the utmost care and depth <e> <s> i will also undertake that whatever undertakings were given in the other place and i do not have them in front of me will of course be honoured and respected <e> <s> however i do not think that the noble lord wants me to go into those details now <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not going to be pressed to give any more undertakings than were given in the other place on this matter <e> <s> in the last resort these decisions must be taken by the government and they will be <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged <e> <s> we are also continuing negotiations in geneva for a comprehensive test ban <e> <s> we want to secure a treaty that will help curb the development of new types of nuclear weapons without adversely affecting security and assist in strengthening generally the non-proliferation regime <e> <s> i am sorry to have to say that progress particularly on verification has been regrettably slow <e>", "<cs> my lords the only saving accruing to her majestys government as a result of this change is a modest reduction in the cost of utilities for example electricity <e> <s> unfortunately the cost of preparing this answer has now dissipated the saving <e>", "<cs> my lords frequent use hardly describes the use that was made of these facilities <e> <s> the club has recently been running at a net loss on account of a falling off in demand for its cooked meals and the committee therefore decided to withdraw facilities for these after st march last <e>", "<cs> my lords may i remind the house that this is a third reading debate and that unlike when we are in committee when we have more freedom we are therefore required to speak only once upon each amendment <e> <s> with the two substantive amendments in this group the one to clause and the new clause we return to a subject which has been discussed by your lordships on two previous occasions at least during the committee and report stages <e> <s> i believe it came up at second reading as well <e> <s> the noble lord lord wynne jones and i am sorry that he is not well and is unable to be with us moved a new clause on report similar to the one now before the house and on that occasion your lordships chose to reject the amendment <e> <s> i mention those two previous debates to make the point that your lordships have already devoted a not inconsiderable amount of time to the subject of these amendments and have expressed an opinion on the principle at issue <e>", "<cs> my lords during the report stage of the bill the noble lord lord ponsonby pressed my noble friend lord cullen to reconsider the wording of clause which provides that if the government shareholding at any time exceeds the target investment limit it shall be the duty of the secretary of state to dispose of the excess shares as soon after that time as is reasonably <e>", "<cs> my lords a few moments ago we passed the third reading of the british aerospace bill and i therefore now rise to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said on several occasions the government condemn all acts of terrorism including those mounted from lebanon against neighbouring countries <e> <s> the declaration of the rights of the child is not a binding legal instrument but exhortatory <e> <s> the question of violation does not therefore arise <e> <s> the chances of preventing terrorism from lebanon would be considerably increased if the lebanese government were enabled to exercise their authority throughout the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord misleads the house with those kind of supplementary questions because he is wholly misrepresenting the situation <e> <s> the fact is that the lebanese government are doing their best to maintain law and order in their country and at the moment are very much obstructed by the irregular forces of major haddad which are operating in the south of that country <e> <s> those forces we are told are supported and encouraged by the israelis <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord did not quite hear my original answer when i said as i have said so many times before from this box that we condemn all acts of terrorism from wherever they come and whoever may perpetrate them <e> <s> the fact is as i have said on many occasions before and as your lordships will know in any event that the problems in southern lebanon are at the moment under control or we would wish they were more under control by <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a wholly different matter and of course those sort of things come within the compass of an overall settlement in that area <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure who the noble lord is referring to when he talks about countries not honouring their commitments under international law on this matter but as far as the lebanese are concerned they of course are party to the fact that the united nations forces are present in their country and the situation there would be greatly helped if those united nations forces received more co-operation <e>", "<cs> my lords that sounds a most interesting suggestion which clearly ought to be looked into further <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the noble lord is quite right <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i should like to repeat a statement which is being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for trade about the accident at tenerife last friday <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to noble lords for their reception of this statement <e> <s> to answer the noble lord lord ponsonby the report is in fact prepared by the spanish authorities and thus the timing of its publication is a matter for them <e> <s> however there are <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i said that <e> <s> the airfield is feet above sea level and the height of feet which is the height above sea level as the noble lord suggested is the correct height for the approach procedure to runway / <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may first answer the last supplementary under international agreements the spanish authorities are required to provide a copy of their report to the country of registry and i have no doubt that they will do that <e> <s> publication by us of a spanish report can only be done i think with the agreement of the spanish authorities but i have no reason to believe that they will withhold that permission <e> <s> as for the earlier supplementary of my noble friend i understand that it is not intended that the new airport should replace los rodeos because the two airports are located at opposite ends of the island and it is proposed that in future they should each serve the different resorts nearest to them <e>", "<cs> certainly my lords <e> <s> as i indicated in the statement we very much appreciate those expressions of grief <e>", "<cs> i understand it would be convenient if we were to take the statement now <e> <s> therefore i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government participated in the consensus in the united nations general assembly which called for global negotiations <e> <s> we are joining actively in preparatory work for the negotiations now under way in new york <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not yet in a position to give our <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot confirm the last point which the noble lord has raised because i do not have the information in front of me but i have no reason to believe that what the noble lord says is not correct <e> <s> as for the general assertion which he made at the outset of his supplementary question that aid is beneficial to the donors as well as to the recipients because of the increased markets which are thereby generated while that certainly is a consideration there are others as well including our ability to find the money <e>", "<cs> my lords the brandt commission report which your lordships discussed some weeks ago is certainly a very important and weighty <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we want to be careful before making statements of that nature which might raise expectations which could not in the event be realised <e>", "<cs> my lords i must repeat that we are not yet in a position to announce our conclusions on the brandt commission report but the considerations certainly go wider than the simple one which the noble lord has often put that it promotes the interests of our own industries here at home <e>", "<cs> my lords i think my noble friend over-simplifies the position <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of indebtedness to the third world was only one of the matters raised in the brandt commission report which as your lordships know is a very comprehensive and lengthy document <e> <s> but the government will certainly reach their conclusions on this matter as soon as they reasonably can <e>", "<cs> i have a feeling that is a catch question my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords energy is one of the matters which will be considered by the conference which was the subject of the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords the agenda for this conference has not yet been agreed <e> <s> i think the noble lord is ahead of himself <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the report is available from the commonwealth secretariat <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be so but the question i was asked was whether we would publish the report <e> <s> the answer is no we will not because as i said originally it is available from the commonwealth secretariat <e> <s> why therefore the government should publish it i am not certain <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not holding back on it <e> <s> if the noble baroness wants a copy she can get it from the commonwealth secretariat <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord knows the report is a lengthy document <e> <s> i cannot give the undertaking that he asks for <e> <s> the noble lord referred to the fact that the report had not been widely referred to in the newspapers <e> <s> we have no more ability to push things into newspapers than we have to get them out <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e>", "<cs> no my lords i understand that it is not available there at present <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not given an undertaking that this report will be put in the printed paper office <e>", "<cs> my lords i will undertake to put a copy in the library if that is your lordships wish <e>", "<cs> my lords i must reject that <e> <s> the elections in rhodesia were not rife with fraud and intimidation <e>", "<cs> my lords as so often in the past your lordships will be grateful both to the ecc select committee for preparing this valuable and thoughtful report and to my noble friend lord drumalbyn for bringing it to your lordships attention today <e> <s> the care and moderation shown by the authors of the report are very clear and the government can agree with many of its judgments <e>", "<cs> my lords the government share the hope of the archbishop of canterbury and other anglican leaders that the south african government will return bishop tutus passport <e> <s> we have already drawn the south african governments attention to the extent of public concern in this country over this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that the noble lord is entirely right in what he says about the oath that your lordships take at the beginning of each session but i think that noble lords would certainly wish to agree with the sentiments expressed by the most reverend primate and his prelates at canterbury <e>", "<cs> my lords we have already made clear to the south african government the extent of public concern in the united kingdom on this matter <e> <s> i should make it clear now that neither in the case of the archbishop nor in that of the reverend david russell whom the right reverend prelate mentioned have we any <e>", "<cs> my lords the commonwealth development corporation is awaiting the appraisal report on this project from the international finance corporation in the light of feasibility studies by technical consultants <e> <s> capital aid of million was provided in under the special aid and trade arrangements for the purchase of an hs aeroplane <e> <s> a small capital project involving assistance to the cashew nut industry is under consideration <e> <s> in addition there is a technical co-operation programme covering english language teaching a few technical experts and some training awards <e> <s> senegal also benefits from european and international aid programmes to which we contributed <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> there are certainly a good many trade prospects which we hope can be developed between senegal and the united kingdom <e> <s> it is therefore very appropriate that the senegal foreign minister mr niasse is in london just now <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is entirely right about the reputation of the cdc although i should say that when the cdc starts operations in any new country it requires ministerial approval which has not yet been sought in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said ministerial approval is required before the cdc can commence operations in any new country <e> <s> each application will be considered on its merits <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a matter for the cdc themselves <e> <s> when they have received the ifc appraisal report they will if they are still persuaded of the merits of this project as no doubt they will be make their application for ministerial approval which we shall then consider in the usual way <e>", "<cs> my lords in the calendar year the united kingdom contributed to the united nations a total under all heads of million <e> <s> of this million was paid in assessed contributions and million in voluntary contributions <e>", "<cs> my lords the contributions to the regular budget of the united nations were outstanding from no less than member states including the soviet union on st december <e> <s> if my noble friend will allow me to do so i will place a document giving all the details in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords the assessed contributions to the united nations budget are arrived at as a result of a rather complicated formula relating to gnp population and other factors but we contribute about per cent <e> <s> to the uns total budget <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether the noble lord really expects an answer to that question but of course we comply with the undertakings which we have given in the united nations charter <e>", "<cs> my lords the second figure to which i referred the voluntary contributions of million does indeed include our contribution to the agencies <e>", "<cs> my lords the arrears of contributions from the various nations to which i have referred have a disadvantageous effect upon the finances of the united nations generally <e> <s> under the united nations agreement countries which are more than two years in arrears lose their vote and all the countries concerned tend to pay up just before the two years run out <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right <e>", "<cs> my lords we joined in the security council resolution adopted unanimously on th december which condemned the seizure of the hostages <e> <s> we voted for the later sanctions resolution on iran of th january which was vetoed by the soviet union <e> <s> we fully supported the last united nations initiative namely the five-man commission of lawyers which visited tehran from rd february to th march but whose efforts to find a solution were sadly thwarted <e> <s> at the european council meeting in luxembourg on th april which my noble friend the foreign and commonwealth secretary attended with the prime minister we assured the secretary-general of the united nations of our full support for his continuing efforts to find a political solution <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we do not support mischievous resolutions as my noble friend described them that come before the united nations <e> <s> i think that we exercise an influence which is considerably more powerful than our mere size in the world would otherwise justify <e> <s> as for the situation in iran which is the subject of my noble friends question certainly the secretary-general is considering what steps to take next and we are in close touch with him <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we want to be very careful before embarking upon further military exercises or adventures <e> <s> the situation is now quite difficult but we think that progress is possible for the time being anyway through quiet diplomacy behind the scenes <e> <s> having said that may i add that my noble friend the leader of the house will shortly be making an announcement about legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall certainly be doing that <e> <s> that is why sir john graham has recently returned to tehran <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a matter for the british airports authority <e> <s> i will draw the noble lords question to their attention <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments influence in this matter as my noble friend described it is very strictly limited because parliament has put responsibility for these matters upon the british airports authority <e> <s> they will wish to proceed with the proposal which my noble friend described only when they can see it earning a proper return and i must tell my noble friend that i think that is unlikely <e> <s> but i certainly agree that it would be desirable from the point of view that my noble friend described <e>", "<cs> my lords dr ugarte visited the united kingdom at the invitation of the british overseas trade board <e> <s> his visit was in the nature of a normal ministerial exchange on commercial relations <e> <s> in addition to calls on ministers in the departments of trade and industry dr ugarte met several united kingdom companies banks and institutions interested in trade with paraguay <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with almost everything that my noble friend has said <e> <s> the visit of dr ugarte was a most helpful one and we certainly hope that british companies will take advantage of the opportunities now offering <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i shall intervene to repeat a statement being made in another place by my honourable friend mr hurd on anglo-libyan relations <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to both noble lords for what they have said in response to this statement <e> <s> may i deal first briefly with the points raised by the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts <e> <s> the personnel who are being withdrawn at our request are exhaustive so far as we know <e> <s> the position is of course that we require every diplomat in london accredited or otherwise to obey the law and when their activities seem to us to depart from that precept then we seek their withdrawal <e> <s> as for agreeing to the personnel of the libyan mission here in london the present position is rather complicated owing to the fact as we said <e>", "<cs> my lords there is clearly no difficulty in the schools being used for proper educational purposes as the libyans are apparently at present proposing <e> <s> of course the precise use of the premises is a planning matter and that comes within the compass of the local authority and not her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no evidence that any of the four persons referred to in the statement was directly implicated in the recent murders <e> <s> they were involved however in the harassment of libyans resident in the united kingdom <e> <s> this apparently included attempted kidnapping and a subsequent attempt to pervert the course of justice but i can further add that there are three other people currently helping the police with their inquiries in respect of the murders to which the noble and learned lord referred <e>", "<cs> my lords we have no reason to believe that there is any threat to the safety of our citizens in libya <e>", "<cs> quite so my lords <e> <s> in moving the first motion standing in my name on the order paper i will with your lordships permission speak at the same time to the second motion standing in my name but move the latter only formally when we come to it <e>", "<cs> i have it in mind my lords that i should speak again at the end of this short debate and perhaps the noble and learned lord will allow me to deal with that matter in more detail then <e> <s> as i said mr mugabe has stated that his government will honour pre-udi debts and talks are taking place in london at the moment with a view to reaching a mutually acceptable arrangement <e>", "<cs> my lords i confess to being somewhat surprised by the tone adopted by some of your lordships concerning this order especially as <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that is not the position <e> <s> i think the noble and learned lord may be referring to the oft-quoted million of aid <e> <s> it is certainly not the case that repayment of debts should come from that aid allocation but it is the case that the various debts incurred during udi which have now been accepted by the new government will have to be repaid in due course <e> <s> but doubtless like all the other debts which mr mugabe has accepted the timing and dates of repayment will be negotiated with the creditors and agreed in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not got that information in front of me but i will find out if i may and write to the noble lord <e> <s> i was coming to the remarks of the noble lord lord hatch who i think once again if i may say so has not fully understood the nature and extent of the change which has taken place in zimbabwe

goronwy-roberts who referred to a blanket and retrospective amnesty i will say as i said earlier this is no such thing <e> <s> i must also refute the allegation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord i think is describing a purely hypothetical situation <e> <s> the situation we are faced with at present is that there have been a number of prosecutions which will stand <e> <s> there is no question of

interventions <e> <s> if your lordships will allow me i will not attempt to answer all these points in depth or detail now but i will study what has been said and if there is anything that needs to be taken up i will correspond with the noble lords in question <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords the australian government stated in may that they had given approval for concorde to begin regular services to australia <e> <s> it is for british airways to determine when such services should begin but certain supersonic overflight clearances would be required <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not the case that all the necessary overflight permissions are available <e> <s> indeed there are good reasons why one should not necessarily seek those sort of rights long in advance of when they might be required <e> <s> while it is true to say that concorde is operating very satsifactorily on the north atlantic i understand that the commercial results on the singapore route are so far not quite so good <e>", "<cs> my lords there are discussions going on with saudi arabians on that point at the moment <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will not press

to begin by echoing the words of almost every noble lord this afternoon who has referred to the seriousness and gravity of the problem before us <e> <s> i do not need to recite again in detail the sequence of events which have led us to this position today but we should i think remember as my noble friend has said that in november last year a group of terrorists for they are no other calling themselves students invaded the embassy of the united states seized or destroyed documents and other property and then took a number of diplomats hostage <e> <s> today more than six months later the embassy remains in unlawful hands and most of all the hostages are still incarcerated <e> <s> of course the worst aspect is the position of the iranian government who have at least acquiesced in these flagrant breaches of international law <e>", "<cs> i will certainly consider what the noble lord has said my lords but we are still left with the difficulty even having regard to the probability of maximum opposition cooperation in this matter of what to do when parliament is not in session for example in the summer recess which might go on for several weeks even months <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure your lordships will accept that <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend will allow me to write to him on the question of insurance companies because it is a rather complex and involved matter which might unduly detain your lordships now <e> <s> as for the question of the subsidiary branches of united states banks which my noble friend also raised the matter is <e>", "<cs> my lords i have nothing to add to what my right honourable friend the prime minister said in the other place on st may <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that is entirely right <e> <s> what i have not been prepared to undertake is that

bill <e> <s> i do not really want to be dragged into answering all the points put by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> no my lords we believe that the best way of supporting those whose only crime is that of working for the full implementation of the final act is to continue to take part in the helsinki process <e>", "<cs> my lords as for raising the matter of individual cases with the soviet union we do this on a selective basis <e> <s> first of course we make representations on those where we have a formal <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i am not informed as to what is going on in the american congress at the present time <e> <s> but as for a british group on this matter there are a number of people who are of course taking an interest not least the noble lord lord caccia who i see in his place now <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that what the noble lord says is exactly right <e> <s> indeed as the noble lord will know the foreign office gives his current group every support <e>", "<cs>

not i think necessarily the most important part <e> <s> the matter of human rights is certainly the one which has attracted the most international attention and rightly so <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the only way of persuading the russians for example to comply with and live up to their undertakings given so freely in regard to the helsinki final act is to persuade them in open forum and to bring to bear the full weight of international public opinion <e> <s> that is why we think it is so important that we should go for example to the madrid conference <e>", "<cs> my lords the case of mr shcharansky which i referred to in your lordships house when i answered a question from my noble friend lord renton on st april is indeed one of particular concern and we made a representation on that particular case some months ago <e> <s> but in general as i have said before we have to be selective in these matters because if we were to make representations in each and every case that is brought to our attention and as the noble lord says there are indeed a great many altogether i think we would degrade the effect of our representations <e>", "<cs> my lords the committee on disarmament has established a working group to agree a convention prohibiting radiological weapons <e> <s> the group has before it the elements of such a convention presented jointly by the united states and the soviet union <e> <s> we hope that agreement can be reached by the end of the committees summer session <e>", "<cs> my lords these two conventions deal with quite different classes of weapon <e> <s> the radiological weapon which is the subject of this question is a weapon which relies for its effect on the deliberate widespread and indiscriminate dispersal of highly radioactive materials stored in the weapon <e> <s> no nuclear explosion or any other explosion is involved and this is therefore quite different from the kinds of weapon considered in the convention to which the noble lord refers

remarks as short as we can otherwise some noble lords may be deprived of the right to speak <e>", "<cs> my lords i confess to experiencing some degree of surprise when i found myself making ready to answer the debate having regard to the fact which several noble lords have mentioned that the conference in canberra ended only yesterday and of course in the short time since then it has not been possible to make a full appreciation of the proceedings there <e> <s> i appreciate the vagaries of the short debate procedure in which we are subject to the ballot but all the same my hands are rather tied <e>", "<cs> my lords what the noble lord says may well be right <e> <s> i am not informed on the position of the american government in this matter but i shall certainly look further into that proposition and see whether i can be more helpful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord for pointing that out and of course he is entirely right <e> <s> several noble

agreement if it were to be effective and british exporters were not to be put at a competitive disadvantage <e>", "<cs> no my lords i would not say that <e> <s> there is certainly no such thing as a free-for-all as my noble friend describes it in interest rates in this matter but we need to reach agreement by consensus and that is what we are doing <e>", "<cs> my lords the olympic games is another matter but certainly it is true that the russians rely very much upon technology provided from both europe and the united states and i have no doubt that they are feeling the draught just now <e>", "<cs> my lords i would have to find out and write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the sovereign base areas are not on the territory of the republic of cyprus <e> <s> they are sovereign british territory <e> <s> no fees or rent are payable for their use <e>", "<cs> no my lords what we should be doing is complying with the agreement which we entered into with the cyprus government in respect of the use of those bases <e> <s> that agreement which was signed in did not provide for the payment of rent <e>", "<cs> no my lords we met all our obligations to the republic of cyprus <e> <s> however with regard to the bases which are the subject of the question on the order paper there is no question of britain having failed to meet her obligations <e> <s> there was some aid promised under the agreement which was given <e> <s> apart from substantial contributions to refugee relief and to the united nations peacekeeping forces in cyprus a million loan was offered in <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right in suggesting <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the case that the movable assets to which the noble lord refers could be returned to the turkish cypriots in question only by being transported through greek-turkish territory and thus that return would need the agreement of those cypriots <e> <s> it has not been possible to obtain that agreement for the moment but we hope that it will be possible to do so in the context of an overall agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords it would certainly be possible for the government to say that but not within the context of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords that point too is outside the scope of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords as my right honourable friend the prime minister said in another place on th may she has already asked british athletes to think again in the light of the decisions by the olympic committees of the united states and the federal republic of germany not to go to moscow <e> <s> the government have throughout made clear their view that participating in the olympics would be tantamount to condoning soviet aggression in afghanistan <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely right <e> <s> it is without doubt the case that if the olympic games proceed unhampered it will be a political and diplomatic <e>", "<cs> my lords i reject that absolutely <e> <s> may i say that i find it difficult to distinguish between the soviet olympic committee and the soviet government <e> <s> there is little distinction between the two <e> <s> the senior officials of the soviet olympic committee are senior civil servants in the russian government <e> <s> as for the position of the athletes we do not think it is wrong to ask them to do their public duty <e>", "<cs> my lords the government very much regret that the british olympic association still apparently intend to go to moscow <e> <s> we hope even now that they will see fit to change their mind <e> <s> on the subject of freedom which my noble friend raised i can refer to the freedom of all those dissidents in russia who are being rounded up and imprisoned before the athletes get there <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is a different question <e> <s> the fact is that we have made plain our view on british participation in sporting events in south africa in the same way as we are doing with regard to moscow <e>", "<cs> my lords it might be wrong of me to comment directly on that supplementary question but i can say that as your lordships may know my right honourable friend the prime minister recently wrote again to sir denis follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give my noble friend an estimate of the numbers <e> <s> they are certainly substantial and i think they go to prove our point <e>", "<cs> my lords i still live in a free country as does the noble lord <e> <s> we will not take away their passports <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> a large number of countries have said they are not going <e> <s> from memory i think the number is now and not <e>", "<cs> my lords the government welcome the indications of improved relations between kenya and somalia but we have no plans to offer military aid to somalia <e>", "<cs> my lords the amount of humanitarian aid which we can give to somalia depends not only upon the scope of the problem which i readily acknowledge but also of course upon our resources <e> <s> as for military aid of course we have to view that in a <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that we do keep in close consultation with the americans in this and all other matters <e>", "<cs> my lords we are always prepared to consider any approach from the united nations high commissioner for refugees but as i said earlier our response must be tailored to our resources <e>", "<cs> my lords that is one of a good many proposals of its kind which we see from time to time <e> <s> all of them are examined carefully but that one in particular suffers from a number of shortcomings <e>", "<cs> my lords that is no doubt the case but it does not i think arise from the question <e>", "<cs> my lords although i have answered more than one starred question on the matter before us tonight this is the first occasion on which i have been able to put the governments position in any detail <e> <s> i am therefore grateful to my noble friend lord kimberley for this opportunity to do so <e> <s> first i want to emphasise that the governments attitude towards britains participation in the moscow olympics stems from our belief that the success or failure of the games will affect every nation of the world and each and every one of their people <e> <s> as i ventured to suggest to your lordships some months ago the edifice of detente has lately been shaken to its very foundations <e> <s> indeed the new climate in international relations threatens a return to the cold war of years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords the bbc external services will be financed by grants in aid in and <e> <s> the grants will be based on estimates to be submitted by the external services in due course they will be subject to the usual treasury and parliamentary approval <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly accept that the invasion of afghanistan created something of a new situation in that part of the world and that is why we increased the broadcasts in russian and in farsi which is the language spoken by the majority of the people of afghanistan but the external services as a whole cannot be exempt from the governments general scrutiny of public expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the economies that we have inevitably been forced to make in the external services of the bbc are fairly modest by all standards and i am quite satisfied that the external services will remain as effective as ever <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a fairly high-powered theoretical argument but i certainly accept that the external services are important and that is why as i said we have been able to prevent the worst effects of our cuts falling on them <e>", "<cs> my lords whichever government department is responsible for the external services the money still has to come from the same place <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i can assure the noble lord that the bbc external services are quite separately funded from the bbc domestic services <e>", "<cs> my lords i absolutely agree with the noble baroness to the extent of course that the bbc external services enjoy total editorial freedom and long may it so remain <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware that that particular language which i confess i do not think i have even heard of was not in the repertoire of the bbc external services but i will consider that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that in these matters we have to distinguish between quality and quantity <e> <s> the quantity pumped out by the soviet union is in no way comparable to the quality of our services <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of that view <e>", "<cs> my lords nothing alas is cheap in this world and the financial provision for the external services is something in excess of <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i shall make a statement on the new hebrides <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to both noble lords for their response to the statement <e> <s> the implication of the remarks of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly agree that the situation is very grave <e> <s> but all the same the use of force would be a regrettable step that we could only contemplate as the very last resort <e> <s> that last resort is not quite with us yet but will be very soon <e>", "<cs> my lords i am reluctant to embark upon a new policy of gun-boat diplomacy but i can tell the house that contingency plans are fully prepared <e>", "<cs> my lords may i respond to the noble lord lord brock-way before dealing with any other points the noble lord referred to the root causes of this problem <e> <s> i fancy that they are rather simpler than the noble lord suggested <e> <s> the constitution was agreed the elections were held and we seem to have a disgruntled man who lost the elections <e> <s> that is perhaps the distinction if i may mention it to your lordships between the condominium and anguilla which has so often been referred to as a similar case <e> <s> this man lost the elections his supporters did not gain the acclaim of the electorate and that is why he must not be allowed to succeed <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the other countries in that part of the world have a deep interest in this matter and are being kept fully informed <e>", "<cs> my lords if the commonwealth secretariat were to circulate such a request we would certainly consider it carefully <e> <s> it would of course be for the ugandan government to approach the secretary-general first <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier in the first instance this is really a matter for the ugandan government and i should not want to be pressed to give a government view before we knew precisely what the ugandan government had in mind <e> <s> however as i also said earlier we shall certainly consider the matter very carefully in due course if called upon to do so <e> <s> i can say that a representative of the secretary-general visited kampala just before the latest events to discuss a possible common-wealth role in the elections with the then president president binaissa and we have also been in touch with the secretariat <e>", "<cs> certainly my lords i should be very glad to answer questions put down for me but of course private notice questions are a matter for my noble friend the leader of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the security situation in uganda is far from satisfactory but i do not think that i should go so far as to say that a state of anarchy prevails <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not see the broadcast to which the noble lord refers but i understand that what the noble lord mentions was one of the things that mr amin said <e> <s> with regard to british participation in this matter i consider that we need to be careful not to draw too many parallels between this case and the case of zimbabwe which was referred to in the original question <e> <s> the two situations are very different indeed and solutions found to be appropriate in one case may not necessarily be appropriate in another <e>", "<cs> my lords in my experience the voluntary agencies need no persuading by the government in these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we would be transgressing the proper procedures in this matter if we were to interfere in the internal affairs of uganda <e> <s> in any event it is quite clearly for them in the first instance to invite the united nations to supervise their elections <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite certain that the commonwealth secretariat is already aware of these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the iran trading sanctions order laid before the house on th may be approved <e> <s> with your lordships permission i propose to speak at the same time to the second motion on the order paper in my name relating to the export of goods control iran sanctions order <e>", "<cs> that is not quite correct my lords <e> <s> i said quite clearly in my speech that there was no immediate prospect of the act being used <e>", "<cs> i explained my lords <e>", "<cs> that is not what i said my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i explained that in my speech quite clearly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that these orders have not received the universal approbation of your lordships <e> <s> i rather thought that the speech of the noble lord lord hatch of lusby referred more to the act as it now is which we discussed some weeks ago than to the orders before your lordships tonight <e> <s> the noble lord complained about coordination within the european community <e> <s> as i said to him machinery is established for this purpose <e> <s> it is working very well <e> <s> of course it is true to say that the legislative methods by which the different members of the community apply their sanctions vary <e> <s> they have different systems from ours but as i said the end effects are broadly speaking the same <e>", "<cs> my lords i am coming to the point of retrospection the noble lord must contain himself <e> <s> the parliamentary position regarding retrospection became very clear when my right honourable friend the lord privy seal made his first announcement on this matter <e> <s> i think the noble lord lord hatch of lusby is naive to suggest that the view of the other place at least was not very clearly expressed <e> <s> perhaps when the noble lord has spent a few more years in parliament he may begin to understand how views are expressed in the other place <e> <s> it was quite clear that the retrospection which was part of the original proposal could not be achieved at least in the other place <e>", "<cs> yes of course my lords they will look at every one and will follow up those which in their view deserve further investigation because for some reason or another they are suspicious or perhaps the declarations do not comply with the precise wording required <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords british airways operate the bus service between victoria terminal and heathrow airport and at present have no plans for any change in that service <e> <s> the bus service between the west london air terminal and heathrow airport was discontinued in and there are no plans for it to be resumed <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not see the programme to which the noble baroness refers but i shall certainly try to get hold of a transcript to see whether the things in it are relevant to the question that the noble baroness has put to me this afternoon <e> <s> the noble baroness referred to the declining numbers of tourists <e> <s> i am not sure that that is correct in every field of tourism but it is certainly the case that the bus service to which the noble baroness refers has been losing money <e>", "<cs> i certainly will take that on board my lords but i can say as i said in my original answer that british airways have no plans for such a service <e>", "<cs> my lords the conduct of services such as this is a matter for british airways and they must make these decisions in the light of the commercial prospects <e> <s> both the service from the west london terminal which was terminated a year ago and the victoria terminal are losing money and this must therefore be a matter for british airways <e> <s> as for the general matter of passengers with luggage while i accept that there are some difficulties for passengers with very large amounts of heavy luggage on the underground service there is already an existing green line bus service to london airport and i must say that those with large amounts of heavy baggage really ought to consider whether they should not use a car or a taxi of some sort <e>", "<cs> my lords we are talking about people who are going to london airport to travel long distances at very considerable expense <e> <s> i certainly agree that taxis and cars are of course more expensive than the bus service but the fact is that the numbers of people who want to use the bus service are not sufficient to make that service viable <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think the noble lord is right in that <e> <s> the opening of the underground service to heathrow has proved a very considerable benefit for a great many travellers <e> <s> certain difficulties have been raised about travellers with for example a number of small children or a very large quantity of heavy baggage and i have answered those questions <e> <s> but it is not true to say that the arrangements are generally less good than they were they are not <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend is referring to the services from heathrow to scotland for example then i must tell him that the surface links between central london and heathrow are just as good as the surface links between central london and gatwick and i would advise my noble friend to think again <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said british airways who operate the present service have no plans to terminate it at the present time <e> <s> if there are all that many passengers who think that the service ought to be maintained as perhaps it should then they will show that by using the service

waters of the falkland islands were discussed in the recent talks in new york <e> <s> we continue to keep under close review the question of extending dependent territory fishing zones including those of the falkland islands and dependencies to miles but there are no plans to do so at present <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that these talks like all such talks are generally of a confidential nature and i cannot go into details <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that my noble friend heard what i said earlier <e> <s> talks of this nature are always confidential <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord for that helpful intervention <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall very shortly conclude our examination of the brandt commissions report <e> <s> the government will hold a debate in another place on the th june in the course of which we shall give our considered views <e>", "<cs> my lords i hardly think that we are exhibiting lack of urgency when i announced that our conclusions are almost complete and that we shall be giving them in a debate in another place on monday next <e> <s> but as for the report itself of course it is an important report <e> <s> it contains if my memory serves me aright nearly pages and we have been no longer than usual in fact rather quicker than usual in digesting it absorbing it and coming to our conclusions <e> <s> as to whether or not the matter will be discussed at venice <e>", "<cs> my lords i can say that european leaders at their council meeting in luxembourg on th and th april noted the significance of the brandt report and instructed that it should be taken into account in preparing community positions on north-south issues <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> there are a number of important issues dealt with in the brandt commissions report which need to have and are receiving careful consideration <e> <s> it needs both careful and urgent consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that our considered views were going to be put to the meeting in venice <e> <s> it is in any event open to the leaders of every government to speak frankly with their colleagues when they have these meetings <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord is quite right <e>", "<cs> my lords this will be determined in the light of ministerial consideration of the conclusions of the interdepartmental review of the corporation now under way and of other priority claims on the aid programme <e>", "<cs> no my lords i think that that is an over-simplified view of the financial arrangements of the corporation <e> <s> certainly they will be repaying money to the treasury this year but this is money they have borrowed in previous years <e> <s> the noble lord is right when he says that the figure for this year will be million <e>", "<cs> my lords the commonwealth secretariat are not directly involved in these matters but i have no doubt that they are fully aware of our plans and proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with the laudable aims and objects of the cdc to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> the fact is that the money we make available to the cdc has to come from within our limited resources and the proposals of the previous administration in this regard could not be sustained <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with the noble lords words that the government make a profit out of the cdc <e> <s> that is not a fair description of what takes place <e> <s> as i have said earlier the money we make available to the cdc wherever it comes from

have reservations about many of the specific items <e>", "<cs> no my lords this is a matter for the editors themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i will answer a private notice question put down a little earlier by the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts by repeating a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the lord privy seal <e> <s> it

lordships permission i shall make a statement on anglo-libyan relations <e>", "<cs> my lords to answer the point put to me by the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts and obliquely by the noble lord lord wigoder the number of diplomats in the peoples bureau as they now call their mission is uncertain <e> <s> we are in the process of going through the names and accrediting those who appear to justify being accredited <e> <s> however i am not able to give precise numbers at present because as i said in the case of some of the personnel there and as the noble lord lord wigoder mentioned there is some doubt as to their precise status <e> <s> but we are working to resolve that doubt and of course we shall accredit only those who are entitled to be accredited <e> <s> i can confirm to the noble lord lord wigoder that the law will of course be rigorously applied in every case <e>", "<cs> my lords yes indeed there will <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> we have an air services agreement with the soviet union which has the status of a treaty <e> <s> under that agreement aeroflot is entitled to operate services between the soviet union and the united kingdom as is british airways <e> <s> her

is true that charter services are not covered by the air services agreement <e> <s> they would need specific approval and it has been made clear that if such applications are made they will be considered at the highest level <e>", "<cs> my lords we took full note of the results of the recent a fatah congress in considering our policy at the european council <e> <s> any policy not involving recognition of israels right to live in peace is unacceptable to us <e> <s> there is no question of encouraging the palestine liberation organisation in such a policy <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord expressed his views very forcefully yesterday when my noble friend the foreign secretary made his original statement <e> <s> but the fact of the matter is that prospects of achieving a settlement in the middle east are not realistic without taking into account the positition of the palestinian people and the plo <e>", "<cs> my lords we sometimes receive a number of conflicting reports on the views of the plo and their associates and the document referred to in the question was one of them <e>", "<cs> my lords the balfour declaration was before my time <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we agree with the position of the state of israel which was carefully described in the declaration which came from venice the other day but to bring lloyd george into it is i think a bit much <e>", "<cs> yes my lords of course that is right but i was asked about the views of mr balfour and of mr lloyd george <e>", "<cs> i should have said the late lord lloyd-george <e> <s> this is history and of

not proper to deny a noble lord the right to speak <e> <s> in that case i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i will repeat a statement being made by my right honourable friend mr nott on hong kong to london air services <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to noble lords for what they have said <e> <s> i am sorry that they were not more receptive to this statement <e> <s> this case hinged on the judgment that my right honourable friend made upon the traffic available on this route <e> <s> my right

it except for laker airways which still have to make a successful application to the hong kong authorities <e> <s> as for intermediate stops my right honourable friend has not authorised any addition

representatives of the red cross in afghanistan <e>", "<cs> my lords the red cross of course is a wholly independent international body and i do not think that the government have any special influence with them but i can say that there was a red cross delegation in kabul until recently <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend the foreign secretary announced as far back as january a number of

difficulties in this area but they are moving to solve these difficulties and we wish to support their endeavours in that direction <e>", "<cs> my lords the restrictions on the air space around gibraltar airport do not threaten the safety of operations into gibraltar airport but they are certainly an inconvenience for airlines operating in there <e> <s> if there were a question of safety

there are already many exhibitions at home and overseas featuring british civil goods suitable for developing countries which buyers from those countries attend <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the brandt commission report was concerned more with providing the resources for these purchases than with displaying the goods or persuading the developing countries which goods they ought to purchase <e> <s> as for the suggestion of a single venue for such an exhibition i believe that the interests of the developing countries are best served by giving them a wide choice of specialist exhibitions

to <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer is of course drafted by all relevant departments <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is misinformed <e> <s> government support for the general classes of exhibition

in government ownership having regard in particular to its role in defence products <e> <s> i remember discussing that point with the noble lord when we dealt with the aerospace bill some months ago

the neb should be to catalyse and promote in the highest realms of technology enterprise which might not otherwise be launched <e> <s> but certainly it is no part of our policy that companies so

i think according to my information is likely to go very well <e> <s> however as regards the other point raised by my noble friend i can tell him that the original cost to the government of the ferranti rescue operation as it was then described was about million and the receipts to the government arising from this disposal are likely to be about million so the bargain is a good one <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we were of course anxious to see that the situation was asdescribed by the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until eight oclock

the hong kong licensing authority is a completely independent body and the matter is therefore solely one for them although when the original decision on the appeal was announced by my right honourable friend he expressed the hope that they would treat lakers application favourably <e>", "<cs> my lords that i suspect rather depends upon the number of passengers offering i do not suppose that we have heard the last of this matter in terms of low fare offers <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no information on that matter i am afraid <e> <s> we think that the proposals are not likely to stretch unduly the capacity of hong kong airport although i confess that it is fairly busy at present <e> <s> even if all the carriers operate at full frequency as forecast it is likely to be only some movements a week <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite sure that the hong kong licensing authority will want to consider all the factors but i cannot think that they would want to exclude laker simply on the grounds of the capacity at hong kong airport <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend is referring to the hong kong to london route there is no question of american airlines operating on that route <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to noble lords for their reception of these regulations <e> <s> i am glad i have not had to let off one of the stink bombs to get the measure through your

point is that the benzene is used as a solvent for the plastic from which the balloons are made <e> <s> the kit contains a little plastic tube with the dissolved plastic and thus there is a risk that the child would actually swallow some of the plastic and the benzene <e> <s> that is why it was necessary to prohibit the kits where they contained benzene <e> <s> kits that have recently come on the market do not i am informed contain benzene and they therefore are not caught by these regulations <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the purport of the advice was that the <e>", "<cs> my lords previous

to decide whether delegates should return to afghanistan <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my original answer it is for the international red cross themselves to decide when they should return to afghanistan <e> <s> i think that my noble friend does the international red cross no service if he suggests that they are subject to pressure by this government or any other <e>", "<cs> my lords again referring to the original answer which i gave to my noble friend i indicated that previous governments in afghanistan have recognised the international status of the irc and no change has occurred so far as we know to that position <e>", "<cs> that again my lords is an internal matter for the international red cross but i am sure that the noble baroness is right <e>", "<cs> my lords that is certainly correct but we hope that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft order laid before the house on th june be approved <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have

course <e>", "<cs> as i said my lords i will study what the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may prefer to study <e>", "<cs> my lords it is our firm intention that the madrid meeting should review comprehensively the extent to which all principles and provisions of the helsinki final act including particularly those to which the noble lord refers have been implemented or disregarded <e> <s> although disarmament will doubtless be raised it remains our view that it is most appropriately discussed in other fora <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that my answer reassured my noble friend <e> <s> certainly the most important aspect of the madrid review conference will be to consider the implementation up to now of the helsinki final act <e>", "<cs> my lords final decisions

circulated in our <e>", "<cs> my lords during the period of this administration and i think also of the previous one the government have made reports to parliament at six-monthly intervals and that is

together with our western partners we have told south africa that we are deeply concerned at their military activities in angola and that we hope that all sides will exercise restraint <e> <s> we will

seeks to compare those two events <e> <s> the situations are very different indeed <e> <s> in any event there is now conflicting information on the position in angola <e> <s> south africa maintains and indeed have so informed mr waldheim that all their troops have left angola although the angolans deny this <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is a very pertinent supplementary if i may say so although i do not have any information on it <e>", "<cs> my lords at the outset of his remarks the noble lord referred to the invitation as he put it for the cuban troops to enter angola <e> <s> i have come to be very suspicious of that type of invitation after what happened in afghanistan when the alleged invitation was apparently issued by someone who had been shot the day before <e> <s> as regards the condition of the prisoners to which the noble lord referred he will know that this matter was raised when dr viljoen came to london recently and the answers that we received were satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords the attitude of the south african government in this matter and the policies that they have pursued do lead us to make representations to them as i have already described <e> <s> but some of the assertions made by the united nations in this matter leave us with some doubts as well <e>", "<cs> my lords the south african government certainly maintain that they are striking back legitimately when they make these incursions into angola <e> <s> none the less we feel that these actions are to say the least unhelpful in the present circumstances and we hope that they will stop <e>", "<cs> yes my lords there is more than one un resolution on this matter <e> <s> the latest one resolution contained extreme language envisaging sanctions against south africa and indeed we abstained on that resolution <e> <s> however although as i have said we certainly believe that these last incursions were highly regrettable none the less there is a little light at the end of the tunnel in this matter and we are hoping to advocate a more constructive policy in future <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier these two situations are in no way comparable <e> <s> to begin with the south africans have now largely withdrawn from angola although i agree that there is room for more than one view as to whether they have completely withdrawn <e> <s> in any event the south african position on some of the other matters is rather more constructive <e> <s> for example responding to the secretary-general of the united nations on th may their communication contained some positive elements including commitment to international settlement and the demilitarised zone concept and other matters <e>", "<cs> my lords in taking his decision the secretary of state had regard to the profitability forecasts which were given in evidence at the hearing before the civil aviation authority <e> <s> the secretary of state in considering an appeal must do so on the basis of the evidence given at the hearing and he was satisfied that on the market forecast by laker four carriers could operate profitably <e>", "<cs> no my lords i would not agree with that <e> <s> costs depend first upon the efficiency of the operator and the revenue depends on the efficiency of operators in securing business <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> no my lords the profitability of the three- or four-carrier rgime depends as i have said upon the efficiency of the carriers and the costs which they therefore incur followed by their success or failure in obtaining the necessary business <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an interesting point <e>", "<cs> my lords the first part of my noble friends supplementary suggesting that we are specially supporting laker is a mistake <e> <s> we are not specially supporting any particular carrier <e> <s> as regards the british caledonian application to the civil aviation authority that is a matter for them upon which i could not comment <e>", "<cs>

matter and we hope that a preliminary report from it will be submitted to the central committee on disarmament at the end of august <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i think that the best way forward in disarmament matters generally is by a step-by-step approach such as this where one can identify individual areas where we can reach agreement with the soviets <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the

developing nations argue that the nonproliferation treaty discriminates in the nuclear weapons states favour <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly consider whether a further statement could be made

which it contains including the provisions for the national film finance corporation all of which are limited to five years are too short <e> <s> but the government do not feel that this is a valid criticism of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that in the government view it would not be right to relax the controls at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the difficulty with that proposal is that it would constitute a form of preference for european manufactured vehicles which i think would fall outside the provisions of the gatt <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but our

certain amount of immediate aid available million of reconstruction aid for joint funding through the voluntary agencies and a number of technical assistance teams <e> <s> at the same time we are doing everything we can to mobilise international opinion and international donors generally to do what they can as well <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right in what he says but it is still necessary for us to tailor our aid programme to our resources <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a number of international institutions which will we hope be providing aid to zimbabwe and of course the commonwealth can play an important role in them <e>", "<cs> no my lords on both counts <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has raised an important point <e> <s> i wonder whether i may deal with it rather more carefully than perhaps would normally be the case at question time <e> <s> my noble friend the foreign secretary was saying that political co-operation among the nine has increased in recent months but that we need nevertheless to look very carefully at the co-ordination of the wests efforts in the world especially in the light of what has happened in afghanistan and of how consultations should proceed in the alliance <e> <s> these are matters which we shall be pursuing with our friends <e> <s> consultation already happens very frequently the need is to make it more effective <e> <s> that requires patience and private discussion <e> <s> our purpose will be to consider how the resources of the west and its friends and of others who value independence and oppose soviet imperialism can be mobilised to promote economic development and political stability and thus reduce the likelihood of further crises like the one in afghanistan <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble lord is right in that assertion <e> <s> the difference of emphasis which some of our colleagues put on these matters is very natural having regard to the difference in our circumstances and the correct position is as my noble friend described it yesterday <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend is referring to the recent visit by chancellor schmidt to moscow and he tells me that he is there is something to be said for keeping open the lines of communication in a crisis and the soviet leaders on this occasion were at least confronted with some of the home truths about the position in afghanistan <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think the noble lord is right in what he says <e> <s> as i have said earlier while in this matter there is some difference of emphasis between ourselves and our colleagues in the nine we are in general united <e>", "<cs> my lords the government continue to support trade which is of real benefit to us but there should be no unreciprocated benefits for the soviet union and that is why we have not renewed the anglo-soviet credit agreement of which offered exceptionally preferential interest rates to the soviet union and why we are participating with our partners in discussions in cocom referred to in the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot of course speak for other governments but we certainly hope there will be a consensus in these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords we understand from the commission that at the talks between the community and the cmea from th to th july no substantial progress was made on the text of an agreement though the talks did serve to help clarify the position of the two sides <e>", "<cs> no my lords the main problem was the cmeas reluctance to engage in detailed discussions or indeed even to allow sufficient time for these during the meeting <e> <s> they declined to hold extra talks either on the evening of the th july or on the afternoon of the th july so making it impossible to discuss the whole of the draft agreement <e> <s> on that basis and in those circumstances i do not see much prospect of progress on these matters at madrid <e>", "<cs> certainly my lords it is the case that we would prefer to develop our trade relations by bilateral agreement with the countries of eastern europe and it may well be that the cmea members see it differently <e> <s> but there was none the less almost total inflexibility on the cmea side <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly as i said earlier we prefer to deal in these matters on a bilateral basis and that was the core of our position during these talks <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to start by a confession or at least a disclaimer which was put into my mind by my noble friend lord bessborough when he was recalling the words of my other noble friend lord boyd-carpenter who was once watching a harassed lord-in-waiting delivering a brief which he himself had prepared <e> <s> today so far as i know my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter has not prepared this brief <e> <s> but i am a trifle apprehensive about saying that because i must confess to your lordships that an envelope from the officials reached me via the hand of my noble friend <e> <s> i think i had better inquire further into that at some future moment <e>", "<cs> my lords the only broadcasts specifically directed to afghanistan by the bbc are those in the farsi language which is understood by about half of the population <e> <s> the bbc russian services are aimed at the soviet union but some of them are heard also in parts of afghanistan <e> <s> the bbcs capital expenditure programme to improve audibility is already under way and includes improvement of the audibility of the russian services <e>", "<cs> my lords some of the broadcasts to afghanistan are already made through the masirah link to which my noble friend refers <e> <s> indeed to judge by recent soviet media attacks on the bbcs external services the farsi broadcasts are clearly audible in afghanistan and are proving highly effective <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot say for sure that we receive a transcript of every word that is transmitted over the bbcs external services but we certainly know the general drift of what is being said <e>", "<cs> my lords the broadcasts to turkey are of course important but they do not fall under the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords swapo has long been recognised as a party to the united nations settlement plan for namibia <e> <s> there are a number of political parties competing for support in namibia <e> <s> the question of how much support each enjoys is for the namibian electorate to decide <e>", "<cs> i think not my lords <e> <s> as a member of the five to whom my noble friend referred we are seeking to secure a negotiated settlement of the namibian question <e> <s> that means that it would be very wrong not to have regard to the views expressed by swapo particularly bearing in mind that they are of course one of the parties taking part in the most unhappy military actions that are going on in that country <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord is quite right to the extent that it is important to involve swapo in the discussions which i hope will lead to a peaceful settlement in namibia <e> <s> but at the same time i should like to hesitate before drawing too many parallels between the situation in namibia and the situation in zimbabwe <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier we are seeking to achieve a negotiated settlement of the situation in namibia <e> <s> we certainly hope that the war to which i referred earlier will soon be brought to an end and we think the best way to do that is by consultation and negotiation <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an interesting thought but it rather departs from the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an interesting thought but again it is away from the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the draft european community fifth directive on company law is at present before the european parliament <e> <s> the next step is for the european parliament to give its opinion on the draft directive <e> <s> only then will the commission make a formal proposal to the council of ministers <e> <s> this is not expected for some considerable time and i cannot predict what action may be needed until the terms of the proposed directive are known <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall ensure that our preference for the voluntarist approach in this matter is conveyed to those preparing the directive <e>", "<cs> my lords the government will take steps to ensure that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e> <s> this bill is in two parts <e> <s> part i gives effect to the policy outlined in another place on th july last year regarding the introduction of a private sector shareholding in british airways part ii gives effect to a number of other aviation policies the most important of which reflects the change in the basis of the future relationship between government and the civil aviation authority <e> <s> i shall start by looking at the governments proposal to sell shares in british airways <e> <s> in doing so i will seek to define both our long-term objectives and the part which the bill plays in helping us to meet those objectives <e>", "<cs> my lords i am greatly obliged to my noble friend for giving way <e> <s> i am sure my noble friend will recall when i remind him that the appeal procedure to the act provides specifically that the secretary of state in considering an appeal may only take into account those matters which were taken into account at the original licence hearing <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been posed with a considerable task this evening to answer the very many points that have been raised <e> <s> therefore perhaps your lordships will forgive me if i reduce to the very minimum the opening general remarks of my reply and <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly the intention that the successor company will at the outset enjoy the services of the directors of all the corporation at the time of vesting but thereafter the directors will enjoy the same employment protection arrangements as do the directors of any other company of this nature <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to take advice on that <e> <s> perhaps i may write to the noble lord <e> <s> the noble lords lord ponsonby and lord beswick raised the question of the timing of the vesting and the sale of shares <e> <s> i can only reiterate what i said in my opening speech <e> <s> part i of the bill incorporates no timetable but is only the legislative framework <e> <s> the government have made it clear that no decisions have been reached on timing <e> <s> we wish to maintain complete flexibility to choose the best time <e> <s> sale of shares will take place when we consider the time is right taking into account the need for a successful flotation and the interests of all concerned <e> <s> the earliest possible time for a flotation would be i suppose the summer of but i must emphasise that it is too early to take any decision at this time <e>", "<cs> my lords i would refer my noble friend to the remarks of my right honourable friend and his right honourable friend the secretary of state when he made the announcement on this matter in another place on <e>", "<cs> my lords think that there were four applicants before the civil aviation authority and that it was very exceptional indeed for there to be such wide disparity in the traffic forecasts which came before the authority on that occasion <e> <s> my right honourable friend as he said at the time preferred the estimate of laker when he arrived at his decision <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend as the secretary of state is charged with considering these matters and he did so <e> <s> i am prepared to back his judgment in this case against that of the authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give an answer to that without <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would speak into the microphone there would be an improvement in audibility <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to start by thanking the noble <e>", "<cs> that may well be my lords but i was using the figures as a basis of comparison between ourselves and west germany <e> <s> since germany was last year the second largest western aid donor after the united states this increase makes an important contribution to meeting the needs of developing countries <e> <s> but the german government are enabled to take this action because their inflation is only at per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord for that further clarification <e> <s> as i said i will consider what the noble lord has said and write to him in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords i think with respect that that is another point <e>", "<cs> my lords there have been two such debates i think in your lordships house and others in another place <e> <s> i cannot think that there will not be more <e>", "<cs> my lords the government most certainly welcomed the opening of the zambian engineering services new headquarters in ashford kent on th june and the capital investment that that enterprise represents <e> <s> the government will continue to encourage foreign investment in britain <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a most interesting supplementary <e>", "<cs> my lords the question on the order paper refers to third world investment in britain not british investment in the third world <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we are aware of the recent drop in the number of exit visas being granted and we deplore the harassment of those in the soviet union who have protested at this <e> <s> we shall be pressing for improved performance at madrid <e>", "<cs> my lords we entirely agree with the noble lord that this situation is deplorable <e> <s> the average number of visas issued per month last year was about and the number issued in june this year was only <e>", "<cs> my lords the new hebrides became independent on th july <e> <s> they adopted the name of vanuatu and became the th member of the commonwealth <e> <s> on th july the government of vanuatu asked both britain and france to leave our troops in the country for a total of three weeks after independence <e> <s> we and the french have both acceded to this request <e> <s> british and french officials met in london yesterday as a prelude to a ministerial meeting on th august <e> <s> ministers will then consider how we can best help the vanuatu government to deal with their problems on the island of santo <e>", "<cs> my lords we have always preferred to solve this matter peacefully rather than by means of arresting people left right and centre or by military action and that i think we have achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may answer the last supplementary question first it appears to be the case that our troops have enjoyed their detachment in the new hebrides thus far for no less than five i understand have become engaged to local ladies <e> <s> as to the rumours of the arms supplied to the rebels the evidence to support those rumours is purely circumstantial and is not so far supported by any real facts <e> <s> but we have asked our high commissioner to look into them <e>", "<cs> yes my lords it is the case that the government there achieved a real majority in the recent elections <e> <s> they are now an independent nation with a duly elected government and thus the question of alliance with australia or papua new guinea must be one for them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether the young ladies will wish to accompany the soldiers in question or whether the soldiers would prefer to remain in the new hebrides <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been less progress than we would have wished <e> <s> but following the south african reply of th august to the united nations secretary-general the gap has been further narrowed <e> <s> south africa has agreed to receive a united nations secretariat team from th to th october in a further effort to reach agreement on early implementation of the united nations settlement plan <e>", "<cs> my lords most of the problems to which the noble lord refers have indeed been settled <e> <s> the main points in dispute now are the south african request for impartiality of treatment between swapo and the internal parties by the united nations organs together with the inclusion of internal parties in future consultations <e> <s> we hope that a settlement can be reached on these outstanding issues <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly south african consideration of some of these matters has taken longer than we would have wished <e> <s> however they have agreed to accept later this month the united nations secretariat team to which i have referred and we hope that the outstanding difficulties can then be resolved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure to which economic wealth the noble lord refers but if he refers to the uranium mine which has been the subject of considerable press comment then that is quite a separate matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the visit later this month to which i referred will be headed by the united nations and not by her majestys government <e> <s> in fact it will be led by mr urquhart who is the deputy secretary-general of the united nations <e> <s> british views on the <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the director general of <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord on both those points <e> <s> we certainly believe that the present situation in the marketing of spectacles and their associated appliances is unsatisfactory particularly with regard to the advertising provisions to which i referred <e> <s> we very much hope that the general optical council will see fit to change its rules <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord <e> <s> the situation is unsatisfactory and has gone on for too long <e> <s> this matter first came to public attention in and the time is long overdue for a change <e>", "<cs> my lords early warning intelligence about business projects supported by community finance is monitored by the world aid section of the projects and export policy division of the department of trade <e> <s> most advance projects information is disseminated to british firms and trade associations through the export intelligence service <e> <s> close contact is maintained with the office of the united kingdom permanent representative in brussels whose staff provide assistance to businessmen and advise them on contacts in the commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that british firms are at no disadvantage compared with their continental comptitors in this matter <e> <s> as i said the world aid section of the projects and export policy division of the department of trade monitors information about aid funded projects and disseminates this in good time to the export intelligence service <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly the case that british firms are not always as successful as some of their european competitors in this matter <e> <s> for example i understand that we contribute about per cent <e> <s> of total funds to the european development fund and to the period up to june secured only per cent <e> <s> of the work that flowed from that fund <e> <s> ministers have indeed expressed concern about the lack of interest shown by united kingdom exporters in pursuing edf business and they and officials take every opportunity to impress on businessmen the opportunities available <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that there are certain categories of other business available to british firms from the commission for example technical research projects and these are promoted in this country at least by the <e>", "<cs> i fear that is true my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until eight oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords the committee on disarmament which has a full programme has not initiated discussions on this item <e> <s> the british representative has not therefore expressed a view on the italian proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not necessarily the case because there are some limited but important military applications to be pursued in space that we are therefore pursuing an arms race in space that is not the case <e> <s> the british government are certainly opposed to an arms race in space <e> <s> indeed a research study on this subject by the foreign office arms control and disarmament research unit was published in december last year and copies are available in your lordships library <e>", "<cs> doubtless my lords but it is important to remember that there are a number of military activities which take place in space and which we would not wish to see affected for example the testing of inter-continental missiles military communications conducted through satellites satellite-borne navigation beacons and indeed the remote sensing of the earth by military surveillance satellites <e>", "<cs> not necessarily my lords for the reasons that i have already given <e> <s> in any event useful discussion in this matter could not proceed i think without an agreement or a heads of agreement at least between the united states and the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> the existing treaty in fact bans nuclear weapons and what are called weapons of mass destruction but certainly the surveillance capability which satellites possess is vital <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that was before my time <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> there is more than surveillance <e> <s> as i said earlier there are communications and navigation satellites but they too remain a vital part of our defence posture <e>", "<cs> my lords work is continuing in the nine on the basis of m thorns report and the principles set out in the venice declaration which remain valid <e> <s> contacts with all interested parties will be maintained <e> <s> the nine remain determined to make a constructive contribution towards a settlement <e>", "<cs> my lords m thorns mission has only just been completed <e> <s> the results of his discussions are still being assessed and it is too early to say what the next step will be <e> <s> as for the position of the plo to which my noble friend referred it is a significant element of palestinian opinion and it is not i think realistic to suggest that a settlement can be achieved without some participation from it <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the noble lord <e> <s> the european initiative is designed to run in parallel with the camp david process <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of m thorns recent mission was of course to determine the views of the various participants to the conflict in that part of the world and i would not at all agree that this precludes progress on the camp david process <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i agree that the european community has no magic formula in this matter but the community is now a powerful political force in the world and i believe that it can make an effective contribution on this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has on many occasions in your lordships house complained about what we propose in this matter but i would say again to him that a unilateral solution to this problem is not possible <e> <s> we believe that it is necessary to take account of the views of all the interested parties <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that the camp david process has not of late made as much progress as we would have hoped but it is far from dead <e> <s> certainly what my noble friend said in the remainder of his supplementary question is true <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord is reinforcing what i have said namely that the european initiative should run in parallel with the camp david process <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i will make a statement concerning the offer for sale of shares in british airways <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord ponsonby knows the airline industry is a very cyclical one and i can assure him and indeed the noble earl lord amherst that the announcement has been made as soon as practicable after the decision was taken <e> <s> parliament was not sitting until the beginning of last week and i tabled the relevant amendment to the civil aviation bill as soon as an opportunity presented itself <e> <s> we have gone out of our way to emphasise during the passage of this bill in the other place and so far in your lordships house that no decision had been taken on the precise date of the flotation and that remains the position <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so i think the noble lord is running somewhat ahead of himself <e> <s> by my calculations the election is not <e>", "<cs> no my lords that part of the bill will proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords before we return to the local government bill may i correct one thing that i said to the noble lord lord beswick <e> <s> i understand it is not intended to transfer the assets of the existing british airways to a new company until nearer the flotation date <e>", "<cs> my lords british airways announced some three weeks ago that they will cease their coach service between heathrow and the victoria terminal on th november <e> <s> however i am pleased to say that london transport will commence two new coach services linking london with heathrow airport one of which will run from victiora and these will start from th november the day after the british airways service is to cease <e> <s> the new london transport victoria to heathrow service will run from grosvenor gardens adjacent to victoria railway station and should therefore be more convenient for those passengers making onward travel arrangements by public transport <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the happy outcome to this matter and i hope the noble baroness agrees that that is what it is is in no small measure due to the pressure which the noble baroness has maintained from at least as far back as which date she mentioned on the three points which she raised there will indeed be shelter constructed in grosvenor gardens for these services and i understand that the necessary publicity or some publicity will be put in hand <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the frequency of this service will be the same as the frequency of the british airways service which it replaces <e>", "<cs> my lords i will convey to london transport the noble baronesss view about advertisements in the heathrow underground <e> <s> as for the point about baggage which she raised the question of crewing the services is a matter for london transport to which i suggest my noble friend refers her question <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness knows a new chairman was recently appointed to london transport who is i fancy very much aware of these points <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier to my noble friend lady trumpington the crewing of these buses is a matter for london transport to which i suggest my noble friend refers her question <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the times in front of me but i understand that the times of the first and last buses like the frequency of the service will be the same as for the british airways service which this service replaces <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that some of the coaches on the tube service are specially constructed so as to accept luggage but if i am wrong on that point perhaps i might write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords relations with chile were restored to ambassadorial level earlier this year <e> <s> on nd july my noble friend the foreign secretray informed your lordships that the embargo imposed by the last government on defence sales to chile would be lifted <e> <s> this remains the position <e>", "<cs> my lords the case to which the noble lord refers was drawn to our attention slightly later than the noble lord indicates <e> <s> the decision on the arms embargo was taken and announced before the allegations of torture came to our attention <e> <s> but in any event a single case such as that to which the noble lord has referred is not necessarily one that would alter our policies in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that the human rights situation in chile is less satisfactory by far than we would wish <e> <s> on the other hand it is the case that there has been an improvement in the situation there since when the embargo was imposed <e> <s> we have to judge our decisions and reach our conclusions on these matters in the light of all the considerations including british interests <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel sure that if my noble friend had been speaking at greater length he would have qualified some of the things that he said which is a general quotation which the noble lord has taken quite out of context <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> the fact is that the situation in chile although as i have said unsatisfactory is indeed not worse than in many other countries with which we have dealings <e> <s> all our european partners traded with chile including arms trading with chile during the time that we enforced the embargo <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that if the cardinal had looked elsewhere he would have found unfortunate evidence of human rights breaches and perhaps torture in other countries as well <e> <s> as for the supply of arms to chile although the overall embargo has been lifted all arms sales to chile remain subject to strict licensing procedures <e>", "<cs> no my lords it amounts to no such thing <e> <s> the purpose of diplomatic representation particularly as far as chile is concerned and indeed in all countries where the human rights question may be questionable is among other things to give us a better line of communication to that government and to make our views known on their policies <e>", "<cs> my lords that is rather wide of the original question <e> <s> so far as chile is concerned we would not license an arms sale where those arms were clearly intended for repressive purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier if my noble friend had been speaking at greater length i am sure he would have done so <e>", "<cs> my lords the government regret that the review conference was unable to reach consensus on a final document <e> <s> but the discussions revealed broad agreement in many important areas and underlined the commitment of the parties to the cause of non-proliferation <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not agree that the results of the review conference are profoundly disappointing but i would accept that they were slightly disappointing <e> <s> none the less the treaty remains intact <e> <s> there was no question of withdrawal by any of the parties and five signatories to the treaty so i think that all is not gloom <e> <s> however with regard to the other point made by the noble lord it is true that the general efforts at disarmament have not proceeded as fast as we all would have wished <e> <s> i do not think that even the most starry-eyed signatories to the nonproliferation treaty would have expected us to enter into disarmament agreements which were one-sided or underminded our defence posture <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the main difficulties regarding our negotiations with the soviet union on this matter is verification <e> <s> we need to be sure that any measures agreed between the parties at geneva or elsewhere can be properly verified <e> <s> so far that is not the case <e>", "<cs> my lords various proposals have been put forward in the past for alternative coach services between heathrow and central london and london transport have had to consider each case <e> <s> the transport act now provides prospective operators of any london bus service with the right of appeal to the minister of transport against a refusal by london transport to agree to the operation of the service <e> <s> the department of trade encouraged british airways to ensure that there would be continuity of a coach service between victoria and heathrow following their withdrawal from the route on th november <e>", "<cs> my lords that would be a question of crewing the bus concerned and that would be a matter for london transport <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that was a shortcoming of the previous arrangements <e> <s> happily the transport act has now provided for an appeal to the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is not compelled to use the underground service if he does not want it <e> <s> as i said on tuesday when i answered the noble baroness two new bus services are shortly to start which may suit the noble lord better <e>", "<cs> my lords that again would be a matter for london transport <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not hear every word that my noble friend said but it sounded to be another matter for london transport <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that the lisbon agreement has not yet been implemented <e> <s> the matter was raised when my noble friend the foreign secretary met the new spanish foreign minister in new york on th september he reaffirmed his commitment to early implementation of the agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that we are very disappointed that the spaniards have not been able to move more quickly in this matter <e> <s> we were certainly ready to implement our side of the arrangements by st june and we had indeed originally hoped that the spaniards would also be in that position <e> <s> however it is fair to say that the spanish foreign minister has only very recently taken up his post some four weeks ago and we hope that he will be able to make further progress in this matter very soon <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that this matter will be resolved long before spanish accession to the european community <e>", "<cs> my lords we made a constructive contribution to the formulation of an international development strategy for the s <e> <s> we worked for agreement on an agenda and procedures for the global negotiations on economic co-operation for development <e> <s> we regret that agreement did not prove possible <e> <s> however we will continue to work during the current general assembly for the successful launch of the global negotiations on a generally acceptable basis <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that that is an entirely accurate representation of what occurred <e> <s> what actually happened was that the other european members felt although they had the same reservations in principle as we had that the resolutions met the point <e> <s> we felt that they did not <e> <s> as for the views of mr mcnamara one of the other things he was suggesting was that our aid programme was not growing at the rate he would wish <e> <s> for that purpose he considered our contribution in to be inadequate <e> <s> we find this a bit puzzling because we have certainly not decided much less announced our programme for that year <e>", "<cs> the new economic order my lords is one of those things which has been talked about for a very long time as the noble lord knows but the fact remains that if we are to adhere to these very fine sentiments and they are indeed that we have first to find the money to do it with <e>", "<cs> my lords that last assertion if i may say so is unproven <e> <s> it is not necessarily the case that increased aid to third world countries would improve the industrial situation here at home <e> <s> for example the third world countries might choose to purchase their goods elsewhere <e> <s> i would say again <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if the noble lord thinks that i am unsympathetic over these matters because that is not the case but we must look at them realistically <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that is a matter we can solve on our own <e>", "<cs> i think not my lords <e> <s> the brandt commission report which was a very lengthy and comprehensive document as the noble lord will know and one which your lordships have discussed at length on at least two occasions had a number of very good things in it which we are pursuing <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that committee is already considering the brandt report <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i would not agree to that <e> <s> the fact is that the imf have recently

bill <e>", "<cs> throughout all stages of the consideration of this bill i and my honourable and right honourable colleagues have made it clear that we wish to preserve the fullest flexibility on the timing of the flotation and that we are free to choose the best possible time bearing in mind the interests of all concerned <e> <s> in any case the timing of the legislation and the subsequent procedures for vesting would have meant that the earliest but not the only time for sale was the summer of <e> <s> our announcement shows only that as circumstances have developed our judgment is that the appropriate time will not now be during <e> <s> whether it will be in or or what the precise date will be is still completely open and decisions will be taken in the light of trends both in the aviation industry and in the stock market <e>", "<cs> i am obliged first to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter for the good and wise things that he said about the directors and staff of british airways with which i wholly agree <e> <s> regarding the point which my noble friend and the noble lord lord beswick raised about the transfer of the assets to the new company it has been decided that this should not be done for the time being and indeed that it will take place much nearer the date that we eventually decide upon for the flotation <e> <s> but the commercial disabilities to which the noble lord referred are precisely the reason why it is that we wish to proceed with this legislation <e> <s> we believe that the commercial inhibitions upon british airways for example upon the amount of money which they may borrow to purchase new aircraft are not decisions which in the future the government wish to be concerned with <e> <s> that is why we wish british airways to be substantially a privately owned company as soon as may be <e>", "<cs> the only inhibition upon the commercial judgment of british airways in which i have total confidence is the obligation upon the government sometimes to restrict the amount of money which they may borrow and when they become a company in the private sector that inhibition of course will be removed <e>", "<cs> i am speaking without a note on this matter but my recollection is that every capital purchase by british airways i think in excess of million requires ministerial approval <e>", "<cs> yes that is so <e>", "<cs> i recognise the <e>", "<cs> the proposals that the secretary of state should nominate two non-executive directors to the board of the successor company have already been debated at very considerable length in another place <e> <s> the amendment as tabled would not have the effect which i believe the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede intends <e> <s> it would only require the secretary of state to appoint two non-executive members to the initial board and there would be no continuing arrangements <e>", "<cs> i apologise for intervening but would the noble lord agree that he is also speaking to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> these amendments are i confess somewhat similar like the previous ones to amendments proposed and debated at considerable length in the standing committee in another place <e> <s> i am advised that as drafted they would not achieve what i believe to be their intended effect which i recognise is to require the secretary of state to retain a majority shareholding at all times <e> <s> may i therefore address my remarks to that proposition which i must say at the outset in common with the amendments i cannot accept <e>", "<cs> i do not quite understand why the national airline which i agree has an important part to play in the aviation industry should actually be owned by the government <e> <s> that is if i may say so a <e>", "<cs> controlled by the government if not wholly owned by them <e> <s> before the noble lord lord ponsonby decides how to proceed with the amendment i will deal with the question of foreign ownership which i did not deal with when i spoke earlier and the safeguards against foreign takeovers a point raised by the noble lord lord leatherland and the noble earl lord amherst <e> <s> although i consider that such a possibility is remote there are a number of measures which could be taken should such a situation arise <e> <s> the first of these is incorporated into the articles of association of the successor company <e> <s> this provides that foreign-held shares carry only a per cent <e> <s> vote per share and this is coupled with a transparency provision which enables the company to determine the beneficial owner of the shares and in the case of any doubt treat the shares as foreign-held that is with reduced voting powers unless and until the shareholder proves otherwise <e> <s> the per cent <e> <s> vote per share effectively means that foreigners would have to own per cent <e> <s> of the issued shares to outvote the remaining per cent <e>", "<cs> this amendment would impose a statutory duty on the secretary of state to obtain the best price when selling shares that he has acquired under clause <e> <s> but what is the best price <e> <s> these two essential words are not defined <e> <s> that i confess does not surprise me because i doubt that they could be satisfactorily defined and the concept of the amendment is i fear therefore unworkable <e> <s> the only effect that it would have would be to cause an acrimonious and totally inconclusive argument after any sale of shares as to whether or not the best price had been secured <e> <s> how is the secretary of state to know in advance that if he sold a day sooner or a day later than the one he chooses he might get a penny or two more for each share <e> <s> the only possible definition of the best price is the price that investors are prepared to pay on the day chosen for the share sale <e>", "<cs> yes certainly the best professional advice that he can get and then act quickly <e> <s> the recent announcement that we will not proceed with a flotation in because of present difficulties in the airline market is i suggest firm evidence that the government will proceed only when we consider that the time is right and that i think refutes the assertion from the noble lord lord ponsonby that we would be acting for political rather than financial reasons <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say a last word on that <e> <s> we would wish <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that this amendment is unacceptable but i am happy to be able to respond positively to the first part of it which deals with opportunities for employee shareholdings <e> <s> the government have pledged firmly on a number of occasions and i repeat now that there will be suitable opportunities for british airways employees to acquire shares on favourable terms <e> <s> we believe it is important that they should be able to have a tangible stake in the successor company if they so wish <e>", "<cs> just before the noble lord presses this matter to a division if that is what he intends to do let us be quite clear what he intends by this amendment <e> <s> he intends that there should be one director on the board of this new company who is there by statute representing specifically one small group of shareholders <e> <s> it does not immediately occur to me whether it would be possible for that director to be removed by the shareholders for example at a special meeting <e> <s> the noble lords amendment does not tell us <e> <s> he is creating a precedent without equal in company law and i think it is an undesirable one <e> <s> if the noble lord does press it his amendment i hope that your lordships will reject it <e>", "<cs> i cannot let the noble lord get away with that <e> <s> he is not correct <e> <s> the statement on the intention to privatise british airways was made on th july long before the party conference <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that it would be of any benefit to the employees of british airways to have a formal requirement to consult the trade unions before setting the appointed day <e> <s> the government will choose an appointed day as near as we can to the time when we envisage shares will be offered for sale and we shall then have to act quickly <e> <s> i accept that this will involve an element of judgment but when the time comes we shall appoint a day after consultation with our professional advisers and with the board of british airways and therefore the decision will be taken having received the views and advice of those who have the most legitimate and appropriate interest in the matter <e> <s> of course i accept that the employees of british airways have a legitimate interest as well but i have no doubt that this interest will be adequately served by the consultation which we shall have with the british airways board <e> <s> the board is just as responsible for all the airlines employees as it is for the aircraft and the other assets <e>", "<cs> first may i deal with some of the points which have been raised <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter asked me about the governments proposals with regard to the consolidation of the various acts and i hope shortly this bill which now relate to civil aviation <e> <s> i have to confess at once that a consolidation measure is urgently required <e> <s> i am sorry that i cannot forecast when that will be possible <e> <s> i hope it will be before too long but i should be misleading your lordships if i were to give any hope that it will be in the next session <e> <s> i should like to think that it will be but i can give no undertaking that that is to be the case <e>", "<cs> the principal objection and objection it is i fear to this amendment is that it would require the civil aviation authority to promote competition between united kingdom airlines on international routes despite the fact that the authority is in no position to pursue such a policy <e> <s> regulation of air services on international routes by governments is however much we may regret it a fact of life in the civil aviation industry <e> <s> in practice this means that in most cases it is impossible to obtain the agreement of the authorities of other countries for more than one british airline to operate on a route and where it is possible the price demanded is usually unacceptably high <e>", "<cs> that is true but of course the bermuda ii agreement was not negotiated by the civil aviation authority <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to my noble friend for giving way once more <e> <s> i did not say that every foreign government forbids the operation of two british carriers on a route to their country <e> <s> the majority do but there are a few which do not <e> <s> the united states is one of them and hence the bermuda ii agreement and indeed there are one or two others <e> <s> however the great majority of foreign governments do not authorise more than one british carrier on routes to their country <e>", "<cs> i think not <e> <s> the section to which my noble friend has referred was not one designed specifically for dual designation <e> <s> on the contrary it was the basis of what came to be called the second force in british civil aviation and i think the noble lord is inadvertently misleading the committee if he seeks to call that particular section in aid of the arguments enshrined in his amendment <e> <s> i believe that my noble friend is seeking to impose upon the authority a duty which it can barely perform <e> <s> he has agreed and accepted that only a few countries allow dual designation as it is called on routes to their cities and yet he is seeking to impose this duty on the authority to promote that state of affairs on every route that comes within its purview <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has a short memory <e> <s> this is the second time he has read that subsection to us and my view has not changed <e> <s> the fact is that following that section a policy was designed where a second force airline came into being and indeed certain spheres of influence were devised and arranged where certain airlines for example british caledonian were flying to one part of the world while british airways as it has now become were flying to other parts <e> <s> it is not true to say that that section which the noble lord has now twice read was primarily designed to promote dual designation <e>", "<cs> i would never agree to that as the noble lord well knows <e> <s> section <e>", "<cs> i am surprised to put it mildly that the noble lord complains of a lack of competitive spirit in the air transport policy of the present government when he complains so bitterly of our applying that full principle to the hong kong route <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend decides what to do with his amendment perhaps he would just read the next paragraph of section a which we are now to incorporate in the act <e> <s> i am reading from the last few lines where duties are imposed on the authority and where it says <e>", "<cs> although the intention of this amendment is obviously benign if that is the right word it does not in fact do more than repeat duties already laid on the civil aviation authority by the civil aviation act <e> <s> paragraph <e>", "<cs> one of the difficulties to which i referred just now was to prepare a precise definition of the word best in this context <e> <s> and that is at least one of the reasons why i was not able to accept the amendment <e> <s> but certainly the duties laid on the authority by the original act include the need as i have explained to provide good economical air services <e>", "<cs> i am advised that there is some doubt about the drafting of my noble friends amendment and it is not entirely clear as to which subsection it refers <e> <s> however i accept and understand the substance of his intentions and perhaps i can apply my remarks to that <e>", "<cs> if i may intervene for a moment i can assure my noble friend that my right honourable friend the secretary of state appreciates the importance of this matter and certainly makes every effort on each and every occasion that an appeal is referred to him to reach his decision in the quickest possible time having regard to all the evidence that he has to consider <e>", "<cs> i think that i referred to that originally <e> <s> we envisage circumstances where there might be a minor perhaps only technical matter which the secretary of state would wish to reverse on appeal and thus the restriction to acting only when the matter was of substantial public importance is not one that we could accept <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the committee do now adjourn until ten minutes before eight <e>", "<cs> it is clear from what my noble friend said that it is his intention that the civil aviation authority should be given the power to designate or de-designate aerodromes for noise abatement purposes <e> <s> it seems clear to us that this is a power which may appropriately be held only by the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i would not want to get dragged too far into the specific case i have all the facts and correspondence with me <e> <s> we must strike a balance in these matters between the interests of all those people who live around heathrow and the interests of the airline and its passengers on the other hand <e> <s> british airways like all other airlines are well aware of the restrictions there are <e> <s> they are well aware of the fact that the discretion granted to the british airports authority in certain cases is a limited discretion and indeed they are encouraged to plan their operations so at least a small buffer of movements is available to them to cover precisely the circumstances that arose on the occasion to which my noble friend refers <e>", "<cs> if the amendment in the name of my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter is designed primarily or specifically to cover the case to which he referred on second reading i do not think it is it is a wider amendment than that i would still be concerned to resist it because in relation to that specific case i believe the governments position has always been clear that our policy has been laid down in clear terms and that it was <e>", "<cs> one particular reason for that is that if this matter had been transferred to the civil aviation authority then when my noble friend had asked about it i could have said quite simply that it was a matter for the civil aviation authority and not a matter for my right honourable friend <e> <s> these designated aerodromes are of course the major aerodromes around london <e> <s> a large number of people live around them and it is i think right for example that the members of parliament who represent constituents living around heathrow and gatwick should have the facility of being able to question the minister about the effects of the curfew and about the need for perhaps further restrictions or less restrictions as the case may be <e> <s> the issue of the control of noise around our major airports is a vitally important one especially to the thousands of people who live around them and i think it right that my right honourable friend should retain responsibility <e>", "<cs> i understand and accept that there is concern about the specific case that my noble friend raised <e> <s> there are many detailed considerations about that case on which i wonder whether my noble friend would allow me to write to him because if i could go into that detail with him which is perhaps not an appropriate thing to do on the floor of the chamber he might be convinced <e>", "<cs> just before the committee reaches a decision on this amendment i should like to say that there was one point that i endeavoured to make when my noble friend moved his amendment <e> <s> it was the point that it is not always a major matter of public concern that might cause my right honourable friend to vary or reverse a decision of the authority particularly to vary a decision of the authority <e> <s> there could be an occasion when there was a very minor matter which could in no way be described as a matter of major public concern but which my right honourable friend might seek to correct by way of an appeal decision <e> <s> if he were precluded from doing that by the terms of this amendment i think that that would be a pity <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will not press the amendment <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> i think that the noble lord misunderstands me and i fear that i did not make myself clear <e> <s> there might be circumstances when the parties to the case following the decision of the authority might wish to draw to the secretary of states attention some minor matter which even the authority might agree could be readily corrected by an appeal decision <e> <s> it might be a minor matter <e> <s> i am referring to what must be purely a hypothetical consideration but i should be loath to delete that possibility from the range of facilities available to the secretary of state by agreeing to the amendment <e>", "<cs> this amendment has two aspects to it <e> <s> the first is to make a minor change to the wording of section <e>", "<cs> the appeal procedure is part of the licensing process upon which parliament has decided <e> <s> what the noble earl is proposing is that <e>", "<cs> the amendment on the marshalled list relates to whether or not there should be a public hearing on an appeal procedure <e> <s> i suggest that the question put to me by my noble friend goes rather wider than that but if he would allow me i will write to him on it <e>", "<cs> if i may say so i think the noble earl is under some slight misapprehension as to the licensing procedure <e> <s> parliament has laid down and it has been this way for a good many years certainly way back before the time of the act that any decision of the civil aviation authority or the air transport licensing board as it used to be years ago could be considered on appeal by the minister whether he was the minister of aviation as it used to be or the secretary of state for trade as it now is following a decision of the authority of the day <e> <s> there is no question therefore of revoking existing licences because the licensing procedure is not exhausted until the parties to the case have either lodged their appeal and had the appeal determined or else have decided not to appeal <e> <s> i do not think that the circumstances which the noble earl describes arise in practice <e>", "<cs> i am not making any such assertion <e> <s> i should prefer first to write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i confess that i do not know the answer to what my noble friend has asked me at this moment <e> <s> i think that in any event government-to-government communications are sometimes indeed almost always regarded as confidential <e> <s> i will try to find out what it is if anything that i can say to my noble friend and i will ensure that the noble lord lord george-brown gets a copy of my letter <e>", "<cs> i do not think i introduced the question of representations from the government of hong kong which is what my noble friend refers to <e> <s> i shall consider what further information can be given to noble lords on this matter and if following my letter to my noble friend it is thought appropriate for a written answer to be provided i shall gladly do so <e>", "<cs> the implication of my noble friends question is that my right honourable friend considered some extraneous information contrary to the regulations which is what i am sure is in my noble friends mind <e> <s> of course he did not do that <e>", "<cs> i am in some difficulty on this matter because the point which my noble friend lady trumpington and the noble baroness lady burton have raised is an important one but i am not able to announce any conclusions on it yet <e> <s> i can say that discussions are going on however and i hope that there will be some conclusions to announce within a very short time although i am afraid that i cannot undertake that that will be before this bill completes its passage through the house of lords <e>", "<cs> yes i will certainly undertake to write on both those points but to say more now would breach the confidentiality of the discussions that are going on <e>", "<cs> yes i understand that but i cannot undertake to do that because i shall not be able to write until the discussions to which i have referred are concluded <e> <s> i will try but cannot promise <e>", "<cs> i am sure that will be possible <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to my noble friend for raising that point <e> <s> as my noble friend has described there are two aspects <e> <s> the first is the question of licensing foreign operators in the united kingdom <e> <s> i am speaking from memory on this matter but i recall that the act lays down quite clearly the circumstances under which foreign operators can be licensed in the united kingdom <e> <s> the question which is troubling my noble friend is the skill of the authority in seeing through bogus applications if i can call them that and i am not saying that i know of any particular application which can be so described and in considering any application coming before them of a company purporting to be a british company but which in a certain case might not be so <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter signifies that he would not object to that procedure and i would therefore be very happy to send a copy to my noble friend lord kinnoull <e>", "<cs> this amendment is designed to make a change in the intention of this clause which i must confess to finding somewhat surprising and indeed a little disturbing <e> <s> as your lordships may know this clause was inserted at committee stage in another place and was designed to remedy a shortcoming in section of the civil aviation act which experience over some years had brought to light <e> <s> this had shown that the operation of section has had an inhibiting effect on the disclosure of information which perhaps ought to be revealed in the public interest <e>", "<cs> if i may say so these amendments appear to be the result of a misunderstanding of caa policy with respect to air navigation services at the three london airports <e> <s> for many years the caa has imposed a common rated charge at heathrow gatwick and stansted that is to say the charges are uniform at all three airports <e> <s> this reflects the fact that the caa considers that the air navigation system for londons airports is effectively a single service <e> <s> if the noble lord pauses to think for a moment i feel sure he will accept that proposition <e> <s> the charging policy is therefore designed to ensure that sufficient income is generated to cover costs at all these airports plus allowing a reasonable return on the assets employed <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is quite right in almost everything he said about that <e> <s> the eurocontrol treaty is currently under renegotiation certainly <e> <s> i do not think that the noble lord would expect from me tonight a full and considered reply on all the points which he has raised <e> <s> perhaps i could read what he has said and discuss it with him <e>", "<cs> the amendment would enable the secretary of state to require aerodrome authorities to set up committees to keep the efficiency and the economy of searching and security arrangements under review and to make available such information as he may prescribe to the airline representatives on each committee <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord goes any further he is aware that there is now a legal case in progress on this matter and therefore i hope he will take care in what he says <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i can try to help the noble lord <e> <s> i understand his difficulty and i do not wish to compound his difficulties at all <e> <s> he is trying to put his amendments and i know that my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter is concerned as i am about the fact that the very issue which he is discussing is now the subject of a legal action <e>", "<cs> i absolutely accept what the noble lord says this is a very important matter and i assure him i will deal with it to the best of my ability when and if we find ourselves able to do so at the next stage <e>", "<cs> it may be helpful if i briefly remind your lordships of the purpose of clause <e> <s> the baa were invited to apply for planning permission for a new terminal at stansted airport and in order to place this in context <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend proceeds to press this amendment to the division lobby if that is what he has in mind i would ask him to pause for a moment and reflect precisely on what i said <e> <s> i said that this land could and would if necessary be bought by the british airports authority on the basis of negotiation between a willing buyer and a willing seller <e> <s> for my noble friend to suggest that on that basis the price paid for an equivalent package of land in the outer area would be significantly less than that paid for the same sort of property in the inner area is pure speculation <e> <s> i do not think that that is necessarily going to be the case at all <e> <s> i ask my noble friend to pause and reflect before pressing his amendment <e>", "<cs> the question of compensation and of compensation law is indeed a complex matter <e> <s> i yield to no one in admiration of my noble friends knowledge and expertise in this matter <e> <s> but the question of compensation or compensation law is not the relevant one <e>", "<cs> i said that i yielded to no one in admiration of my noble friend lord kinnoulls knowledge in this matter and i yield to no one in my admiration for the political skill and expertise of the noble lord lord beswick <e> <s> i shall gladly take this away and look at it again but i confess that i do not for the moment see much further way forward <e>", "<cs> my lords the meeting was held to discuss emergency food supply problems in certain african countries <e> <s> britain attended with the aim of supporting efforts to mobilise help within the existing machinery and obtaining up-to-date assessments of need from the international agencies <e> <s> like the community through which most of our food aid is channelled we are now considering what more we can do to help bilaterally to follow up the tonnes of cereals we supplied to needy african countries in the harvest year which has recently ended <e>", "<cs> my lords i think meanness is hardly the word <e> <s> in the current financial year we will have shipped about tonnes of food from the united kingdom <e> <s> we will have paid for tonnes of the community programme and we will have pledged some further tonnes to the world food programme much of which will go to africa <e> <s> as for what the noble lord said earlier about the conference it is true that some of the other donors were able to pledge a certain amount of additional assistance although it is not entirely clear which of that additional assistance came from existing programmes or was new supplies <e> <s> we greatly welcome what they were able to do <e> <s> we on the other hand as the noble lord rightly said are going to consider the matter very carefully to see whether there is anything further that we can do <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that we in this country are net importers of grain for example and any grain that we agree to send overseas has to be replaced by further imports into this country <e>", "<cs> my lords in the current harvest year as it is called we shall be supplying tonnes of wheat or its equivalent in flour to somalia <e>", "<cs> my lords the cuts in the aid programme are a result if i may say so of the totally illusory programme which our predecessors had established before we came to office <e> <s> the vast programme which they had imagined they could fulfil was quite unrealistic <e>", "<cs> my lords that may well be so but if the noble baroness and her friends had remained in office then that programme too would not have been sustained <e>", "<cs> my lords we are doing our bit in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that production in africa generally is less than it should be and that is why our aid programme a programme of technical support and the like is very much aimed at improving agricultural production in africa <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not clear that algeria and the other countries actually promised new food aid <e> <s> some of what was promised was indeed reallocation of existing pledges <e> <s> but we have done our bit as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that it is to your lordships convenience that i intervene now with your lordships approval to make a statement concerning air transport licensing appeals <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for trade has just taken decisions on four appeals from airlines against licensing decisions of the civil aviation authority <e> <s> the first was a request from british caledonian to give them exclusive licences to operate out of gatwick to several destinations which they but not british airways already served <e> <s> in responding to british caledonians appeal submission to the secretary of state the civil aviation authority accepted that it had acted inconsistently and agreed with the appellant that its own decision should be reversed <e> <s> british airways made no representation on the appeal and accordingly my right honourable friend has decided to allow it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords for their reception of this statement <e> <s> i am sorry that it was not all that the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble lord expects me to answer the slightly flippant last supplementary if i may so call it <e> <s> however i confirm that these matters are considered with the very greatest care and i will say again as i said to the noble lord last week that decisions of the authority are overturned or varied only after the most exhaustive consideration of all the facts <e> <s> that indeed was what happened on this occasion <e> <s> it is still the case that the number of appeals which have been allowed in the nine years or so since the passage of the act is very small indeed and that situation will continue <e>", "<cs> my lords we were never opposed to the proposal <e> <s> we have told the mexican authorities who are taking the initiative in organising the meeting that we would be willing to attend <e>", "<cs> my lords as said in my original reply it is not the case that we are opposed to this proposal <e> <s> if we are invited we shall be willing to play a constructive part <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not backsliding we are willing to go and play a constructive part <e>", "<cs> my lords i have heard that view expressed by the noble lord on several occasions but we have to take the situation as we find it today <e> <s> there are a number of very serious difficulties in third world countries as regards which we are anxious to do our best to contribute to a solution <e>", "<cs> my lords the first part of the noble lords supplementary question if i heard him correctly was an assertion that the main burden of the brandt report precisely coincided with views that the noble lord has expressed in this house to me on a number of occasions <e> <s> i submit that that is not strictly accurate <e> <s> it is not necessarily the case that the economy of the developed world would improve hand in hand with the economy of the third world if for example massive funds were available to be injected there <e> <s> but the fact is that we must first restore our own economy to health before we can improve and increase the amount of aid that we can make available to those countries <e> <s> that is an object which is common to both sides of the house even to the noble lord and myself <e>", "<cs> my lords we do of course maintain good and frequent contacts with the agencies to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> as for the earlier part of his supplementary question the austrians have invited a number of foreign ministers but not ourselves to a meeting to be held in vienna in a few weeks time in order to discuss the timing and participation of the summit <e> <s> however we have not actually been invited to that meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords because the initiative has already been taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord over-simplifies the problems which cause a world recession <e> <s> it is not necessarily the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i would refer my noble friend to the series of six-monthly reports to parliament which have been deposited in the library <e> <s> the last of these was made on nd july by my honourable friend in another place mr blaker and a copy was circulated in our <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> the difficulty is that there are a number of misconceptions in the soviet mind <e> <s> the most important one is perhaps that dtente is some divisible thing and you can have dtente for example in europe or so they <e>", "<cs> my lords our delegation to the madrid conference will certainly be fully briefed on such cases <e> <s> whether or not a particular case is raised will have to depend on the circumstances of the meeting but it will certainly be necessary to illustrate violations of the provisions of the final act by reference to specific examples <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the first point about jamming we shall certainly be making our views known on that matter to the soviets as we have done already as for the second point my noble friend raised about the east german minimum exchange requirement we are deeply dismayed by this increase which was announced the other day <e> <s> this is certainly a serious blow to co-operation in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that in the past we have indeed failed to keep these things in perspective <e> <s> we have not attached enough importance to the gravity of the situation in soviet russia and elsewhere <e> <s> it is perhaps worth remembering that since the russians signed the helsinki accord the emigration of jews from the soviet union for example has dropped from a month to a month because they are now applying stricter definitions of kinship and the number of people who have been arrested is now worse than anything under the stalin era <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear not <e> <s> we are extremely disappointed at the slow progress that has so far been made <e> <s> this is because of constant attempts by warsaw pact countries to limit severely the amount of time which should be available for the review of implementation <e> <s> the soviets know i am sure that the western countries cannot accept this but we do still expect the review meeting to open as planned on th november <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the right reverend prelate <e> <s> indeed the right reverend prelate will know of the recent trial among others of father gleb yakunin who was the founder member of the christian committee for the defence of believers in the soviet union and who has been sentenced i hear to five years in a strict rgime and five years internal exile <e> <s> i can assure the right reverend prelate that the government have issued a press statement condemning these trials in all cases <e>", "<cs> my lords i too have seen a number of press reports on that matter but it would be wrong for me i think to comment on their accuracy or otherwise <e> <s> naturally we should deplore any development that led to an extension or escalation of the conflict in the middle east <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i understand that the official talks will open even if there is no agreement at the preliminary meetings <e>", "<cs> my lords there is of course verywidespread parliamentary and other interest in this matter and i have no doubt that many noble lords will question me about progress if no other way is found <e>", "<cs> my lords we have to judge what action to take in these matters by what we think will be in our best interests <e> <s> where we can achieve meaningful agreement with the soviet authorities we shall pursue negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords on the last occasion that i reported to the house on this matter it was done by means of a written answer <e>", "<cs> this amendment concerns a question which was covered exhaustively in another place and on which as the noble lord recognises we have already had some discussion in your lordships house <e> <s> its wording would i think give rise to considerable difficulties in interpretation since i am not aware of any legal standard which would enable the responsibilities of a majority shareholder in relation to the appointment of directors to be determined <e> <s> these are questions of discretion to be exercised by each shareholder as he thinks best <e> <s> therefore i think we would be most unwise to accept the amendment but i hope i can satisfy the noble lord on the nature of the relationship which we envisage between the government and the successor company <e> <s> first let me repeat what has been said before and what i cannot emphasise too strongly <e> <s> the government have no intention whatsoever of controlling the activities of the successor company in the way british airways is at present controlled as a nationalised industry <e> <s> in other words we shall no longer need to approve all the airlines aircraft and equipment purchases and other capital purchases over million <e> <s> we shall no longer place limits on the total amount of investment it may make or on the money it may borrow in any one year <e> <s> we shall no longer need to approve individual borrowings or set a financial target <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may have the leave of the house to make a further observation <e> <s> i will try to illustrate how we see this matter working by reference to what might be a hypothetical situation and certainly is for the moment when for example minority shareholders might seek to appoint directors thought to be unsuitable <e> <s> as i said the normal procedure is for the board of a private sector company to take the initiative in changes of directors and i have explained our position as a shareholder in that context <e> <s> however i acknowledge that for example it is conceivable that a group of minority shareholders might seek to make their own unsuitable nominees for board membership <e> <s> indeed that has been known to happen on occasion in other companies but not very often <e> <s> i could <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise with diffidence and i hope still with the leave of the house to answer that specific point <e> <s> all shareholders have certain rights including if necessary casting their votes at an annual general meeting or an extraordinary general meeting but i must say that the prospect of the government using their votes is likely to conic about only in the most extraordinary circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment is similar in form and substance to the amendments tabled and spoken to by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter and the noble lord lord beswick at the committee stage and the intention is broadly the same even though there are some minor variations in the wording <e> <s> again as at committee stage there is i am afraid the mistaken reference to section instead of section of the act which arising out of the conversations which have taken place this afternoon i imagine that my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter now knows about <e> <s> but i will address myself to what is the substance of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to be able to assure my noble friend that the government are fully alive to the deficiency in existing procedures which was revealed by the recent appeal case to which he has referred <e> <s> it is indeed unsatisfactory that confidential information which is or may be highly relevant to a decision taken by the civil aviation authority should not then be available to the secretary of state on appeal <e> <s> such information where it is pertinent to the decision of an appeal ought to be available to the secretary of state subject of course to appropriate safeguards as to the continued confidentiality of that information <e> <s> this applies whatever may be the issue at stake in the appeal including the one to which my noble friend refers in his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment as the noble lord has explained is similar in purpose to one which he put forward at committee stage <e> <s> let me first acknowledge that the noble lord has gone some way in this latest proposal to meet the objections which i saw in his earlier one <e> <s> but i am sorry to say that i still cannot accept what he proposes <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish first to recognise the statesmanship if that is the right word of the noble lord lord ponsonby in not pursuing his amendments at an earlier stage when a doubt was raised about the <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend raised this matter at the committee stage on th october and i <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration on report be adjourned until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now further considered on report <e>", "<cs> my lords the percentages requested are and respectively <e> <s> there is little doubt that our membership of the european community has contributed significantly to this increase <e> <s> however many other factors such as increasing international specialisation or movements in the price of oil and exchange rates help to determine the geographical pattern of united kingdom exports <e> <s> as to the future her majestys government are unequivocally committed to membership of the community <e> <s> it is not my practice to make forecasts but i certainly hope that exporters will take advantage of opportunities wherever they arise <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is of course quite right <e> <s> perhaps it is also worth remembering that barriers to our trade with community countries have steadily lowered during the period reviewed by the question but if we were to leave the market now or in the near future those would undoubtedly rise again <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord opened his supplementary question by referring to a lowering of tariffs <e> <s> i am not quite sure which tariffs he means <e> <s> if he means the tariffs that are erected by third world countries against our exports then i must tell him that that is not a matter for me <e> <s> but if he is referring to european community or united kingdom tariffs against imports from the third world i should tell him <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is a rather different question <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government consider that the <e>", "<cs> it is indeed a complex and delicate exercise my lords and if i may say so that was a rather complex supplementary but i can give my noble friend the assurances for which he asks <e>", "<cs> my lords did not fully grasp the gist of the noble lords supplementary question but certainly the position needs to be kept under continuous review and the problems arising from competitive countries as the noble lord put it is certainly one that we need to look into <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of the proposals would be to tighten up the scheme against the better off and more competitive beneficiary countries but overall a new scheme would be more liberal <e>", "<cs> my lords the responsibility for such matters lies with the civil aviation authority <e> <s> furnishing materials already used in british passenger-carrying aircraft are required to satisfy the flame resistance specifications laid down in the british civil airworthiness requirements <e> <s> only materials which are not readily flammable and will not of themselves sustain low-level burning can meet these specifications <e> <s> the question of toxic gases is another matter and is more difficult to resolve as all organic materials can produce toxic fumes when burned <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may answer the first point put by the noble lord about the saudi accident at riyadh i would suggest to him that it is a mistake to jump to conclusions about the causes of that accident <e> <s> the authorities there are currently conducting an inquiry and i hope that in due course their report will be made available <e> <s> as for the specific points that the noble lord put subsequently i can assure him that there is a considerable amount of research going on into this matter <e> <s> we hope that the present position which is not too unsatisfactory can be improved in the near future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that british pilots do not need that sort of advice <e> <s> i can tell the noble lord that in fact the passengers were alive in the aircraft for some considerable number of minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords since the goodwill mission in march by representatives of the guinea government a payment towards the arrears of debts due under the debt rescheduling agreement has been received and we understand that further payments may be expected in the near future <e>", "<cs> my lords the release of prisoners and the parallel improvement in the human rights situation is of course to be welcomed wherever and whenever it may occur <e> <s> as to the com <e>", "<cs> my lords that will depend upon a number of factors including progress with the payments under the rescheduled debt agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say at the outset that i fully appreciate the concerns which lie behind this amendment <e> <s> the first is that users should have information on the costs that are being incurred on security and forecasts of developments likely to affect future income and expenditure <e> <s> may i repeat what i said during committee stage and again on report <e> <s> that the department of trade make a great deal of financial information available to the working group on the aviation security fund which includes user representatives and also a representative of the air transport users committee <e> <s> may i by way of example describe a paper which was circulated by the department to the working group about two weeks ago in order to demonstrate how much information is made available <e> <s> the paper sets out total income and expenditure under various headings for last year together with estimates for this year and next <e> <s> costs for last year for each individual airport are given <e> <s> significant variations in manning levels compared with a year previously are noted and all major wage awards over the last year are recorded <e> <s> assumptions regarding future wage awards and manning levels are specified and traffic forecasts are discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e> <s> i believe that in our previous debates we have indeed done proper justice to this important bill <e> <s> although there have been some differences between us i sense a general sympathy for the view that civil aviation is an industry subject to continual development and change and that our attitudes must change with it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to all the noble lords and the noble baroness who have spoken but i am sorry that the two noble lords who sit on the front bench and on the privy councillors bench opposite have not felt able to welcome more warmly the provisions of this bill <e> <s> however i am happy to <e>", "<cs> my lords i was just about to undertake to write to the noble baroness on this issue <e> <s> if she would prefer me to answer a written question for example i should be willing to do that and i will arrange for the noble baroness to be informed when i am ready to give her a substantive reply to any question she may table <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in the hands of the noble baroness and i will answer whatever question she sees fit to table <e>", "<cs> indeed we did my lords but the market conditions at this time are not appropriate and that is why we were obliged to announce that this flotation will not take place in <e> <s> but let the noble lord and your lordships be in no doubt that it is our determination to see that that happens <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that british airways helicopters limited have asked the civil aviation authority not to proceed with the application for the time being and that the operation of the proposed helicopter service is the subject of discussions between the applicant the national air traffic services and the british airports authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i am interested to hear that but the difficulty which is apprehended relates to the route of the helicopter between milton keynes and a suitable site on the airport <e> <s> the problem so far seems to be that this route conflicts with the approach path to the main runways <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that that is a widely held view <e>", "<cs> my lords i can tell my noble friend that that is a matter that we take very seriously <e> <s> an inquiry is being held by the baa and others but i am not yet in a position to make any announcement <e>", "<cs> the construction of a new heliport for example on some site to the north of heathrow would of course have to be subject to the usual planning procedures <e>", "<cs> my lords i think not <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government have often stated that they do not accept the description of swapo in resolutions of the united nations general assembly as the sole and authentic representative of the namibian people <e> <s> successive british governments have either abstained on or voted against resolutions containing such assertions <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the second supplementary falls a bit outside the scope of the question on the order paper <e> <s> as to my noble friends first supplementary i am sorry that my original answer did not make clear that our view is that swapo cannot claim to be the sole representative of the namibian people because in due course that will be for the people of namibia themselves to decide <e> <s> as for when they will get that opportunity we hope it will be soon but of course that remains to be determined with the conclusion of the present negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords i did reply to the final supplementary the noble lord asked me when we could expect elections to take place and i told him that would have to depend upon the result of the present negotiations <e> <s> i also said in my main reply that we have always either abstained on or voted against resolutions which suggest that swapo is the sole legitimate representative of the namibian people <e>", "<cs> my lords a united nations mission was recently in pretoria and we hope that the secretary-generals report arising out of that mission will be put before the security council fairly soon <e>", "<cs> my lords the various military activities taking place to which the noble lord refers are of course a difficulty but so too is the violence coming from other quarters and in particular swapo which form the subject of the question on the order paper <e> <s> as for the general charge of south african <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord talking about black south africans <e> <s> if so i think that is another question <e>", "<cs> the question of who is the sole legitimate voice of the namibian people will have to be determined at an election <e>", "<cs> my lords we agree that there is an urgent need for a solution to this problem but we think that the best way forward is through the implementation of the united nations plan and that is now happening <e> <s> the next stage will be to study the secretary-generals report to the security council which we expect to be received shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords we thought it right to support the asean countries in the recent general assembly votes on cambodia <e> <s> on credentials we were among countries who rejected an attempt by the vietnamese and their friends to amend the unopposed report of the credentials committee <e> <s> i have placed in the library copies of our explanation of vote and of our intervention in the general assembly discussion on the th october <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we did not in any way give our support or add any credence to the pol pot rgime <e> <s> successive british governments have made clear their detestation of the democratic kampuchean rgime in particular at the united nations human rights commission and we neither want nor expect its return to power <e> <s> as for the suggestion of leaving the seat <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right about the conference proposal which was coupled of course with the call for the withdrawal of vietnamese troops and enjoyed over-whelming support <e> <s> we hope that on sober reflection vietnam will decide to take part in an early conference <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure that i follow the gist of the noble lords question which i must say was a bit mysterious <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> we believe that the united nations ad hoc committee on the indian ocean which is already considering a proposal for the indian ocean to be declared a zone of peace is the right place for further consideration of this idea <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall of course give careful consideration to attending any conference which has broad international support <e> <s> but we have to consider the proposal of a zone of peace in the light of a number of criteria perhaps the most important of which is whether it would in fact enhance our security <e>", "<cs> my lords the situation in that part of the world is indeed a dangerous one <e> <s> but the principal threat comes does it not <e> <s> from the russian invasion of afghanistan just a few miles to the north <e>", "<cs> my lords we would of course wish to see this vital area in the world remain stable and independent <e>

<e>", "<cs> my lords we will consider any proposal that enhances the security of the region but i am not sure that that one does <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a fairly profound supplementary <e> <s> my noble friend may well be right <e>", "<cs> quite frankly my lords soviet support of this proposal makes it all the more suspicious <e>", "<cs> my lords before negotiations could begin on freezing military expenditure we would need international agreement on a means of reporting and verifying military budgets <e> <s> the government are supporting work in the united nations to reach such agreement but further progress depends on soviet willingness to co-operate <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not opposing every proposal that comes forward but we have to consider each and every one on its merits principally in the light of whether it will be effective <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i have that information in front of me <e> <s> no formal conclusion has been reached on this matter in any event and any answer i could give would be only an indication of peoples preliminary positions <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is always so well informed on these matters and i bow to what he has to say but the fact is that we still have to consider it in the light of whether or not it would be effective <e>", "<cs> my lords we worked hard at the recent united nations special session to find an acceptable framework for the global negotiations <e> <s> however we were unable to agree on the procedures eventually proposed <e> <s> we judged that they did not sufficiently protect the integrity of the united nations specialised agencies <e> <s> the united states and the federal republic of germany took the same view <e> <s> discussion will shortly resume at the general assembly <e>

<e> <s> that will be on th november <e> <s> but i do not think it would be helpful for me to speculate now on the chances of success <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so all that goes rather wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> but it is true that there is a sponsors meeting in vienna on th and th november to discuss the timing agenda and participation of the north-south summit <e> <s> but the countries attending that meeting are co-sponsors <e>", "<cs> my lords again if i may say so the question of opec aid goes rather wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> but as for the earlier part of the noble lords supplementary <e>", "<cs> my lords we were not asked <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i think that that as the noble lords supplementaries sometimes are is an over-simplification <e>", "<cs> my lords the government encourage british companies with interests in south africa to report under the voluntary european code of conduct and to demonstrate that they are paying their black african employees not less than at the very least the minimum wages determined by the expert bodies producing subsistence data <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason why we do not publish the list is because as my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords it is perhaps worth saying that british companies operating in south africa have a not unsatisfactory record <e> <s> the department of trades summary of reports made under the codes by companies for the months ended th june showed that only per cent <e> <s> of the black african workforce in british companies had been paid wages below the lower level of the subsistence data used <e> <s> we very much hope that the next summary which will be available before long will reveal that the percentage is even smaller or perhaps has even been eliminated <e>", "<cs> my lords the next report will relate to the l months ended th june <e> <s> i cannot say <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that what the noble lord proposes would produce a number of serious difficulties but on the general point of taking power to enforce the code it is worth saying that delicate socio-economic matters of this kind do not readily lend themselves to legal regulation <e> <s> there are serious difficulties about definitions for example of what is a subsistence wage in a particular place <e> <s> indeed to import into the code sanctions for non-compliance would apart from any other consideration require the consent of all our partners in the community <e>", "<cs> my lords the law is complex but in general either an airline or agents selling tickets at an unapproved rate would be committing an offence <e> <s> the detail is set out in paragraphs to of the report of the working party on discounted air fares published in <e> <s> the working party also rightly noted that the best interests of all will be served by encouraging in every way the expansion of legitimate low fares and we are seeking to persuade our european partners for example to allow lower fares to meet the needs of all classes of travellers <e>", "<cs> my lords the fundamental way in which we seek to correct this difficulty is as i said in the main answer by encouraging and promoting a reduction in real terms of air fares right across the board <e> <s> it has in the past proved very difficult to obtain sufficient evidence to secure a conviction in a matter such as this but i cannot say that that will not happen in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness will know there has been a steady decline in real terms if not in cash terms of fare levels recently particularly for example on the north atlantic routes and i do not think it is an exaggeration to say that the heyday of the bucket shops as they are called is over <e> <s> how the bucket shops come by their supply of tickets is not always clear but the airlines for the most part deny that they are responsible <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i think that is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an interesting thought but the fact remains that it is the duty of the courts to try offenders who are properly prosecuted <e>", "<cs> my lords international air fares are agreed between the two governments involved <e> <s> in the case of traffic between the united kingdom and the united states which is governed by the bermuda agreement as it is called a fare provision is included in that agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords the tickets do indeed come from somewhere but i am sorry to say that a good many of them are stolen <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to begin by adding my tribute to the select committee oil science and technology whose sub-committee wrote the report we are now considering <e> <s> looking at the list of distinguished members of that committee

direct his question to them <e>", "<cs> my lords it is indeed the case that investment from private sources in the united kingdom in third world countries is very substantial <e> <s> of course some of

successful businesses to be carried on on the islands themselves but there is very considerable potential both on the islands and in the waters around <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord

the noble lord mentions but that had nothing to do with the undertaking to restore the rights of way which was a valid undertaking and which remains <e> <s> it was done in order to prevent the sale being frustrated altogether because had the caution become effective i understand that the purchasers would not have wished to proceed with the purchase <e>", "<cs> my lords as every noble lord has said your lordships will be grateful to my noble friend lord nugent of guildford for raising this subject which clearly has the interest of a number of your lordships who have taken part in this short debate <e> <s> first i should like to congratulate my noble friend lord aberconway on his splendid maiden speech <e> <s> as he reminded us a maiden speaker is constrained to be uncontroversial in his first intervention in your lordships house and having regard to the very high feelings which have been generated by this matter i think that my noble friend did very well to speak in the moderated tones that he did <e> <s> i understand his strong feelings and indeed the strong feelings of other noble lords on this matter and i hope that i shall be able to set some of your lordships fears at rest during the course of my remarks <e> <s> however i hope that my noble friend who spoke for the first time this afternoon will intervene again in your lordships house soon and often <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble earl will know and as the noble lord lord nugent of guildford will also know the correspondence of administrations prior to the one in which i serve is not available to ministers in this government <e> <s> i can however refer indeed to the letter of rd may to which the noble lord referred and he quoted from that letter and i indeed have a copy of the letter in front of me <e> <s> certainly there was a declaration of intent but a declaration of intent is not the same thing as giving an undertaking <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has said that letter was written in the time of the previous administration and of course i have not seen a copy of it but it sounded to me another declaration of intent which is not the same thing as an undertaking <e>", "<cs> my lords i am advised that my noble friend is not correct and that i am not entitled to see the correspondence of the previous administration <e> <s> in any event i have not seen it <e> <s> nor indeed have my honourable and right honourable friends <e> <s> at the same time it was this governments policy to accelerate the sale of surplus government lands so that the receipts would help as quickly as possible to reduce the public sector borrowing requirement <e> <s> if the sale of the land had had to await the result of the appeal the receipts would have been delayed and there was and is nothing to prevent further planning applications followed by further appeals <e> <s> so the delay could have stretched on indefinitely and there had already been a delay of eight years <e> <s> since as i have said the government were under no obligation to remove the runway before selling the land it was decided to sell the land under the crichel down procedure to the noble earl lord lytton <e> <s> the land was sold at current market value as assessed by the district valuer <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble earl lord lytton acquired the land as my noble friend says the runway was indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords if planning permission had existed which would have authorised the noble earl lord lytton or anyone else to operate wisley as an aerodrome it is of course the case that the price to be paid would have been much higher <e> <s> but if my right honourable friend had waited until the planning appeal had been settled and permission granted for aviation use before selling the aerodrome he would <e>", "<cs> my lords it may well be that officials are entitled to advise an incoming government of undertakings made by the previous administration but as i have been at pains to explain no such undertaking existed in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to make it quite clear that the action of the local authority in entering the caution on the land registry was in our view designed to frustrate the execution of government policy in this matter and that is why we have to deal with it very firmly <e> <s> i also wish to demonstrate by my remarks that some of the suggestions which have been made as to what we should do to restore the rights of way are unreasonable <e>", "<cs> my lords recent discussions with mauritian ministers covered political economic and cultural matters including the subject of diego garcia <e> <s> the government of mauritius know that diego garcia will be ceded to mauritius when it is no longer needed for defence purposes <e> <s> this was confirmed by my right honourable friend the prime minister on the th july in answer to a question in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords the second part of the noble lords supplementary question is i would suggest another question <e> <s> consideration of the proposal to make the indian ocean a zone of peace for example which is one of those proposals currently being canvassed is something we shall be ready to undertake in the right forum but in the context of russian troops encamped in afghanistan just a few hundred miles to the north <e> <s> as to the sovereignty of diego garcia the position is quite clear <e> <s> the united kingdom has full sovereignty over that island <e>", "<cs> my lords the mauritian government are certainly aware of that position and are content with it <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that the security situation in that part of the world requires the availability of diego garcia and its facilities to maintain our security and peace <e> <s> unilaterally to proceed along the lines that the noble lord suggests would be most unwise <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to thank the noble lord lord avebury for his commiserations following my little bump last night and for raising this matter which gives us an opportunity to consider this subject <e> <s> i will answer the second part of the noble lords question first and then return to describe more fully her majestys governments policy towards the territory <e> <s> as your lordships will be aware it has not been the general practice of successive governments to publish documents containing confidential advice other than in the context of the -year rule <e> <s> this applies whether or not they have appeared in the press here or abroad <e> <s> there is no reason to depart from this principle in the present case nor do i intend to comment on the contents of the documents in question <e>", "<cs> my lords the united nations answer may i ask the minister this question did investigation of alleged breaches of the arms embargo which may have enabled south africa to manufacture the mm <e> <s> howitzer <e> <s> following legal proceedings both in the united states and canada the firm concerned and certain individuals connected with it were found guilty and sentenced in accordance with the laws of both countries <e> <s> we have no evidence that south africa has nuclear shells <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a fairly comprehensive supplementary question if i may say so <e> <s> the fact is that the parade showed a number of weapons as the noble lord says but most of them pre-dated the arms embargo and do not therefore i suggest come within the scope of the noble lords question <e> <s> as to the question on the howitzer itself the position is as i described it in my original answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i fancy that that is a trick question <e> <s> as for the arms embargo which is perhaps more precisely what the noble lord meant the government are fully committed to implement the embargo and following on what the noble lord lord brockway said we investigate allegations of any breach of united kingdom law which implements the embargo <e> <s> there is no suggestion of such a breach in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords there are if i may say so many allegations of breaches of this embargo most of which do not bear examination but some do <e> <s> where there is <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords our work in this field consists of bilateral action where we have the power and opportunity and multilateral action principally within the european community to persuade our partners of the need for a more liberal rgime <e> <s> some success has been achieved on the north atlantic to hong kong and to certain destinations in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend asked me a question a week or so ago about the prospect <e>", "<cs> my lords i absolutely agree that the long term if not the medium term solution to this matter is to achieve a proper rgime of lower air fares <e> <s> that is the policy which we are pursuing and that is the area in which we have had some success as i have already described <e> <s> it is not the case that airlines have cheap tickets and high priced tickets to sell <e> <s> the blank ticket which is the document causing the difficulty does not precisely state which fare is to be charged <e> <s> that depends upon the booking arrangements between the travel agent and the passenger <e> <s> as i said on the last occasion when we discussed the matter some tickets have been stolen others are supplied by the airlines in the expectation that they will be used for the correct fare while on the other occasions there is genuine misunderstanding about what the correct fare ought to be <e>", "<cs> my lords the fares between any two points are agreed by international agreement between the two countries concerned <e> <s> it is not open to the british government to lower fares unilaterally on any international route we have to achieve agreement with the other government concerned <e> <s> unfortunately that is not always possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i absolutely agree that the level of fares on very many routes is too high <e> <s> our policy is aimed at securing a lowering of those fares where as i have said they are high <e> <s> as i have also said we have achieved some success in that field <e> <s> in the meantime we have to be certain that the bilateral agreements which we have agreed to are upheld <e>", "<cs> my lords iata is a trade organisation of the airlines concerned <e> <s> my noble friend ought therefore to put his question to the airlines <e>", "<cs> my lords the difficulties on the canadian route result from our failure to persuade the canadian government not necessarily the airlines concerned of the need to reduce fares <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is normally so well informed on these matters that i am surprised she advances that argument <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that fares have to be agreed between the two governments whatever iata says <e>", "<cs> my lords consultations with all interests including the efta countries have now been concluded <e> <s> for supplies of paper and board from efta countries we intend to open duty-free quotas tonnes or per cent <e> <s> larger than this year <e> <s> an order setting out the detailed allocation of the proposed new quotas was laid in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for trade on th december <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but the difficulty is that more than one industry is involved <e> <s> while the paper producing industry is the most important in this context we also have to take into account the interests of the paper consuming industries the printing and publishing industries and also the interests of our trading partners <e>", "<cs> my lords of course it has our support within the limits of what we can do in the consultations which we have recently completed <e>", "<cs> my lords that is another question but i cannot imagine that the firms would do it if it did not make economic sense <e>", "<cs> certainly not my lords <e> <s> as i said earlier when we reach our decision on the size of these quotas we have to take into account the interests of all the parties concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords no invitations have yet been issued <e> <s> but the united kingdom expects to be invited to the meeting and to attend <e>", "<cs> my lords the proposals for a new world economic order include if i understand them aright sweeping away the present economic order and that poses some difficulties <e> <s> as for the change in policy which the noble lord thought he apprehended in the governments present proposals if that is what the noble lord thinks he misunderstood the earlier policy <e>", "<cs> my lords an interesting supplementary but not i think arising from the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the conference is intended to be a summit conference and therefore attended principally by heads of state or heads of government and therefore i cannot say whether mr edward heath will be there <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that is correct at all <e> <s> we have never opposed a summit conference of this nature but we have said and we maintain that the ground for such a conference ought to be carefully prepared <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right in suggesting as i have maintained before that the conference should be carefully prepared <e> <s> that preparatory work is currently being done by the cosponsors <e> <s> we are not one of the co-sponsors but we would certainly hope to be involved in the later stages of this preparatory work <e>", "<cs> quite frankly my lords i am not sure that what the noble lord asks arises out of the question on the order paper or indeed from the subsequent supplementary questions <e> <s> of course our aid is aimed at those most in need of it and that is why so much of it goes to africa <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the parliamentary commissioner consular complaints bill be now read a second time <e> <s> the essential purpose of this bill in the words of the long title is to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am greatly obliged to the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts for his helpful reception of this bill <e> <s> i shall try to deal with as many of the points that he raised as i can <e> <s> if i miss one perhaps he will remind me and i shall endeavour to deal with it in correspondence subsequently <e> <s> the noble lord asked whether the passage of this bill would result in an increased workload on the office of the ombudsman as he is called <e> <s> we do not think that that is necessarily the case <e> <s> of the or so consular cases which are handled every year only ever give rise to a complaint <e> <s> how many of those complaints would eventually find their way to the ombudsman i could not say but i do not think it will be very many and we do not anticipate a substantical increase in the workload of the pca following the passage of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that this is a very arcane matter <e> <s> i shall gladly look into the matter again and if i have in any way misled the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts or your lordships i shall hasten to put the matter right but i do not think that i have <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly undertake to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the international organisations bill be now read a second time <e> <s> this bill has two main objectives <e> <s> the first is to remove those provisions of the international organisations act which discriminate against organisations composed of commonwealth states <e> <s> the act applies only to organisations of which the united kingdom and at least one foreign state are members as commonwealth states are not legally speaking foreign commonwealth organisations cannot at present be accorded privileges and immunities under the act <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> no doubt had the british electorate months ago decided differently it would have been the noble lord not i standing at this box promoting the second reading <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i will now repeat a statement being made by my honourable friend mr parkinson in another place <e> <s> i should say that my noble friend lord tren <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble baroness for that last observation with which of course i wholly concur <e> <s> the noble lord lord ponsonby in his remarks which by and large i also welcome asked about the position of other members of the community <e> <s> following on what i said to the noble baroness may i say to him that our community colleagues have been very understanding about our particular problems and have brought no pressure to bear upon us <e> <s> they are themselves of course subject to increases in imports from the united states in the textiles field <e>", "<cs> my lords one needs to get this matter into perspective <e> <s> in the first months of this year united kingdom exports totalled billion while imports from the united states totalled billion an adverse trade balance of billion of which the textile figure was minute indeed only about million <e>", "<cs> my lords conscious of the growing importance of the west european market which now takes virtually per cent <e> <s> of our exports the department of trade has recently set up an exports to europe branch to promote our exports to western europe including finland <e> <s> the branch will operate on an initiative basis by seeking out export opportunities and bringing them to the attention of prospective united kingdom suppliers <e> <s> it is not intended to replace but rather to complement the botbs well-established range of export services given in response to particular inquiries <e>", "<cs> my lords i wholeheartedly agree with the first point which my noble friend made about visits to finland <e> <s> it is certainly the case that in our opinion british businessmen do not fully appreciate the opportunities that are available there and we hope that they will visit finland more frequently when perhaps they will become aware of the very considerable opportunities that are open to them in that country <e> <s> as for a britain in finland year that is an excellent idea which i shall ensure is considered at the appropriate level <e> <s> it is of course the case that finland is a most important ally in both commercial and political ways <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that there is an arrangement such as the noble lord describes as exists with certain other countries <e> <s> of course finland is a member of efta which does not apply in the other case and the european community has a special relationship with efta as the noble lord will know <e> <s> however i shall certainly bear in mind what the noble lord says and ensure that it is considered at an appropriate level <e>", "<cs> my lords no recent cases have been drawn to the attention of the government <e> <s> the department of trade is always ready to examine specific problems and take them up with the japanese authorities as appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right in what he says <e> <s> there is an imbalance of trade with japan which so far this year has amounted to nearly million <e> <s> there are tariff barriers in respect of whisky and confectionery and indeed certain other products as my noble friend said and a number of non-tariff barriers which cause us certain concern for example on standards relating to pharmaceuticals <e> <s> as my noble friend also said the trade imbalance is in the main created by cars and consumer electronics <e>", "<cs> my lords first i wish to thank the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts for keeping his remarks so commendably short at this rather awkward moment when the time is running out <e> <s> the noble lord lord ritchie-calder has done your lordships another valuable service in providing this opportunity to take stock of the activities of the institutions within the united nations system <e> <s> many of your lordships having achieved distinction in the professions or in diplomacy have close knowledge of the work of one or other of the organisations that we have been considering today <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make a personal statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> the object of this short essentially technical bill is to enable the united kingdom to ratify protocols to two international conventions in the maritime field <e> <s> the first of these conventions is the international convention relating to the limitation of the liability of owners of seagoing ships <e> <s> it establishes overall global limits to shipowners liability according to the size of ship involved in respect of claims rising from maritime incidents <e> <s> the legislation implementing this convention in the united kingdom is the merchant shipping liability of shipowners and others act <e>", "<cs> my lords i am greatly obliged to the noble lord for that welcome to the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i might say with permission that my noble friend lord belstead who is to take the next business is temporarily not in his place <e> <s> i fear therefore that i must ask your lordships to adjourn for a few moments to enable him to get here <e> <s> i therefore beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure for five minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there were even more proposals along the lines that the noble lord describes than the three that he referred to <e> <s> romania and sweden also made certain proposals in this connection <e> <s> as for his suggestion that the first half of the conference was one of criticism it was hardly our fault if that is what took place <e> <s> what really happened in madrid was a review of the implementation of the final act by all the participating states and i am afraid that it was necessary for us to criticise in fairly forthright terms the implementation of the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords again may i thank the noble lord for his kind words <e> <s> the noble lord is quite right these proposals should not cut across initiatives being taken elsewhere <e> <s> of course what were being discussed in madrid were the measures flowing directly from the helsinki final accord and that is quite separate from the mbfr talks in vienna and the disarmament talks in geneva <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the helsinki final accord deals with matters much wider than just disarmament <e> <s> there are all sorts of provisions in relation to human rights and other matters all of which are being considered in madrid <e> <s> the disarmament proposals that we are referring to now form just a small part of the total helsinki package if i can call it that <e> <s> i have referred to the specific proposals of france and the other countries which we shall develop and pursue but of course our main disarmament fora are elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords we are somewhat selective in the specific cases which we raise with the soviet union of those people such as dr shcharansky whose unfortunate plight is drawn to our attention <e> <s> in general terms we have most certainly drawn the soviets attention to the appalling decline in the number of jews who have been granted exit permits from the soviet union in recent months <e> <s> but as i say on <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that dtente as they say is not divisible and it seems difficult to imagine how meaningful progress can be made on measures proposed which relate perhaps specifically to europe while the soviet union remains encamped in afghanistan <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that goes rather wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> but it is certainly the case that we need to maintain a credible defence posture if we are to have any kind of success in disarmament negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have details of the maltese proposal in front of me but like all other proposals we shall wish to consider that one in the context of what is necessary to maintain our security <e> <s> that does not mean that we will not look at the proposal with care and urgency <e> <s> but it is also true as the noble lord said that the next phase of the meeting in madrid will be to consider the proposals that have been put forward including in particular of course the french proposal which is referred to in the question <e>", "<cs> my lords as i think <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear not <e> <s> perhaps i should first thank the noble baroness for the mailed fist in the velvet glove which she has offered to me at the start of her remarks <e> <s> to deal with her supplementary question i certainly agree that there is considerable economic pressure from passengers and from airlines for different reasons for lower air fares <e> <s> we believe that in very many cases air fares ought to be lower and we are seeking to achieve that by means of negotiation where we can with our international partners <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that we are at <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is mistaken to say that what i was saying was rubbish because it is not <e> <s> the fact is that and i have made this clear to the noble baroness before and i will make it clear to your lordships again now because i know that many of your lordships are interested in this matter international fares are agreed between governments <e> <s> authority granted to airlines of either country to operate their services is conditional upon their adhering to the terms of the permits issued and one of those terms is the fares to be charged <e> <s> if they fail deliberately to charge the agreed fares they are in breach of the permits that have been issued to them <e>", "<cs> my lords the legal position is not clear <e> <s> i must tell the noble lord that if we had been able to secure the necessary evidence in recent months we should have instituted prosecutions <e> <s> if the appropriate evidence comes before me in the months to come i shall authorise the introduction of prosecutions <e>", "<cs> my lords i might perhaps add to what my noble friend has said that there may be steps i can take which fall short of prosecution and i shall consider what might be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i have heard that view advanced and i have no doubt that it is a just one <e>", "<cs> my lords there are of course a number of legitimate low fares for example standby fares on the north atlantic which doubtless are among those offered by the so-called bucket shops <e> <s> it is also the case that a number of tickets are sold by bucket shops where the conditions that should be attached to the fare are not applied or where blatantly the wrong fare is applied <e> <s> those are the matters with which i am concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of that <e> <s> the general pressure for lower fares is one which i accept and acknowledge but it has to be done through the legitimate channels <e>", "<cs> my lords i will read the answer again with pleasure <e> <s> i said that as i have explained to the noble baroness on several occasions the solution to this problem lies elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords the legal position is very far from clear in this matter and there are additional difficulties about obtaining the necessary evidence but if the noble baroness will cast her mind back to last week when i answered an earlier question from her on this matter she will recall that i declared my determination to see that the law in this matter is properly upheld <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are not concerned they are not attending that meeting <e> <s> as for the precise legal position which the noble baroness put to me earlier i think i would be unwise to offer your lordships a considered legal opinion on this very complex subject at any rate at question time <e>", "<cs> my lords i would welcome a debate of that nature <e> <s> i notice that the noble baroness has entered the ballot for a short debate to be held soon and that will certainly give me an opportunity to expand in more detail on our policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i absolutely agree with my noble friend that the present situation is highly unsatisfactory and i am moving to do what i can to resolve it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly the case that the report to be received in february will be of a preliminary nature <e> <s> i cannot promise that the matter can be resolved as early as march but i know that the officials concerned are well aware of the need for urgency <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord over-states the position somewhat <e> <s> on the point of subsidy we understand that the new american administration plan to deregulate oil prices and that will certainly have an effect in this area because that is of course an essential feedstock in this industry <e> <s> also penetration of the british carpet industry by the american carpet manufacturers is not as great as some people have supposed <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord in his earlier remarks reflected the governments position precisely <e> <s> we certainly do not seek any form of protection in this matter but we do seek to correct any situation where unfair competition appears to arise <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that there is a considerable degree of urgency in this matter but we certainly have no power to act unilaterally with the united states which is what i think the noble lord was suggesting <e> <s> it is perhaps worth getting this matter in context particularly in relation to carpets which the noble lord and another noble lord mentioned <e> <s> imports of man-made fibre tufted carpets from the united states in the first months of last year amounted to million square metres representing an import penetration of only per cent <e> <s> this is only slightly higher than the import penetration at the end of and it was on that basis that our application for quotas last year was rejected by the community <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i understand the deregulation is likely to occur even sooner than my noble friend suggests in fact this very day so i am informed <e> <s> on the question of the percentage there is some difference of opinion between ourselves and the united states authorities on this matter but our calculation is that their energy policies result in a price advantage of between and per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords the decision in the council of ministers to take action in this matter was made on th december <e> <s> since then as the noble lord will know there has been a change of administration in the united states and officials are expecting to resume discussions just two weeks from now <e> <s> i do not think that that is a bad record <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier her majestys government cannot act by themselves in this matter <e> <s> we have to act through the european community <e> <s> but in the short time that i have been working both in the foreign office and more recently in the department of trade i have come to realise what a great deal of preparatory work is necessary for these negotiations to be successful <e>", "<cs> my lords the prospect of the widespread or even the limited use of chemical weapons is of course an appalling one as the noble lord has said <e> <s> but in considering our reaction to reports of manufacture of these facilities elsewhere we do of course need to bear in mind that the soviet union has a massive capability in this field <e>", "<cs> my lords it is indeed the case that since i think there have been bilateral talks between the soviet union and the united states on this matter and that indeed the draft convention put forward by i think the noble lord himself is with them to assist them in their discussions <e> <s> these bilateral discussions which have taken place since have progressed very slowly largely due to soviet refusal to allow adequate verification <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a view but we certainly have no plans at present to acquire chemical weapons or the capability to produce them or indeed to base them in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> the biological convention is of course now in force <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the house would wish me to go into the detail of our defensive dispositions in this matter but i can assure the noble lord that we have the matter very much in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords as it happens i think that a convention is already in force prohibiting the use of chemical weapons and dates back to <e> <s> the ownership and manufacture of these weapons is the matter that is currently under discussion and i have no doubt that the point raised by my noble friend will form part of any convention that is eventually agreed <e>", "<cs> my lords i happen to think that such a convention without adequate verification procedures would be virtually useless <e> <s> that is the line that we must pursue in these negotiations <e> <s> the arguments about the difficulties of verification put forward by the noble lord are the sort of arguments that we hear from the soviet union too often <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is of course quite right <e> <s> we shall continue to press the soviet union to accept proper verification measures in geneva and elsewhere <e>", "<cs> i cannot answer for the views of the junta in el salvador my lords but to pick one of the nuggets from the noble lords supplementary to do with the opposition parties in that country and particularly the salvadorean fdr as they are called while that organisation indeed includes respectable politicians it also embraces groups dedicated to violence and kidnappings and included among the victims are united kingdom businessmen <e> <s> the aim of those groups appears to be to precipitate a civil war as a means of ousting the present government <e> <s> our policy is to recognise states not governments and the question therefore of officially recognising opposition parties does not arise <e>", "<cs> my lords the right reverend prelate began his supplementary question by reference to the killings which he said had been perpetrated by the junta in power in that country <e> <s> it is certainly the case that there has been a great deal of violence in that country but it has not all come from the government side <e> <s> as for the united states action they have said that they resumed military aid to el salvador because there is foreign intervention in that country in support of the guerrilla forces opposed to the government <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that the position in el salvador gives rise to very great concern and it is of course also true that various churches there have suffered cruelly in the violence which has taken place <e> <s> the noble lord referred to the death of archbishop romero <e> <s> i in fact attended the memorial service to the archbishop in london on behalf of my noble friend the foreign and commonwealth secretary and i am therefore well aware of the very real and justified feeling and of the revulsion which surrounded the tragic death of that prelate <e> <s> but on the general question of aid for that country we have to decide our policies in that area according to the position as we find it and i am happy that the present arrangements are appropriate in the present circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot of course forecast in detail what my right honourable friend the prime minister will discuss with the american president when she meets him but i can assure the noble lord that the affairs of the central american region will be very much in the mind of my right honourable friend and indeed my noble friend the foreign and commonwealth secretary in their consultations with the american government <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that it is already on the agenda of the united nations human rights commission who are i think meeting in a few days time <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can answer the noble baroness in two ways <e> <s> first on the question of the refugees we understand in fact we know that the international committee of the red cross are mounting an appeal for the refugees from el salvador <e> <s> details of that appeal reached the government only yesterday i think and we are urgently considering what response we can make <e> <s> but on the general question of development aid i have to say that all the technical co-operation officers who were the principal feature of our aid programme in that country had perforce to be withdrawn when the embassy was closed in february of last year <e> <s> our present commitments are limited first to the completion of the training of salvadoreans in the united kingdom and secondly <e> <s> to the financing of a second instalment of about for tools and equipment for self-help housing <e> <s> i am sorry to say that local conditions which the noble baroness will understand i am sure have caused considerable delay in the disbursement of the first instalment and it is not therefore certain when we shall be able to disburse the second instalment <e>", "<cs> my lords the united nations human rights commission is meeting as the noble and learned lord lord gardiner indicated very soon in fact i see from my notes on nd february so it is now already in session <e> <s> it will complete its meeting on th march and i understand that it will then be for the salvadorean government to indicate whether they will accept a mission or whatever is decided upon from the united nations human rights commission and we shall have to see what to do in those circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords mr adams is a maltese citizen who was tried under swiss law in respect of information he was alleged to have given to the european community commission <e> <s> the british government have no direct locus to intervene <e> <s> but our permanent representation in brussels have discussed the case informally with the commission with

think that his supplementary question was a mixture of conjecture and his own opinion <e> <s> the fact is that almost everything that the noble lord has mentioned was a reference to the swiss legal system for which i am not responsible <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the european commission on human rights has its doors open to any citizen of europe or any citizen of a signatory state to make representations to it which is doubtless what mr adams will seek to do <e> <s> but it is no part of my job to comment on how that commission should go about its work <e>", "<cs> my lords if there were any miscarriage of justice and i would not comment on that it occured in switzerland and not in brussels <e>", "<cs> my lords i am wary about taking on board the moral duties which the noble lord suggests <e> <s> the duty that i have at this moment is to answer for her majestys government and that i have done <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i can answer for the european commission on the sort of point that the noble lord puts to me but as i said in my original answer our permanent representatives in brussels have discussed the matter informally with the commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to amend the law relating to companies and business names <e> <s> i beg to move that the bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords the aviation security fund to which the noble baroness refers is one of the matters i am looking into carefully <e> <s> i should not wish to be tied to making a statement when i have considered the implications of this matter but i would be willing to answer a question perhaps for written answer when the moment comes <e>", "<cs> my lords the nature and timing of questions tabled by members of your lordships house is not a matter for me <e> <s> i shall be glad to answer the noble baronesss questions as best i can whenever she tables them <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i could start to pull some of the threads of this debate together by adding my thoughts on the tragic death of my noble friend lord amory with a story that he told me a year or so ago <e> <s> it was about the time i think it must have been around when he was appointed as a minister of state by the then mr winston churchill <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a detail point on which if the noble lord will allow me i will write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords the difficulty is that whatever the trading position of the nationalised industry at the present time the money still has to come from the public purse or at least be counted against the psbr and that is the figure that we are endeavouring to contain <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that the net result on the enterprise itself is very different but the net result on public borrowing requirement is the same and that is what we are seeking to control <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a matter of long tradition and the fact is that the doctrine i have enunciated this evening is not a new one it is one which applied equally in the time of the earlier administration <e> <s> the truth of the matter of course is that lenders lend with considerably more alacrity to bodies like the post office in the sure knowledge that if anything went wrong the government would stand behind that particular loan <e> <s> the noble lord suggests that the post office would never renege on its commitments <e> <s> i have no doubt that that is true but in the back of the mind of the lender is standing the security of the british government and that is where the difference lies <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend overstates the position slightly <e> <s> certainly there is room for improvement in british airways but in recent years there has been just that <e> <s> i can give my noble friend sonic figures <e> <s> for example in output per employee was per cent <e> <s> better than the level which in turn was per cent <e> <s> better than the level <e> <s> i could give my noble friend further figures along the same lines but that might unduly weary the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot pretend that all is necessarily perfect with british airways indeed it is not <e> <s> there is still room for improvement as i have said but in looking at the surveys that are made one must consider carefully whether those who carry out the surveys are comparing like with like <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know who the gentleman is to whom the noble lord refers but perhaps a better course would have been for him to join british airways and try to put it right <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord to a very great extent <e> <s> in technical terms british airways is in my opinion the best in the world <e> <s> on the other hand with regard to the question of overmanning which several noble lords and noble baronesses have raised the british airways management is itself on record as saying that there is room for improvement and that is what it is striving to achieve <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the latter point my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> certainly sir ross stainton who has recently retired as chairman of british airways had a most distinguished record with the airline in particular in recent years when he was chairman and he has undoubtedly achieved considerable reduction in the manning levels to which my noble friend referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already referred to the decline in manning levels in british airways in the last year or so <e> <s> in fact the peak to which my noble friend referred was reached some years earlier than he suggested and figures have been significantly below that level in recent years <e> <s> i have already studied the charts to which my noble friend referred but i shall ensure that i refresh my memory on them before the debate which we are to have on i think th february <e> <s> on the question of punctuality raised by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter a few moments ago i would say that i believe that my noble friend lord kimberley has put down a question on that precise point and it is to be answered the week after next <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords but of course only a small percentage of british airways passengers are british people and for the others patriotism may go in a different direction <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we in the government have to judge british airways not only by its competitiveness and efficiency which we do but also by its financial results which like those of other airlines are at present not as good as they might be <e> <s> however we are to have a debate on this matter in a week or so and perhaps it would now be appropriate to move on <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think the united nations could have endorsed this proposal in because it was not in fact made until <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord is rushing me on a bit <e> <s> i would prefer to wait for the report of the committee of experts before taking this matter the further several stages which the noble lord suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the note in front of me but i recall i think that the report of the group of experts is expected before the end of this year <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord as always is very well informed in these matters and i feel sure he is right <e>", "<cs> my lords it is too early to say who will contribute to the costs of this project but i can say that the report of the group of experts will include an estimate of the likely costs <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true of course that many of the satellites circling our earth are in fact spent and now serve no useful purpose <e> <s> as for the noble viscounts earlier point as to the percentage of satellites used for military or civilian purposes again i do not have the precise figures in front of me but i should perhaps say that many satellites like some communications satellites for example in fact serve both military and civilian purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is suggesting that the united kingdom should do more as i think he is then i should tell him that our record is a very good one <e> <s> we have pledged million for which is in itself a per cent <e> <s> increase over <e> <s> we also contribute through our one-fifth share of the european communities contribution which in stood at million <e> <s> we are thus the second largest contributor over the -year period of unrwas existence <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords <e> <s> we acknowledge that some of our european partners contribute less than the united kingdom <e> <s> we hope they will respond sympathetically to the commissioner-generals appeal for funds <e> <s> but we think of course that prime responsibility rests with the arabs <e>", "<cs> so far as i know none my lords <e>", "<cs> my information is that rather more money than that is required certainly if the sub-stantial closures foreshadowed by the commissioner-general are to be avoided <e> <s> we shall certainly do our best to persuade our colleagues at the committee to which i referred to take this matter very seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble baroness is necessarily wrong in the figures to which she has referred but i cannot hide from your lordships the gravity with which we face this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is referring to the advantages other than the purely financial considerations to which i have referred then i feel sure that those will in the first instance in any event be matters which the select committee which is currently considering the matter will want to take very carefully into consideration <e> <s> i wish to say quite clearly that the government will not reach any premature decision in this matter and certainly not before they have had a chance to consider and study the report being prepared by the select committee in the other place <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me to suggest how the select committee should conduct its affairs but i understand that we expect to receive a report from it in about three months time <e>", "<cs> my lords our policy in this matter has two important strains <e> <s> on the one hand there is our commitment to the territory which has been announced before today from this box and i confirm it again now and on the other there are our excellent relations with the peoples republic of china <e> <s> we have no doubt that this matter will be resolved in good time <e>", "<cs> my lords it is of course important to ensure that the confidence of the business community and others in hong kong is maintained <e> <s> therefore it is i am sure desirable that this matter should be resolved well in advance of the expiry of the lease and i have no doubt that it will be <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords <e> <s> there is no doubt that the peoples republic of china derive very considerable benefit for example in terms of foreign exchange earnings from the present arrangements with regard to the territory and i can say that they are certainly well aware of our views which i do not think depart very far from theirs <e>", "<cs> my lords the government support the proposal for a conference on disarmament in europe tabled at the madrid csce review meeting on th december by france <e> <s> we shall be working with our allies for the adoption of this proposal which would open the way for confidence-building measures applying to the whole of europe <e>", "<cs> my lords the french proposal envisages initially negotiations on militarily significant verifiable and binding confidence-building measures to which the noble lord refers applying to the whole of europe that is to say from the atlantic to the urals <e> <s> the results of this initial stage of the conference would be submitted to the next csce follow-up meeting which would examine in the light of the progress how efforts towards security and disarmament in europe should be continued <e> <s> it is true to say that there are a number of other proposals for conferences of one sort or another put forward by for example poland romania yugoslavia and sweden <e> <s> some of them however have some shortcomings <e> <s> in particular some of them do not go farther east than germany itself leaving the area adjacent to the border but inside the soviet union unaffected <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords <e> <s> that is quite correct <e> <s> the french proposal is of course within the context of the helsinki final agreement and the csce process and does not of itself envisage in the first phase anyway specific disarmament measures <e>", "<cs> my lords the attitude of the new united states administration in this matter has yet to be determined <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord has an unduly gloomy view of relations between the united kingdom and france <e> <s> certainly we have our disagreements on matters but they are within the context of our joint membership with the others of the european community and i have no doubt that these little difficulties will be resolved in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that it is beyond my power to ensure that the united states government participate in these matters <e> <s> they have we understand not yet taken up a formal position on this proposal but we hope that they will and that they support it <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to intervene during my noble friends speech but i mentioned earlier that this matter is now very much <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot immediately spot the difference between the two things which the noble lord has put to me <e> <s> perhaps i may read a short sentence with your lordships permission which i was planning to use later in winding-up <e> <s> i understand that in open court this morning mr justice parker granted an injunction to the british airports authority against air canada and the other airlines which have been withholding a proportion of the landing charges for the use of heathrow airport pending trial of the main legal action which has now been fixed for january <e> <s> therefore i am advised that it would not be appropriate for me or other members of your lordships house to comment in any way on this decision or the contents of the main legal case to be heard next january <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to intervene again but that is the core of the case which is to be put before the court next january <e>", "<cs> my lords he is not here <e> <s> i hope noble lords will forgive me for intervening once more <e> <s> i apologise for pressing this point <e> <s> i want to emphasise that i have no desire to stifle the discussion of this or any other matter in your lordships house unless there is a clear danger under the <e>", "<cs> my lords it is all there <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise yet again for intervening <e> <s> if i may say so i think my noble friend has got it just right the level of landing fees ought not to be discussed <e> <s> i feel certain that the risk of straying into the area of the legal proceedings if we do discuss the level of landing charges is very great indeed <e> <s> therefore i hope your lordships will agree that it would not be appropriate to discuss the level of charges in your lordships house this afternoon <e> <s> another matter that is to come before the court is whether my right honourable friend the secretary of state has the power to impose certain financial duties upon the british airports authority and thus comment upon that matter too might be inappropriate <e>", "<cs> quite right too <e> <s> this is very dangerous ground <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to start if i may by apologising to my noble friend lord gisborough and to my noble friend lady trumpington for the repeated interruptions of myself and my noble friend lord sandys on the vexed <e>", "<cs> my lords the costs of the security operations at both baa airports and indeed at some others have been kept under review for a long time <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend that the present arrangements of which of course future pensions play a part are kept under consideration and we are convinced that the present arrangements are the most cost-effective that can be devised <e> <s> it is necessary of course for us to ensure that the effectiveness of the security arrangements remains unimpaired <e> <s> that is one of the reasons why we have the arrangements which are presently in force <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not finished yet <e>", "<cs> my lords i said i have not finished yet <e> <s> on the bilateral side we cannot unilaterally introduce lower fares but we can and do disapprove fare increases where we believe that they are unreasonable <e> <s> for example the normal economy return fare to rome would be over higher now if we had not taken such action and to stockholm nearly <e>", "<cs> my lords britain is not a member of iata iata is an organisation of airlines <e> <s> the british airlines british airways and british caledonian are themselves members of iata and they are as aware of this problem as we are and as the noble baroness is <e> <s> iata like other bodies has to proceed with some form of consensus and it is some of the other airlines in iata which are obstructing what we think <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord could face this way we would be able to hear him a little better <e> <s> his voice is not reaching the microphone <e>", "<cs> my lords the question tabled by the noble lord lord byers refers to the impact of the eec initiatives on other peace efforts and relationships <e> <s> before addressing his question directly it may be helpful if i say something about the background to current european diplomatic efforts a description which i believe applies more accurately to the current state of play than the word initiatives <e>", "<cs> my lords the provisions to which i have referred apply to the dependencies of all the member countries of the european community and it would be difficult i think to apply different criteria to one dependency of one member state as compared with another dependency of another member state <e> <s> but i can confirm to my noble friend that broadly speaking the allocation is dependent upon population and gnp <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot say whether the funds will be used for the specific purpose to which my noble friend refers but i can say that under the previous decision in the sum which the falkland islands received was currency units which was then equivalent to about and i imagine that the allocation under this latest decision will be of the same order <e>", "<cs> my lords that supplementary question falls slightly wide of the question on the order paper but certainly my noble friend is correct in saying that if such discoveries have been made and i know that the auguries are good then of course that would have a most beneficial effect on the economic position of the falkland islands but it would be difficult to realise and appreciate that advantage and gain the benefits of it while the present dispute with the argentinians continues <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will appreciate the dispute of course is one between the <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have endeavoured to make clear not only today but on earlier occasions when noble lords have asked me about these matters the solutions to the economic problems which beset the falkland islands are to be found in an agreement with the argentinians when the various threats which have been uttered by both sides and indeed the islanders themselves are brought to an end and all the resources around the islands including the oil resources if there are any and of course the fish resources to which the noble lord lord shackleton has drawn attention on several occasions can be developed and used to the benefit of all concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords what i cannot do is prejudge the outcome of the negotiations between the united kingdom government and the argentinian government in this matter except to say that those negotiations are being conducted with the knowledge and agreement of the falkland islanders themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak without a specific note on that point but as i understand it that is the present position <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have repeatedly said and as i say again now the long-term solution to the economic problems of the falkland islanders is the resolution of the dispute with the argentinian government and that we are working to achieve <e>", "<cs> my lords that of course is correct what the noble lord has mentioned are important elements in the equation which we hope will in due course lead to a solution to this matter <e> <s> but in the meantime as i have repeatedly said and as i say again the position is that a solution must be found to our dispute with the argentinians if a way forward for the long term is to be found <e>", "<cs> my lords hong kong is frequently described as unique <e> <s> it has been said tonight and so <e>", "<cs> partly my lords <e>", "<cs> it is not <e>", "<cs> my lords as i say we do not know of any particular cases to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> as i said in my answer the problem would arise if these kits were supplied without the necessary face shields <e>", "<cs> my lords the bulwarks of protectionism to which i referred have been erected by the international community not by me <e> <s> it is therefore for the international community to pull them down <e> <s> i hope that it will soon do so <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness means that i should authorise the sale of tickets at fares other than those found in the international agreements and agreed with our international partners in other words in clear breach of the international agreements into which we have entered then i must disagree with her <e>", "<cs> my lords an international agreement is the law as i understand it and therefore tickets which are sold at other than the fares agreed with our international partners or without the conditions that we have authorised are themselves sold in breach of the law <e> <s> as i have told my noble friend and indeed the noble baroness lady burton several times although there is clearly a breach of the law on these occasions it is a very complex and technical matter and it is not one that would be easy to persuade a court on <e>", "<cs> my lords i am mystified as to how the noble lord arrives at that conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure who the noble lord thinks is misguided in this matter <e> <s> when these international agreements were arrived at in some cases very many years ago they were considered right and proper at that time and we of course agreed to them <e> <s> the situation has changed radically in the past or years particularly more recently and that is why we now seek to change these agreements <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i have not got that last figure in front of me but on the noble baronesss other point i can say that the government have now contributed over to the british voluntary agencies for relief work in uganda <e> <s> of that was given to the disasters emergency committee to be used principally for food medicines and transport <e> <s> we have also made a grant of to assist the save the children fund food transport operations in karamoja <e> <s> in addition this is not quite what my noble friend asked me but perhaps it will be helpful the united kingdoms share of european community emergency aid amounts to a further <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first point put to me by the noble lord we shall of course support any proposal to improve the arrangements for the response to these situations <e> <s> on the second point such an organisation already exists i would suggest in the united nations disaster relief organisation whose primary concern is to co-ordinate the response to sudden natural disasters and other emergencies <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the first of the noble lords points there were about million people at least in the horn of africa who were thought to be at risk and very nearly half those have certainly been relieved of the worst excesses of their plight <e> <s> on the noble lords second point we are considering urgently whether there is anything further we can do in the very short term and an announcement is expected to be made shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot believe that that is a serious supplementary but if it is i would want to say that the record of success of the united nations in the matter we are discussing this afternoon is a very fine one <e>", "<cs> my lords the availability of a clean water supply is a vital feature of the development programmes of many of these areas and it is certainly uppermost in the minds of those involved with the british aid programme <e>", "<cs> my lords the united nations disaster relief organisation is primarily concerned as i said earlier to co-ordinate the response to sudden natural disasters but it does become involved in longer-term emergency needs such as this one when it is specifically requested to do so by the un secretary-general <e> <s> we think it is doing a good job so far <e>", "<cs> my lords following on from the answer i gave to the noble lord lord paget it is certainly the case that we support the united nations in projects of this kind and things would be very much easier if other countries would give as much money as we do <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend lady hornsby-smith put her finger on the problem when she referred to the water supply in this part of the world <e> <s> certainly the lack of water is what seems to be the cause of so many droughts <e>", "<cs> my lords i would certainly agree with both of those points <e> <s> we certainly look forward to playing our part in the consultations in july to which i referred <e> <s> we are also considering as i said earlier what we can do urgently in the short-term <e>", "<cs> my lords the problems of karamoja apart from the climatic problems to which i referred earlier stem from the long years of the amin rgime in that country <e> <s> i cannot think that the problems will be solved overnight but we shall certainly be ready to play our part <e>", "<cs> my lords the international air transport association is a trade association of airlines <e> <s> member airlines are entitled to make such proposals to the association as they wish <e> <s> her majestys governments prior approval is not necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i would say to all that that the noble baroness is a little confused in her mind <e> <s> so far as the adoption of iata recommendations and the subsequent approval of her majestys government are concerned the question of whether or not we would have to approve such a recommendation would depend upon what that recommendation was and whether it affected our international agreements to which i referred at some length yesterday <e> <s> as for iata suggesting the cure to the problem which the noble baroness has brought to my attention on so many occasions the long-term cure to that problem as i have said to her on i think each and every one of those occasions is that we persuade our international partners to agree to a more competitive and realistic regime of air fares <e>", "<cs> my lords the recommendation from iata for a new rgime of air fares particularly on the european routes is one that i have no doubt the government would hasten to approve <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are not a member of iata <e> <s> we have no power to call a meeting of iata as my noble friend suggests <e> <s> that is for the member airlines to do british airways for example as a member of iata is entitled to do that and indeed does but the problem is that once a meeting of iata is called for any conclusion to be effective <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i cannot be precise my lords but i can tell the noble baroness that it will not be very long <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have not decided what form this document should take and how it should be published but whatever we decide i have no doubt the noble baroness will find a way of raising it in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with my noble friend that it is vital that nationalised industries should be made aware in the most effective way possible of the views of their consumers <e> <s> it was with a view to improving arrangements for this that this inquiry was originally set in train <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> may i first deal with the amendment which the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran has moved and then come to the more general point of the register itself which really hes at the heart of the noble lords amendment <e> <s> the amendment itself would involve an enormous extension of the controls on names which have been applied in the past under the companies acts and the registration of business names act <e> <s> it has never been unlawful nor indeed has it ever been considered undesirable to allow a company to be registered by the name of an unincorporated business <e> <s> the index which the registrar maintains at present and against which the names of new companies are checked includes about entries covering the names of those bodies which it is proposed in future to cover in the statutory index <e> <s> this index has never included business names registered under the registration of business names act of which there are now some <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is no doubt quite right <e> <s> the present level of staff could be covered in terms of cost by increasing the fee to or whatever the figure may be <e> <s> what i have endeavoured to explain is that the present level of staff is wholly inadequate for the purpose which we see as being contained in the thoughts of the opposition in this matter <e> <s> they seek to maintain this register as it is as an effective register <e> <s> i have sought to suggest that the present register is not effective <e> <s> at least per cent <e> <s> of the present entries are believed to be in error in one way or another <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord would allow me to intervene <e> <s> he referred to i think changes of particulars recorded last year <e> <s> i referred only to the fact that there were entries <e> <s> is the noble lord really suggesting that only of those had changes to report to the registrar <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> i know that my noble friend was expecting that i should respond to this point and as he has specifically mentioned the department in which i serve perhaps i should do so <e> <s> i am informed that the proof-reading of bills is not in fact the responsibility of the department and is not conducted by them <e> <s> indeed they are given no opportunity to do so <e> <s> on the other hand in fairness to the printer who thus comes under my noble friends lash i think that it is correct to say that on this occasion in respect of this particular measure the draft that was presented to him for printing did contain a number of manuscript amendments to the typescript which may have caused him some difficulty <e> <s> i understand also that there is considerable pressure on the government printer at present for one reason or another which has no doubt added to his difficulties <e>

to move amendment no <e> <s> now <e> <s> as for the question of whether or not they are consequential perhaps my noble and learned friend lord mackay can deal with that particular point in a moment as he will wish to address your lordships on this particular motion <e>", "<cs> i understand that it has been agreed through the usual channels that we should now adjourn consideration of this bill in committee proceed with the other business and then continue with this bill again at eight oclock <e> <s> accordingly i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house be now resumed <e>", "<cs> if i may respond to the noble lord lord seebohm without any disrespect to the noble lord lord lloyd if the committee is persuaded by the arguments that i shall seek to deploy i hope that noble lords who have similar if not identical amendments will not seek to move them when we get to them later <e>", "<cs> if i may say what i have to say and then if noble lords who have other amendments on the marshalled list are not satisfied they may deploy their arguments when we come to their amendments <e> <s> may i first congratulate the noble lord lord lloyd on the ingenuity of his attempt to deal with the problem of concert parties <e> <s> sensitive to the concern expressed by the government about the burden which the bill even in its present form will impose

flexibility <e> <s> instead of maintaining dogmatically the hard line that we were not in any circumstances going to proceed with the introduction of the control of these concert parties to which the noble lords amendment refers we considered very carefully all that was said and came to the conclusion in the light of a reassessment of the parliamentary time available that it would after all be possible to deal with this matter <e>", "<cs> that is one view though i must say not one that i share <e> <s> i had indeed hoped that the assurance that i have given which is a very clear one to the effect that we will as soon as maybe table amendments to deal with the problem which noble lords <e>", "<cs> with regard to the first point that the noble lord raised as to whether it would be

be formally added to the bill i am not certain that that is a procedure that has ever occurred in the past <e> <s> however i think it is one that on this occasion at least deserves some attention <e>

amendment moved by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran the noble lords in whose names this amendment stands might have felt able not to move it <e> <s> be that as it may they are quite entitled to do so <e>", "<cs> as was evident from the speech of the noble lord lord wedderburn when moving the new clause the amendment contains so many significant features that it is difficult to know where to begin and i hope the committee will forgive me therefore if i deal with the points he raised at some length <e> <s> our starting point must however be the announcement which i made earlier this afternoon that the government intend to bring forward their own proposals for amendments to the law relating to the disclosure of interests <e> <s> as i have said on an earlier amendment i am not in a position to foreshadow the governments proposals in any detail <e> <s> i would however expect them to cover some but not all of the matters covered by this new clause <e>", "<cs> we accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> i understand that my noble friends amendment has the backing of the law society of scotland which has suggested that the expression undischarged bankrupt in section of the companies act would extend to such a person regardless of whether the bankruptcy procedure was in an english or a scottish court were it not for the terms of subsection of that section <e> <s> since that subsection amends subsection so that the undischarged bankrupt in scotland must seek the leave of the appropriate scottish court and as an english bankrupt cannot obtain such leave it is argued that the effect of section is to enable an english undischarged bankrupt to act as a director of a company despite the law and courts of scotland <e> <s> it may also have the opposite effect geographically speaking that a scottish undischarged bankrupt may be able to act as a director in england <e>", "<cs> i must confess that i do not have in front of me all the details of the case to which my noble friend refers <e> <s> with my noble and learned friend sitting beside me on the bench and either he or his predecessor were apparently concerned in the case to which my noble friend refers it would be right if we considered carefully what my noble friend has said and if necessary returned to this point at a later stage <e> <s> i shall undertake to do that and i hope therefore that my noble friend will not press the amendment now <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend has explained the purpose of this amendment is to remove an inconsistency in the present law relating to the registration of charges <e> <s> by virtue of section k of the act a non-british company which has a place of business in scotland is required to register charges on scottish property <e> <s> i emphasise non-british because the point here is that the requirements do not apply to english companies <e> <s> by virtue of section in contrast a non-english company which has a place of business in scotland is required to register charges on english property <e> <s> i emphasise non-english because as my noble friend has pointed out the requirement accordingly rests on scottish companies <e> <s> hence the certain sense in scotland of being discriminated against which my noble friend has eloquently expressed <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has done the committee a considerable service by drawing this particular point to your lordships attention <e> <s> i readily give the assurance for which the noble lord lord robertson of oakridge asks namely that this matter will be taken carefully into consideration in the drafting of the governments new proposals which i announced earlier this afternoon <e> <s> i hope that with that assurance the noble lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> i am prepared to reply to the noble lords amendment at some length but it may be for the convenience of your lordships at this particular juncture if i do not do that and ask for the noble lords understanding in respect of the future clauses that we have undertaken to bring forward <e> <s> they will be as comprehensive as we can make them in the circumstances <e> <s> some of the points raised by the noble lord in his amendments are very pertinent ones of which we shall certainly wish to take account in the drafting of our amendments <e> <s> really very much the same arguments apply as those which i offered to the noble lord lord robertson of oakridge just now <e> <s> i hope that <e>", "<cs> i undertake to use my best endeavours to that end but we are in the hands of parliamentary draftsmen and others and i cannot give a categorical assurance <e>", "<cs> this amendment has been the subject of correspondence between my department and various people including the noble lords honourable friend the honourable member for dearne valley <e> <s> while believing that the grounds for doubt over the application to share option schemes of the exemption for employee share schemes in section of the act have been exaggerated the government are willing to accept that amendments to remove any doubt should be included in the bill <e> <s> however we do not believe that the amendments proposed by the noble lord would be completely effective for their intended purpose <e> <s> the proposed references to acquisition of shares under an employee share scheme may not include shares allotted in pursuance of a share option scheme if the basic premise of the doubters is accepted <e>", "<cs> i had an awful feeling that the noble lord was not going to move his amendment <e> <s> this may be an appropriate moment to state the governments position in response to the division last thursday on amendment no <e> <s> moved by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> in moving and speaking to that amendment noble lords made it clear that they were concerned not so much with the detail of that amendment as with the issue of principle of the retention of the registry of business names <e> <s> the amendment was of course agreed to and in the light of that decision the government would not think it right or in accordance with our normal conventions to divide the committee again on the same point during this stage of our proceedings <e> <s> accordingly the government will not seek to divide on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i ought to make it clear that while tabling of corrective amendments if i can call them that at report stage is a possibility that we are examining it is not necessarily the one that we shall follow because the bill has yet to go through the other place <e> <s> it may be that we shall prefer to correct the position or seek to correct the position in the other place rather than at the report stage in your lordships house <e> <s> i do not think in this context that we can be subject to the strictures that we have been subjected to in respect of the other matters on which we have tabled amendments <e> <s> the proposals to abolish the rbn were indeed contained in the bill when it was first presented to your lordships <e>", "<cs> i doubt that this is the moment to pursue this interesting dialogue <e> <s> let me simply rest on saying that i do not agree with everything that the noble lord has said <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord may now see fit to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> the governments proposals for the reform of the legislative requirements governing company names whether as an initial registration or a subsequent change which are contained in clauses and of the bill recognise the real difficulties which have been experienced since in seeking to apply on an equitable basis the wide discretionary powers contained in section of the act <e> <s> with over names now on the register to which over are being added each year it would be impossible frankly to ensure for example that there was no possible confusion between names even if more staff could be provided <e> <s> on the other hand it is important to put this issue into perspective <e> <s> as i said the annual rate of registration exceeds as has been the case for some years <e> <s> nevertheless the number of objections received by the registrar in the last year was only just over despite some necessary relaxation in the last months of the criteria within the present wide discretion against which new names are compared with those already registered <e> <s> it is against that background that one should assess the arguments on the one hand that the translation of the present discretion will create a rogues charter and on the <e>", "<cs> my lords while the united states will have an important role to play in this matter in due course that is when they have determined their policy the fact is that the principal organisation involved in reaching a settlement will be the united nations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i cannot comment on the press reports relating to the sources <e>", "<cs> my lords it is right to say that the settlement in rhodesia is a source of hope that a settlement can also be achieved in namibia <e> <s> but i would warn against drawing too close a parallel between the two situations for i doubt very much whether the approach which was successful in the case of the rhodesian situation would be equally fruitful with regard to namibia <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it is true to say that the united states have recognised unita as such <e> <s> there was the repeal of the clark amendment which may it seems pave the way for certain assistance to be granted to unita if the american government so decide but this is a matter for the american government and the american congress <e> <s> we have full diplomatic relations with the angolan government and do not recognise or support any opposition movement in angola <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first point put by the right reverend prelate the question of the way forward in the namibian context it is not for the united kingdom alone to decide whether delay occurs <e>", "<cs> my lords not for the first time the noble lord has over-simplified the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords we condemn all violence from wherever it may come particularly in this context <e> <s> however the south africans are not alone in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords many supplementary questions seek to ascribe to the south africans one motive or another <e> <s> i can only answer for the motives of the british government in this matter <e> <s> our motive is to seek a settlement in this area as soon as may be <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of the ideology of one party or another in namibia will in due course be a matter for the namibian people to decide and that is the purpose of our policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not of course have in front of me the details of the matter to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> all i can do is to make the general point that i have made to your lordships on many occasions we regret any cuts that may be necessary in our aid budget but if we do not make our dispositions in accordance with the resources available then in due course we shall have no resources at all <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness knows and as i have told her and other members of your lordships house on many occasions the main thrust of our policy on this matter is to achieve a rgime of lower air fares available to everybody <e> <s> we have not been without some success although i hasten to add that we have not achieved as much as i would have wished at this stage but in this context i am pleased to be able to report that for example as recently as yesterday the netherlands government have agreed to the new british caledonian mini-prix arrangement for which we have been asking for some time <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords <e> <s> the proposal which is referred to in the noble baronesss question has been put to me <e> <s> but i have explained to those who have been to see me in exactly the same <e>", "<cs> my lords what is sometimes misunderstood in this matter is that the ultimate object which the noble baroness seeks is exactly the same one as i seek <e> <s> the difference between us is the way by which we get there <e>", "<cs> that really is no doubt so my lords <e> <s> but i have no power to direct the airlines in these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords if iata made a recommendation of that nature it would i think be for the civil aviation authority to consider it and i would then endorse their approval or disapproval as the case may be <e>", "<cs> my lords may i start this evening as i started yesterday evening in my answer to the unstarred question of the noble lord lord hatch of lusby with an apology for my voice <e> <s> if i finally fade away my noble friend lord long will stand up and read out whatever happens to be left of my speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not accept the noble lords description of the non-aligned countries as the saviours of this conference <e> <s> it has indeed been a long and difficult one but one of the reasons for that was initial russian reluctance to discuss the implementation of the helsinki final act in the period since the last review conference <e> <s> as for the french proposal it is true that the soviets have accepted at least one part of that proposal indeed only one part of that proposal <e> <s> however the proposal itself consists of at least four elements all of which are necessary to form a credible whole and it remains to be seen whether the soviets will accept the whole of that proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords i most certainly agree that the negotiations to which the noble lord refers and which are being held in geneva and vienna as well as the salt process itself are separate from the helsinki review conference which is now reaching its final stages <e> <s> but i think that the french proposal as a whole is likely to be the most important outcome of this madrid conference <e>", "<cs> my lords that remains to be seen <e> <s> but i have to confess that going on past performance the prospects are not good <e>", "<cs> my lords poland is represented but i do not know the name of its representative <e>", "<cs> my lords the french proposal envisages initially the negotiation of what are called militarily significant verifiable and binding confidence-building measures applying to the whole of europe from the atlantic to the urals <e> <s> it is this last point of the geographical extent of these measures that the soviets appear to have initially accepted but the other three aspects of the proposal are apparently still being considered by them <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no question of adopting any form of european community passport <e> <s> our passports remain british <e> <s> we do however intend to adopt the european community common format for united kingdom passports at the same time as we adopt the international civil aviation organisations recommendations for a passport in a simplified standardised format with machine-readable capability <e> <s> a considerable amount of work is needed to assess the costs and the technical problems involved and until this has been done it is not possible for the government to set a date for the change in the format of united kingdom passports <e> <s> until that change takes place we will continue to issue united kingdom passports for the same periods as at present <e> <s> there will be opportunities for the new format of united kingdom passports to be debated before any change is made <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend that the governments position on this matter has been that no important change like this should take place unless there is some real and identifiable benefit to be derived from it <e> <s> the principal benefit to which i referred in my main answer will be the machine-readable capability which will greatly enhance the processing of passengers moving through our ports and airports <e> <s> also a united kingdom passport in the common format as we foresee it will retain the main characteristics of our present passport such as the royal coat of arms on the front and the rubric about her britannic majestys principal secretary of state inside the front cover <e> <s> it is likely to be burgundy coloured instead of blue and the front cover will bear the additional words european community <e>", "<cs> not yet my lords <e> <s> i think the details are coming before the council of ministers at their next meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a slightly different question <e> <s> speaking from memory i think there are more than two channels for the various passport holders going through heathrow <e> <s> there are eec passport holders united kingdom passport holders and i think there is at least one other channel and all of course are treated equally when they get to the desk <e>", "<cs> my lords the time taken to process persons going through the immigration controls depends among other things on the purpose for which they are coming here <e>", "<cs> i should not be surprised my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords on the question of parliamentary approval the position as i understand it is this that formal parliamentary approval for the format of the passport that we issue is not required but of course the government would wish to take very carefully into consideration the views which parliament has already expressed and will express in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords a committee of your lordships house considered this matter a year or so ago <e> <s> we had a debate in your lordships house on the report at about that time and i had with me then and showed to a number of noble lords a specimen of how we then thought the passport might look <e> <s> there has been no substantial change in our thoughts since then <e> <s> on the other hand this matter has still to be finally decided so i should be reluctant to put a specimen in the library at this stage when our thoughts are still rather fluid <e> <s> however we have made no secret of the way our thoughts are going which includes the explanation that i gave earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not i am afraid in a position to give that assurance <e> <s> after all this matter is at this stage at least a european matter <e> <s> however we shall certainly want to take the views of parliament very carefully into account <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords but i must emphasise that it is not proposed to issue a european community passport <e> <s> it is proposed that the passport will remain a national document issued by national <e>", "<cs> my lords what i had in mind was of course processing a persons application to enter the united kingdom <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes me to use all those words on every occasion i may unduly detain your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of the fees payable by students coming from europe is of course related to our membership of the european community but as to the question of students fees payable by nigerian students of course we appreciate the nigerian governments very real concern over this matter <e> <s> the issue was indeed fully discussed with president shagari during his recent visit <e> <s> on several occasions and again during this recent visit we have expressed our deep regret at the necessity to charge the full fees <e> <s> we greatly value the contribution of nigerian students to the british educational system <e> <s> we have explained that the effects of the increase are being closely monitored and i should perhaps point out that some postgraduate grants for exceptional students are of course available from the department of education and the committee of vice-chancellors <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so that is slightly wide of the question on the order paper but in the general way our policy in connection with student fees as with the rest of our economic policies has to be related to our economic resources <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we welcome the fact that over many years students from nigeria including a number of very distinguished ones have attended our schools and universities which no doubt is one of the reasons why our present relationship with them is so strong <e> <s> we hope and believe that that relationship will continue but it is not likely to continue very effectively if our own economy in britain remains in disarray <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that that is a significant problem <e> <s> a good many of our exports to nigeria as elsewhere are of course covered by the ecgd arrangement <e>", "<cs> my lords our opposition to apartheid is of course well-known <e> <s> we do not always agree with some of our african friends on precisely the best way to counter it but the noble lord may be sure that the nigerians are well aware of our views as we are of theirs <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i would readily undertake to look at any case my noble friend draws to my attention <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that goes rather wide of the question on the order paper but i think the noble lord is aware of this governments view on apartheid as indeed are the nigerian government <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the question of namibia is slightly different from the question of south africa although they are often discussed in the same context <e> <s> in fact our views <e>", "<cs> my lords as i indicated in the first answer the visit was a great success <e> <s> on the question of sanctions against south africa which is i imagine what is at the back of the noble lords mind in pressing his supplementary it is of course the fact that we have not taken up a position on sanctions against south africa at this moment but we have consistently made it clear that we believe that sanctions would cause grave damage to the prospects of a resumption of negotiation on namibia for example and indeed to the process of peaceful change in southern africa <e> <s> furthermore it would create considerable economic problems for other african countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not want to compare the future prospects of nigeria with south <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure of the relevance of that question <e> <s> the noble lord may be assisted if i say that there are about nigerian students in this country at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords it is indeed the case that namibia was discussed with the president during his recent visit <e> <s> as is well known both our governments are very disappointed at the breakdown of the geneva talks <e> <s> my right honourable friend the prime minister expressed our determination to continue to work with our partners of the five and with our friends in africa for a peaceful and negotiated settlement <e> <s> we hope that all concerned will look for a positive way forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder who my noble friend is accusing of malpractice <e> <s> can my noble friend be specific on that <e>", "<cs> my lords this i think will be a matter for the british airports authority not for me <e> <s> but i cannot think that they would want to retain the land if the planning procedures had turned down their application <e> <s> what earthly good use would they have for a number of farms which they are currently <e>", "<cs> my lords i absolutely agree with the noble lord that as i said the conference was indeed a great success <e> <s> with regard to the additional million which my noble friend lord soames was able to announce at the conference as coming from the british government million of that will be used for land settlement in zimbabwe million will be used for zimbabwean trainees both in the united kingdom and in zimbabwe and the remaining million will be used for regional projects particularly those discussed at the sadcc conference which was held at maputo recently <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has indeed lighted upon a very important matter which was certainly raised at the aid donors conference <e> <s> however the financing of purchases of that maize for other countries would of course relate to the aid allocations to those other countries <e> <s> as for the transportation arrangements to which my noble friend referred it is certainly true that the transport infrastructure in that part of the world does need some development and that indeed is likely to be the purpose for which the final million of our new million to which i referred will be used <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly convey those sentiments to my noble friend and i shall also consider what can be done to give the house additional details of the various pledges that were made at the salisbury conference <e> <s> the noble lord referred to the various other countries that were there in particular the eastern bloc countries <e> <s> i have to tell the noble lord that the eastern bloc was conspicuous by its absence from this conference <e> <s> so far as i know not a single penny was pledged by the eastern bloc countries during the course of the conference although one eastern nation was i think present <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i ought to rise to that bait <e> <s> if the noble lord is referring to the bingham report for example which referred <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is right when he says that of course regional projects are important if not essential for that part of the world <e> <s> indeed that was the reason why million of the million which my noble friend announced at the recent conference will be devoted to those purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not the slightest idea why the soviet union was not represented at the conference <e> <s> i understand that only one eastern bloc country was represented namely bulgaria <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mishcon during the course of his remarks indicated that he would want to move this amendment separately and then one way or another move or at least speak to subsequent amendments which suggest a rather different approach to this problem <e> <s> my response will i hope subsume both this amendment and subsequent amendments <e> <s> certainly my answer to this amendment will i hope be helpful to some extent to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will not mind my intervening <e> <s> the noble lord complained bitterly that the registrar was not doing his duty <e> <s> he drew your lordships attention to a case which i think he regarded as regrettable <e>", "<cs> my lords i had rather thought that the reply which i offered to the last amendment would have covered this one as well <e> <s> i accept that the proposal put forward by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran is not the same as the proposal put forward by the noble lord lord mishcon in his amendment which your lordships have just considered <e> <s> all the same i hope that the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran will agree that the concession which i indicated that i was prepared to consider in respect of an amendment which we shall reach very shortly will indeed cover the matter that is worrying him and that therefore he will not see fit to press his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i need to amplify the assurance i gave when speaking to the earlier amendment on this subject <e> <s> i have undertaken that the government will bring forward amendments embodying the spirit if that is the right word of what the noble lord has proposed <e> <s> there are certain additional features which we shall need to include and which do not appear in the amendment tabled by the noble lord but i hope that with that assurance he will feel able to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give an undertaking that amendments will he tabled by third reading <e> <s> we shall do our best but the pressures on the draftsmen being what they are i fear that it may not be possible <e> <s> but of course if the amendments are then included by the other place in this bill your lordships will have a chance to consider them when the bill comes back to us as doubtless it will in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the usual channels have agreed that we should go no further tonight <e> <s> accordingly i move that further consideration of this bill on report be adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot of course answer for the aid policies of the previous administration which i fancy could not have been sustained in the light of current economic circumstances <e> <s> as for the charge that our aid cuts have fallen unfairly on the aid budget as compared with other expenditure programmes i should perhaps point out that trade agriculture employment energy industry and housing will all fare worse so that that is not a charge which can be sustained <e> <s> as for gross aid in that year will be million the first time in fact that british aid has exceeded billion and an increase of about per cent <e> <s> in cash terms on the money available last year <e>", "<cs> my lords i gave the cash figures for which are in fact as i described <e> <s> i think that the noble lord may be referring to the figures adjusted for inflation which are of course a different matter <e> <s> we have made no secret of the fact that our aid budget must be trimmed to coincide with our resources and that i should have thought was a prudent policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that our aid performance compares at all badly with that of a great many of our european colleagues <e> <s> indeed compared with some eastern european countries and soviet countries our aid is many times the modest expenditure which they feel able to support <e> <s> as for the question by the noble lord about the percentage of gnp which we achieve in this matter we of course accept in principle the per cent <e> <s> of gnp aid target but like our predecessors including the noble lord himself we are not committed to a timetable for achieving it <e> <s> progress must of course depend upon our financial and economic circumstances and indeed the other calls on our resources <e>", "<cs> my lords i should want to refute the charge that this government have been responsible for irresponsible allocation of aid monies <e> <s> indeed i think i should be prepared to defend the previous administration against that charge as well because all governments of every complexion have to a greater or lesser extent been determined to ensure that aid monies are properly disbursed and indeed almost all capital aid that we disburse these days not only under <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is certainly right my lords in that the percentage of gnp which is used by some as a measure of aid performance is at best an imperfect measure and sometimes other figures are more helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have in front of me the figures of the aid performance of our other immediate european neighbours <e> <s> i recall discussing this with the noble lord across the floor of the house and i seem to remember telling him from the brief i then had in front of me that our performance compared very favourably even with our western european partners <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords opposite are comparing what is now a realistic aid programme with the moonshine if i may call it that they thought they were going to achieve when they were still in office <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend not for the first time has put his finger on a crucial aspect of our present aid policy which is to get the maximum value for money <e> <s> i believe that the training we can offer to overseas students in various ways is one of the very best uses for our aid monies <e>", "<cs> that is another view my lords but i find it difficult to relate it to the view advanced by so many of the noble lords noble friends <e>", "<cs> my lords i am of course in the hands of the house on this matter but i had expected that this amendment would be the one upon which the noble lord deployed his arguments and i deployed mine on the general question of the register of business names but i am <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy that that should be so if that is the wish of the noble lord <e> <s> but on the question of amendment no <e> <s> to which we shall come in a moment the principle that we propose in that amendment which is clear from the marshalled list is one with which i think the noble lord knows we have some sympathy <e> <s> therefore in respect of this amendment i should like to deploy my arguments on that narrow point and we can consider the wider point of the register of business names in a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i appreciate that the noble lord and i believe noble lords on the liberal benches do not agree with the proposal that was originally contained in the bill and no doubt regret that the government are now seeking to persuade your lordships to reconsider the matter <e> <s> however we shall all have to take our chances in the division lobby in due course if that be necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord and the house will allow me to intervene <e> <s> i did not say years <e> <s> i said man-years <e> <s> the noble lord really must not distort what i said <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships may think the time is now approaching when we ought to make up our minds on this matter <e> <s> i want for a few moments <e>", "<cs> well my lords i am aware of that but that simply adds to the burden the registration fee is adding to the burden of the small unincorporated businesses which i am seeking to protect in this way <e> <s> the new enhanced proposals which are contained in the amendments in my name which follow i believe provide a precise and accurate means of conveying to consumers to suppliers and to those who have a legitimate business with the enterprise concerned precisely the information they require precisely at the place they require it and precisely at the time they require it <e> <s> that i believe is a very substantial improvement on the existing out-of-date and inadequate arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it was in reply to the same amendment moved at the committee stage that i announced that the government now intend to bring forward their own proposals to amend the law relating to the disclosure of interests in shares and that these proposals would cover concert parties <e> <s> had we been ready to do so we would of course have tabled our clauses for this debate and i am sorry that we have not yet been able to do that <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord and the house will be patient <e> <s> we are working intensively on this matter and we shall bring forward our proposals just as soon as possible but f fear that it may not be possible to do so before the bill leaves your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords the proposal which was considered was of course a proposal for a study <e> <s> it was not a proposal which of itself would necessarily have led to further effective steps of multilateral disarmament <e> <s> however i can say that the secretary-generals advisory board on disarmament studies from where the proposal came was not indeed unanimous upon the value of it although of course there is much public interest in disarmament and informed discussion is promoted by both governments and non-governmental organisations not least in the united kingdom <e> <s> we concluded eventually that an abstention was justified <e>", "<cs> my lords we concluded that the limited resources available to the united nations in terms not only of money but of the facilities of the secretariat and other things were not best deployed in the moving forward of the study <e> <s> however as i said in my earlier reply despite our abstention the study will in fact go forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i am highly suspicious of government organisations designed principally to disseminate information <e> <s> i prefer the free press that we have which can disseminate whatever information appears to it to be the most relevant <e> <s> however in that context i can tell the noble lord lord brockway as i think he knows that the government distribute a document called the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the distribution of united nations documents is not within my gift but i certainly agree that a freer dissemination of information in some of the countries to which my noble friend has referred would be most advantageous <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not opposed in principle to the united nations studying these matters <e> <s> what we think is important though is that the united nations should establish an order of priorities in these matters having regard to the fact that their resources and facilities are limited <e> <s> we thought that on this occasion there were matters of greater importance to which it was more immediately necessary for the united nations to turn its attention <e>", "<cs> my lords the united nations is of course well involved in the question of multilateral disarmament negotiations <e> <s> there already are a number of fora in which such negotiations take place <e> <s> as i have said on many previous occasions from this box it is sometimes disappointing that more progress has not been made <e> <s> there is the conference at geneva there are the multilateral balanced force reduction negotiations as they are called which go on in vienna and there are various other meetings which take place from time to time in new york <e> <s> we are not without fora what we are so far without are concrete results <e>", "<cs> my lords if that were to be achieved i would be very much in favour of it but i suspect that the best way to smoke out those who make lavish proposals which have no conviction behind them is by bringing them to the conference table in genuine negotiation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure which proposal the noble lord is referring to but if he is referring to the proposal which is contained in his question then as i said earlier the motion to carry that study forward was carried and therefore presumably the study will in fact go forward <e> <s> but on the noble lords earlier assertion that continued maintenance of military vigilance is not consistent with talks on multilateral disarmament i must simply say that i disagree with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord began his observations by saying that what he had heard today was the worst statement he had ever heard from the government dispatch box in years <e> <s> i have been at this dispatch box for a much less period of time than that and i have heard a lot worse too <e>", "<cs> my lords i have heard it said that the reports of your lordships european communities select committee are read with the closest attention particularly in the commission itself <e> <s> i hope and believe that that will be so in the case of the report that we are considering tonight because it is of the same high standard that we have come to expect from our european communitys scrutiny committee and its sub-committees <e> <s> indeed following the timely motion of the noble lord lord plowden this evening the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that my noble friend feels like that <e> <s> i shall certainly convey my noble friends views to my other noble friends and right honourable friends who are responsible for reaching these decisions and i am sure that his anxiety will spur them on to even greater efforts <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not certain that i follow the gist of my noble friends supplementary question <e> <s> i answered a question about industrial workshops and not about the employment of anyone <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will not be surprised to know that i do not have that figure in front of me but the number now being built as i said in my original answer is greater than for many years <e>", "<cs> indeed yes my lords a number of them are being built for that purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an interesting question but it goes rather wide of what is on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords if that was the gist of the supplementary question put by my friend lady vickers then i apologise to her for not understanding the point she put to me <e> <s> i cannot off-the-cuff i am afraid give the answer as to how many people are employed in these new workshops not all of them are yet occupied but i will see whether i can find a figure and provide it to both my noble friends <e>", "<cs> my lords a number of these new small workshops and factory premises are indeed being built in development areas particularly those which are being financed by the english industrial estates corporation whose activities are generally confined to those areas <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords i shall be very pleased to do that if i can find the information as i am sure i can <e> <s> if my noble friend would like to table a question for written answer for example i would be happy to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend stressed to the japanese government our serious concern about the growing imbalance of trade between the united kingdom and japan and between the european community and japan <e> <s> he made it clear that the government fully support the course of action recently agreed by the foreign affairs council <e> <s> he emphasised that the united kingdom in common with the other member states is looking to japan to exercise greater restraint in exporting and to open up its domestic market to imports <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend that the government fully share his aspirations about the future progress of trade between the united kingdom and japan <e> <s> as for his kind words about my noble friend i will see that they are conveyed to the foreign secretary although the reason why i am answering this question today is because this is a matter for the department of trade <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly we do everything we can to encourage japanese investment and other appropriate foreign investment in the united kingdom <e> <s> the noble lord will be aware of the plans recently announced for the nissan company to do just that <e>", "<cs> my lords that is another matter but it has a grain of truth in it <e> <s> all the same in this connection i think it is encumbent on japanese exporters to exercise appropriate marketing policies <e>", "<cs> my lords my departments official trade statistics show that united kingdom imports from guinea were million and exports were million <e> <s> imports thus showed an increase of million over and exports an increase of million over though i understand that both the import and export figures may have been distorted in by items in transit <e> <s> in any event the increase in our trade is significant which is a welcome achievement by british firms <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said the increased figures which i reported for may have been considerably distorted by items in transit to which i referred <e> <s> too much importance should therefore not be attached to them <e> <s> as to ecgd cover i am afraid that that would depend upon a satisfactory resolution of the difficulties over the rescheduled debt agreement with which i think the noble lord is familiar <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot tell the noble lord what is the level of trade between guinea and <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first echo the sentiments of every noble lord who has spoken this evening in recording my appreciation of the opportunity that the noble lord lord chitnis has given us to discuss this important matter again this evening <e> <s> i say again because of course i have answered <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> it is money which is being channelled to the international red cross and to at least one other aid agency <e> <s> the cash which has gone to the icrc is european units of account and tonnes of cereals and tonnes of milk powder have been sent <e> <s> the catholic relief services have received tonnes of cereals tonnes of milk powder and tonnes of butter oil <e>", "<cs> her majestys governments share of that aid is substantial <e> <s> aid has also been given through the united nations high commission for refugees to which of course the united kingdom contributes <e> <s> we naturally believe that a political solution to the conflict in el salvador is greatly to be preferred to the continuation of the present fighting <e> <s> we would of course support any realistic proposals to bring this about <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord will not be disappointed <e> <s> my lords the noble lord referred to texas and what he saw as an unsatisfactory situation in a particular city there <e> <s> i understand that the state of texas has now regulated local monopolies such as the one to which the noble lord referred they are supervised by state regulatory bodies <e> <s> the government have no proposals for a similar system here which will not i think be necessary <e> <s> i referred earlier to canada to which the noble lord also referred <e>", "<cs> i do not think that is the case at all my lords <e> <s> there was a clear abuse of the legal position in texas which the local authorities there saw fit quite rightly to correct and naturally abuses of the position need to be corrected all the time in every rgime that exists <e>", "<cs> my lords i suggest that my noble friend should go to see the chief whip <e> <s> the principle of the split was raised by a number of noble lords <e> <s> the idea of this split did not originally start in the mind of my right honourable friend the secretary of state who came in for such criticism at the hand of the noble lord lord glenamara <e> <s> the separation of the post office has been under consideration for many years <e> <s> the carter committee which was set up at the end of by the previous administration recommended firmly in favour of separating posts from telecoms all those years ago <e> <s> no decision was made by the last government and soon after we came into office we decided to end the uncertainty <e> <s> extensive consultations with the chairman of the post office the post office users national council and other interested parties including the trade unions showed <e>", "<cs> my lords we have to consider each and every case on its merits <e> <s> as the noble lord knows under the existing legislation there are procedures for these mergers to be allowed to proceed where the secretary of state decides in a particular case that it is appropriate for this to happen <e> <s> that is what happened in the cases to which the noble lord has referred <e> <s> as i have said this is a matter which we wish to keep under review and we are doing so <e> <s> i would not wish to prejudge the outcome of the consideration that is being given to that particular matter <e>", "<cs> my lords over the last two years the british overseas trade board which is under the chairmanship of my noble friend lord limerick has been running a campaign on the importance of non-price factors to export performance <e> <s> conferences have been held in london glasgow newcastle cardiff bradford manchester and coventry drawing on the experience of representatives of successful exporters in these localities who attribute their success to paying great attention to these non-price factors <e> <s> your lordships may wish to know that these conferences were chaired either by my noble friend lord limerick or more importantly by his royal highness the duke of kent and that they have been well attended <e>", "<cs> among other things yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that it is certainly a factor in achieving the orders in the first place <e>", "<cs> my lords the select committees observations and recommendations which cover many aspects of concorde are being studied in detail and in accordance with the normal practice the governments final and considered reply will be delivered to parliament as soon as possible <e> <s> however i cannot at present anticipate when this will be or the form or content of the governments response <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall of course have to take very careful account of the report of the select committee <e> <s> my noble friend refers to the first place for britain in civil aviation matters <e> <s> while that is most certainly the case with regard to the technical achievements of concorde it is unhappily not the case with regard to the profitability of british airways <e>", "<cs> my lords i am ashamed to have to say that i am not able to give my noble friend an answer to either of those questions but i will certainly find out what the position is in both cases and write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords there are many considerations which will have to be taken into account in this matter <e> <s> the financial implications are only one aspect <e> <s> we shall certainly want to take all those considerations into account in reaching any new decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be possible in theory for the british government to reach a decision unilaterally on this matter but i must emphasise that we would much prefer to reach any new decision in conjuntion with our french partners and i have no doubt that we should <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of any lack of enthusiasm in british airways at the present time for the operation of concorde <e> <s> the principal inhibition against extending the route network over which concorde could operate is securing overflight rights from the governments concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is indeed quite right such a decision if we ever came to take it would be a very serious one indeed and would therefore receive the necessary prior consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords a good deal was said at the committee and report stages on this question of similarity between company names <e> <s> i gave certain undertakings on behalf of the government then and i should like to repeat them now <e> <s> the government are persuaded that there is a genuine problem here and we accept that something has to be done <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon tabled his amendment at the report stage <e> <s> i said that the government accepted the principle and i undertook <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments i am referring of course to this one and the following one give rise to issues both of substance and of administrative detail <e> <s> first we on this bench consider that the proposed requirement for registration of information about business names with local authorities is unnecessary as our own proposals for disclosure by the traders concerned will provide all the information which the public and the trading community need <e> <s> as a result what is proposed involves an unnecessary and undesirable extension of local bureaucracy imposing still further costs by the public sector on private industry and commerce <e> <s> it would also of course increase local authority manpower and costs for work which bears little relationship to the general duties of the local authority <e> <s> i note that it is proposed that fees should be charged to cover these costs but if the proposed fees turned out to be inadequate the deficit would have to be borne by the ratepayers <e> <s> it would have been of interest to know whether the noble lord had any communication with local authorities and their representative organisations before proposing to impose this additional statutory duty upon them <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the noble lord was trying to persuade us to accept the principle but the fact is that he tabled specific amendments to this bill and it is those that we have to consider not the principles which are in the back of the noble lords mind and which he hopes will cover the deficiencies of his amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i now rise to move that this bill do now pass <e> <s> in commending this bill to your lordships on the occasion of its second reading i referred to the significant contributions which it makes within the field of company law to a number of broad policy objectives helping small firms reducing unnecessary burdens on companies streamlining government administration countering crime and misconduct <e> <s> i venture to suggest that tested against these objectives the bill to which your lordships have just given a third reading is an even better bill than the bill which we first debated some two months ago <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may take the first point made by the noble lord certainly the talks to which he referred have not proceeded as effectively as we would have hoped <e> <s> however they are still talking the atmosphere remains good and after what i fear will be a further pause pending the forthcoming elections in cyprus we hope that further progress will be made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> our policy for the moment anyway is one of proper and genuine support for the efforts of the united nations in cyprus and we think that is the way forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that we shall have regard to the interests of all those concerned in the discussions to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> the noble lord will in addition be aware of our position on the question of payments for the bases that is to say that none is due <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with my noble friend that the way forward in this matter is one which has to be taken very carefully and that is indeed what is happening under the auspices of the united nations <e>", "<cs> my lords i absolutely agree that the agreement to which the noble lord referred and to which indeed the noble lord lord brockway referred is a gleam of hope <e> <s> we would wish to congratulate the united nations and indeed the parties on their recently announced agreement in that regard and we certainly hope that the practical work will start without delay <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can best take those three points together they are a suggestion that there ought to be initiatives from various directions to solve this matter <e> <s> i would reiterate what i said earlier that talks under united nations auspices remain the only practical way forward as indeed the two principal parties agree <e>", "<cs> we remain ready to consider supplementing resolution if that would be helpful to peace and if such a move would be generally welcomed <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly as far as resolution is concerned there would be advantage i think in spelling out in a security council resolution incorporating unchanged the other principles of resolution the political rights of the palestinians including the right to self-determination <e> <s> as to the position in lebanon i certainly agree with my noble friend that the position there gives rise to a very considerable concern <e> <s> indeed i think i shall be answering a question about that tomorrow <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the text of resolution in front of me but i know the noble lords expertise in these matters and i have no doubt that what he says is correct <e> <s> i shall ascertain the position and write to the noble lord if i am wrong <e> <s> but i think that the question that i referred to in my earlier answer about the political rights of the palestinians does need to be seen to <e> <s> but certainly also the plo needs to change its position substantially in this context <e>", "<cs> my lords the european initiative as the noble lord refers to it is of course barely a year old and much progress has to be made in that direction <e> <s> as noble lords will know it is of course the case that the united kingdom takes over the presidency of the council of ministers in a month or two and we shall wish to take up and pursue the work that has been done by our dutch colleagues in the interim <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend that we have no need to lecture our american colleagues as i think my noble friends question implied <e> <s> however my noble friend put his finger on an important point which lies at the heart of our policy towards the plo that it is very important that they should have more than one source of advice to which to turn <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that the interests of israel are paramount in this matter and that israel is certainly entitled to proper assurances with regard to its own security <e> <s> i go on to say that the position of the plo in this matter is therefore quite unacceptable to us and certainly there is no possibility of a settlement with the plo maintaining its present position <e> <s> on the other hand noble lords must remember that the plo represents a very substantial body of palestinian opinion and i do not believe that a settlement will be possible without taking those views into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the high-powered philosophy behind the noble lords supplementary question sometimes passes over my head <e>", "<cs> my lords it is of course the case that the situation in the lebanon has been discussed in the security council on a number of occasions <e> <s> i am not sure that any useful purpose would be served at this moment by repeating some of the declarations that have been made in that forum <e> <s> having said that i cannot hide from your lordships the concern with which we view the present situation in that country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am advised that the united nations could only act in the situation in the lebanon if the government of that country so wished <e> <s> certainly we stand ready to assist in any way we can in the united nations or elsewhere but we believe that the need at the present time is for action by quiet diplomacy behind the scenes <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that there is a considerable amount of diplomacy going on behind the scenes at the present time in connection with the situation in lebanon we have indeed remained in touch with the government of lebanon as well as the others concerned including syria and israel <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two points that i should like to make to the noble lord because there are two aspects to this matter <e> <s> the first is that as a percentage of our total aid programme the funds available are of course under considerable pressure as the noble lord will be aware <e> <s> however as regards the relative importance of these matters within our total aid budget that is very much a matter for the recipient countries themselves because we would not wish to dictate to them how they spend the money that we are able to provide <e>", "<cs> my lords we would certainly seek to provide our aid funds to those countries who are the poorest and who can make the best use of them <e> <s> but i say again that the way in which they spend the funds that we are able to provide are in the first instance anyway a matter for them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always glad to take the good words of the noble baroness but of course the noble lord lord vernon does put his finger on a very important point in this matter which is that some of the least developed countries of the world are increasing their populations at the greatest rates <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord gowrie wonders if there is another split in the party opposite i rather doubt it <e> <s> i am of course well aware of the views of the party opposite with regard to our total aid budget <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> to the multilateral bodies that is to say to those bodies who are concerned with this matter other than within the framework of our bilateral aid programme we expect to contribute million for the year <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord not for the first time makes a very profound point but not one perhaps that i would feel able to develop at this moment <e>", "<cs> my lords while it is true that our contribution to the multilateral agencies in this connection did decrease by million over the two-year period to which the noble lord referred our contribution to bilateral programmes for population matters increased by million <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the construction industry was not one of those that was in fact discussed at the time of the recent visit <e> <s> i do not have information upon whether or not the chemical industry was raised but i feel certain that there must be some prospects there none the less <e>", "<cs> certainly my lords the noble and learned lord is of course quite right <e>", "<cs> my lords must say that that question occured to me when i was preparing myself to answer this question this afternoon <e> <s> i am afraid that i do not as yet have an answer <e>", "<cs> my lords as i think the noble lord knows the precise level of cover available in any specific market is not normally published but i can assure the noble lord that ecgd cover is fully available for the romanian market and indeed is fully adequate for the needs <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend will allow me to utter more than one sentence i shall come in mere detail to the remarks that my noble friend offered in moving his amendment <e> <s> the two businesses have provided certain services for each other for many years in particular in the areas of vehicle maintenance procurement and research and development <e> <s> this provision in clause <e>", "<cs> the legal advice from the draftsman is that the retention of these paragraphs is necessary in order in particular to enable british telecom to perform the functions to which i referred in my earlier remarks <e> <s> this is a rather detailed legal argument and i must tell my noble friend that i prefer the advice of my officials on the matter <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if i misunderstood what both my noble friends put to me but i remain convinced that the retention of these paragraphs and in particular the powers that they clarify in the hands of british telecom remain appropriate <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will see the merit of this argument and not press his amendments <e>", "<cs> my noble friend accused me of not listening to what he said <e> <s> i do not think that he listened to what i said <e> <s> i very clearly covered that point <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend has pointed out his amendment would restrict the scope of activities that british telecom could carry on to a narrower range than that now available to the post office <e> <s> this is not the governments intention and i believe that the present restriction on the scope of british telecoms subsidiary powers merely that they should he exercised only for the purpose of exercising its main powers under clauses and is sufficient <e> <s> this already prevents british telecom from diversifying outside those activities proper to it <e> <s> in any case it would not always be easy to prove that a particular activity was expedient and this could give rise to uncertainty as to the practical extent of british telecoms powers <e> <s> i think that my noble friend recognised that point in his opening remarks <e> <s> this would surely be undesirable and in the light of that short explanation i hope that my noble friend will be satisfied with what i have said <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but i am not a walking compendium as i should be on all the post office <e>", "<cs> again i would not want to give a precise legal definition of the two words except to say that the word convenient is there as we would wish to take the wider meaning and to maintain these powers as we desire them to be <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly write to my noble friend with whatever additional information i can find on this point <e> <s> of course in the last resort the definition of words in a bill which becomes an act must be for the courts <e>", "<cs> i think my noble friend will have gathered from my reaction to his earlier amendments that the government do not wish to restrict british telecoms powers in the way that he has proposed <e> <s> that remains so in relation to these amendments although i am advised that they would not have that effect in practice because of british telecoms power to do anything requisite advantageous or convenient to which we were referring just now for the exercise of its main powers under clause <e>", "<cs> i think the word others goes wider than the term outside persons and that was deliberate <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has drawn attention to the fact that the words or promote the activities of do not occur in the corresponding power in the post office act <e> <s> they have been added deliberately to clarify bts power to promote the exports of united kingdom goods <e> <s> i am sure your lordships will agree that it is desirable that bt should be active in this regard and indeed the post office has taken a large part in promoting the export of system x which the committee will know is a modern exchange system <e> <s> the words in question have been added to put beyond question that bt can undertake activities which further the interests of outside bodies but which may not consist of assistance given to them <e> <s> an example would be exhibiting in support of united kingdom manufacturers <e> <s> i hope that gives my noble friend the explanation he has sought <e>", "<cs> the power to promote and oppose measures in the northern ireland assembly which this amendment would remove is a common provision in nationalised industry statutes it appears for instance in the aircraft and shipbuilding industries act and there are good reasons for sticking with precedent in this case <e>", "<cs> first may i say to the noble lord lord young of dartington how much we appreciate his appreciation if that is the right way to put it of the recent announcement by my honourable friend about the european convention in relation to the use of computer-stored personal information <e>", "<cs> i think that the spirit of these amendments which the noble lord has reiterated and with which i have already expressed some sympathy is as far as i can really go at this stage <e> <s> as for the enforcement point which the noble lord lord young has put to me this is a rather esoteric point and while i would wish to stand by the present wording of the clause i will certainly look into the point raised by the noble lord to see whether i can elucidate further to him in private <e>", "<cs> i have endeavoured to make clear the legal position in this matter which i agree is somewhat diverse <e> <s> however i think what my noble friend is asking for is really something of a consolidation measure and as my noble friend and the committee will be aware that is of course something to which i could not commit myself at present <e>", "<cs> i am aware of course that in the light of recent events which have been referred to there is particular current concern about this matter but i am persuaded that the present legal position is adequate <e> <s> my noble friend referred to the stealing of electricity which would be an offence under the theft act <e> <s> i am speaking purely from my own personal knowledge in this matter which may be at fault but my recollection is that there have been a number of successful prosecutions based upon that offence and it may indeed be the principal course which the authorities would wish to take if an appropriate case came before them <e>", "<cs> i have endeavoured to explain at some length the whole panoply of legal apparatus which exists and which i must confess seems to me to <e>", "<cs> that is a rather different point and certainly i would be happy to consider that if my noble friend wishes to raise it when we get to that point in the bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful again to my noble friend for the explanation he has given of this amendment <e> <s> it is common practice in nationalised industry legislation for a public corporations general duty not to be enforceable at law <e> <s> the provisions in clause and are essentially a general statement of british telecoms role and are not drafted in a way that would facilitate a court deciding how they might apply in a specific case <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend that clause in no way detracts from british telecoms obligations imposed under other parts of the bill and certainly does nothing to remove any legal liability they may have under the general law or clauses and <e> <s> in the light of this explanation i hope my noble friend will not wish to proceed further <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has made clear his view that partly owned subsidiaries of british telecom should be subject to the same statutory controls as wholly owned subsidiaries <e> <s> i should like to explain why this is not appropriate and it may be helpful if i deal as my noble friend did with all his amendments on this point <e> <s> i agree with him that the list of amendments which he read out is indeed the appropriate list in this context <e> <s> there is of course no question that wholly owned subsidiaries of british telecom should not be treated in the same way as british telecom itself a wholly owned subsidiary is clearly a creature of its parent and should be treated accordingly <e> <s> but the position is different with partly owned subsidiaries where there are other shareholders to be considered <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to have to say that owing to some difficulty in the staff work i am not so fully briefed to deal with this matter as i ought to be <e> <s> i apologise to my noble friend for that but i will do my best <e> <s> i think that my noble friend may now realise that the explanation which i gave on his previous amendment stemmed from the definition of a wholly owned subsidiary of another body corporate in section of the companies act <e> <s> i am not entirely certain that that is the correct riposte to my noble friends amendment <e> <s> it might be better if i undertook to look at what my noble friend has said and reply to him between now and the next stage <e> <s> if we are not able to reach agreement by that means then my noble friend had better raise it again at the next stage <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord morris in moving the amendment covered a number of aspects of the treaty of rome and raised a number of legal points <e> <s> i hope my noble friend and the committee will forgive me if i do not now offer a considered response to the difficult legal matters he raised <e> <s> i am none the less grateful to him for drawing the committees attention to the importance of legislating in accordance with the united kingdoms obligations under the treaty of rome <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to sound unsympathetic to the very detailed points which my noble friend raised <e> <s> i should much prefer an opportunity to study in detail what my noble friend lord morris said in his opening remarks when he referred to a number of provisions of the treaty of rome and perhaps give him a private response at a later date if there is anything that i can add to what i have said this evening <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to interrupt my noble friend but the fact is that there is good legal basis for saying what i said that where in a situation such as this one identifies a particular international agreement for example the treaty of rome to which my noble friend and i have referred then in certain circumstances one tends to imply that other international agreements are not therefore necessarily covered <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord glenamara has repeated as he was entitled to do some of the arguments that had been put in another place on this very matter <e> <s> during the committee stage there my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary agreed to consider the matter further with the chairman of british telecommunications <e> <s> as he made clear that we have done but the government remain convinced of the need for this provision which although new in relation to the post office has precedents in legislation introduced by governments from both sides of the house <e>", "<cs> i am not saying that <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness knows this is a complex and indeed a very important matter and i am afraid that it has proved even more complex than we at first imagined <e> <s> but as i have said we are doing our best to produce the statement as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords while i cannot give a categoric assurance that we shall be able to do that would say that i very much hope so <e>", "<cs> my lords i want first to say how grateful i am to my noble friend lord campbell of croy for raising this matter since of course the loss of the derbyshire was indeed a serious and tragic marine casualty <e> <s> it was without doubt one of the most serious losses sustained by the united kingdom fleet for very many years especially and very sadly in terms of loss of life <e> <s> i recognise therefore that it is very important that i give your lordships a full and clear account of my departments response <e> <s> this i propose to do and i shall also take into account one or two points raised in the course of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great interest and very carefully to what my noble friend has said and i would in particular confirm his view about the standards of operation of the bibby line to which he also referred <e>", "<cs> my lords the position on the border with honduras is one which causes a little concern but the major problem is undoubtedly the conflict within the country itself <e> <s> this really is a matter for salvadorians themselves to solve and i could not agree that we should intervene as the noble lord suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure what the noble baroness means by a hostile condemnatory statement <e> <s> we all condemn the violence that is taking place in that country <e> <s> i am wondering whether another loud declaration of that kind would actually get the matter any further forward <e> <s> what is needed is some form of mediation within the country <e> <s> we hope that that is the way in which the matter will in due course be resolved <e>", "<cs> my lords all the european community members have expressed concern at the continuing violence and a wish that a solution be reached through political means <e> <s> i do not think that the european community is best placed to play an active role and it has certainly not been requested to do so by any of the parties <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not sought to belittle or minimise the danger of the situation in el salvador but i would venture to suggest that the sort of intervention that the noble lord is suggesting would not contribute to a solution <e>", "<cs> my lords passport applicants wishing to make short visits to western europe and canada are being encouraged to obtain british visitors passports from main post offices in great britain <e> <s> because the industrial action has been preventing mail being delivered to the passport offices in great britain the public are also being advised to submit urgent applications for standard passports by hand to one of the passport offices <e> <s> these applications are being given the priority required by the applicants date of travel <e> <s> at the liverpool and glasgow offices even this counter service is on a very limited scale because of the extent of the industrial action <e> <s> while the industrial action persists there are no other steps which could be taken to reduce delays in processing passport applications <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose it has to be said that before one can take advantage of the splendid rubric at the front of the passport one must have the passport in ones hand <e> <s> that unfortunately is the problem at the present time <e> <s> but it is the case that the council of the civil service unions indicated that it was not their intention in any way to affect the public by this action and i must say that i fail to see how they can sustain that argument in the present situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot hide from your lordships the fact that this is a very serious situation <e> <s> very many people thousands of people no doubt will in the short term be affected by this industrial action <e> <s> as for government action in the matter if the noble lord means that we should magic some resources out of the air to pay these people yet more money i should have to disagree with him <e> <s> i can say that a little chink of light has emerged in recent days <e> <s> i understand that the chief negotiator on the trade union side has written to my noble friend the lord president and i hope a meeting will be able to be arranged shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can give an undertaking that that can happen <e> <s> certainly each individual case has to be examined on its merits <e> <s> in general terms the immigration authorities need to be satisfied as to the identity of the person concerned <e> <s> if for example a travellers passport expired while he was abroad and he returned to this country i have no doubt that he would be let in if he could satisfy the authorities as to his identity and the fact that he was entitled to enter in normal circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that almost all the passport offices are in fact being picketed to prevent the delivery of mail <e>", "<cs> my lords the core of the effect of the dispute within the passport service is i understand that the senior passport officers who are in normal circumstances required to authorise the issue of particular passports which your lordships will understand is a very skilled and technical matter have been called out on strike <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain the noble and learned lord is right <e> <s> it would be very unwise to leave this country with a passport which is out-of-date or which is just about to expire <e>", "<cs> my lords i much regret that the effect of this dispute has been to inconvenience seriously a number of passengers and a number of proposing travellers <e> <s> i have no doubt that the numbers will greatly increase if the dispute is not shortly resolved <e> <s> it is hard to reconcile this situation with the assertion given by the council of trade unions that they were not proposing to affect the public <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that any of the picketing going on is against the law as my noble friend suggests <e> <s> but if my noble friend has any specific case that he wants the government to look at i shall certainly arrange for that to happen <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it would be going too far to say that passport officers picketing their own place of work were exceeding their legal rights in this matter <e> <s> this is a rather technical legal matter and i would not want your lordships to think that i was offering detailed legal advice <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not able to confirm that discussions will take place next week but i very much hope that they will <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall certainly want to examine all the options but i want to make it clear that a decision to close the consulate has not yet been taken <e> <s> we shall want to take that decision in the light of all the circumstances and in particular the contribution that the consulate makes to our export effort in that part of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not always wise to postpone decisions indefinitely <e> <s> it is our intention to review the position of this particular consulate in the middle of this year as i said <e>", "<cs> my lords i fancy that does go rather wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my noble friend referred to the position in certain subsequent clauses of the bill <e> <s> i hope he will forgive me if i do not go into those in detail now <e> <s> there are amendments down on those points with which we shall deal in due course <e> <s> i turn my attention just to the provisions of this particular clause <e> <s> my noble friend is entirely correct that in reproducing the monopoly we have dropped the penalty of imprisonment which was contained in the earlier legislation <e> <s> it seemed right that the penalty for what is essentially an economic offence should be confined to a fine <e> <s> this also brings the telecommunications monopoly into line with the postal monopoly where imprisonment has never been a penalty for infringement either under section of the post office act or under clause of this bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord mottistone for the way in which he has moved the amendment <e> <s> he will be aware that my own responsibilities at the department of trade have given me a special insight into the british shipbuilding industry and <e>", "<cs> i could see the force of the argument of the noble lord lord lloyd and indeed the argument of my noble friend if it was the case that british telecom were the only people concerned with the grant of licences <e> <s> but of course that is not the case the secretary of state has a role to play as defined in clause <e> <s> i therefore hope that the committee will be satisfied that with the overseeing role which is given to the secretary of state of the day by this clause the commercial interests among others of the applicants for licences are properly safeguarded <e>", "<cs> my lords first i want to thank my noble friends lord mottistone and lord de la warr for their interventions which said much of what i would have wished to have said to your lordships <e> <s> on the question of beesley it is of course the case that we are not debating the beesley report this afternoon <e> <s> the recommendations of the beesley report are not those that are enshrined in this bill because of course as my noble friend said the beesley report appeared long after this bill had started its passage through parliament <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the noble lord lord ponsonby and to the other noble lords who have spoken with much interest but i confess that like my noble friend lord morris i remain unclear exactly what effect the noble lords believe would be achieved by these amendments <e> <s> as has been pointed out their amendment follows the tailpiece to clause but there the effect is clear since disposal of some of bts assets could well impinge on its ability to fulfil its duty <e> <s> this follows from the fact that some parts of bts network are the subject of a number of statutory privileges which would be lost on disposal by virtue of clause <e>", "<cs> i should be misleading the noble lord if i suggested that there was much ground for him to hope we would change our position on the matter <e> <s> the guidelines as he calls them are i submit not guidelines at all but almost a straitjacket and i must reject that concept <e> <s> when discussing an earlier amendment my noble friend lord mottistone complained that the secretary of state might be too closely allied to the views of bt on a related but different issue <e> <s> i think we have it about right in the bill and i would be misleading the noble lord if i gave him any expectation of a change of position by the government on the matter <e>", "<cs> i understand that it has been agreed in the usual channels that now will be a good time to adjourn this committee state and to take other business <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do adjourn during pleasure until minutes past eight <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for his attempt to improve the drafting of the bill and to make the wording more consistent <e> <s> exigible is indeed used in clause which follows section of the post office act <e> <s> however that provision is concerned with payments under schemes which will of course only be payable to bt <e> <s> given this constraint the drafting can be more economical than in clause where licences can require payments to be made to either bt or to the secretary of state <e> <s> clause has to make clear that both can recover sums due to them and this is why it differs from clause <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will see the force of this argument and will see fit not to press his amendment <e>", "<cs> despite a certain amount of levity on this side this debate has raised not for the first <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may deal first with the point made by the noble lord lord caccia <e> <s> there is a definition of a telecommunications system offered in clause of the bill to which the noble lord may care to turn <e> <s> i understand and indeed to a large extent sympathise with the intentions behind these amendments <e> <s> but this amendment would compel the secretary of state or indeed british telecom to grant all applications for licences except on grounds specified in the amendment <e>", "<cs> i must say that i very much agree with the noble lords aim of harmonising the new british standards for telecommunications with the work of relevant international bodies so far as this is practicable and in the national interest <e> <s> i can assure the committee that the government intend relevant international standards to be fully taken into account and that there are means for ensuring this in the procedures of the british standards institution which has <e>", "<cs> i confess i do not know the answer to the question put by the noble lord lord glenamara but i shall certainly undertake to find out and perhaps respond during the discussion on another amendment or later in these proceedings <e>", "<cs> if i may say so i believe that my noble friend has slightly over-simplified the difficulties <e> <s> most of the equipment presently in use belongs as of today to the post office <e> <s> after this bill becomes an act as i hope it will this equipment will then become the property of british telecom and will <e>", "<cs> i must say that at first sight that suggestion seems to present all sorts of difficulties <e> <s> i am afraid that i cannot give any assurance that we will proceed along that route <e> <s> i have no doubt whatever that the expertise available to british telecom will if necessary be available to the bodies to which my noble friend has referred <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord torphichen is asking me to enter into discussion about a technical detail of approval <e> <s> my noble friend is certainly competent to indulge in such a discussion but i fear that i am not <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will forgive me if i do not follow him along that r <e>", "<cs> i would not want the noble lord lord glenamara to go away with that impression in deciding the fate of this amendment <e> <s> i do not believe that i gave such an assurance <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord mottistone has raised important points of principle on this question of liability and i am grateful to him for the moderate way in which he has done so <e> <s> it may be helpful if i make two introductory points <e> <s> the first is to emphasise that the exemption from liability in tort conferred on bt by clause which repeats the corresponding provision of the act is in fact tightly drafted <e> <s> it is confined to failure or delay in the supply of telecommunications apparatus or services and to that alone <e> <s> it does not exempt bt from any other liability in tort due to faults in apparatus for instance any damage or personal injury <e> <s> i ought also to add that this rgime is broadly similar to that in other european countries and in the usa <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble baroness finds my answers on this matter wearisome <e> <s> i suppose i should be out of order if i were to say that i find the questions much the same <e>", "<cs> as for the substance of the supplementary question asked by the noble baroness the problem as she has described it of the bucket shops is not precisely the question on the order paper and is indeed rather a different matter <e> <s> the question whether or not bucket shops should be authorised by the airlines to sell their tickets is a matter for the airlines not for me <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have explained to my noble friend on several occasions and also to the noble baroness lady burton of coventry and to a number of people who have been to see me privately including members of the other place with various delegations the question of legality in this context is a difficult one to solve <e> <s> it is not immediately clear upon what basis the illegality could be founded although i am certain that there is an illegality of some sort <e> <s> the difficulty is to find evidence which will stand up in court <e> <s> as for taking a lead as my noble friend suggests i should do we do indeed take the lead in the bilateral negotiations in which we are involved from time to time for securing a rgime of lower air fares which is certainly the long-term answer to the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords those who produce that sort of line of reasoning are with respect oversimplifying the problem <e> <s> as i have said many times before the air fares which are charged by individual airlines are a matter in the first place for the airlines themselves and subsequently for approval in this country first by the civil aviation authority and then by the government <e> <s> it is not open to me unilaterally to abrogate the agreements which we have entered into with other governments <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend will know iata is an association of airlines and it is for the airlines themselves to decide how they want to order their affairs <e> <s> if they think fit to join iata they have to follow the procedures which it lays down <e> <s> my noble friend is quite right to suggest and indeed to invite me to assure both him and the house that the government do favour a rgime of generally lower air fares <e> <s> we should also favour the removal of some of the restrictions on the sale of air fares generally <e>", "<cs> my lords the sort of difficulties to which i have referred include for example the difficulty of ascertaining who has committed the offence of selling or using an air fare other than the one which is part of the authorised agreement <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord and the house that the difficulties are formidable <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly i agree that the present situation is unsatisfactory but i am persuaded indeed i am quite satisfied that the right answer is to find a rgime of lower air fares which can be sold without many of the awkward restrictions which apply at present <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not short of advice on these matters and i am always pleased to receive <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear i cannot <e> <s> if i had had a better legal framework under which to operate on this matter i think the problem would have been solved <e>", "<cs> i am sure that we are all grateful to the noble lord lord young of dartington for raising this important subject on the rights of the individual in relation to data banks and for the measured way in which he moved his amendment <e> <s> however although i can understand the noble lords concern and indeed the concern of the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran i do not believe that this amendment is the best way to deal with the problem <e>", "<cs> i fear i cannot give the assurance the noble lord seeks <e> <s> my right honourable friend announced his intention in this matter only last march and as i say the convention was signed just a week ago so i doubt that it will be possible although i should be happy to be proved wrong to bring the legislation forward as soon as the noble lord asks me to assure him we shall <e> <s> however i assure him that there will be no unnecessary delay <e>", "<cs> it depends what one means by as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i am not in a position to foreshadow the contents of the next queens speech <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend has pointed out clauses and repeat section of the act and provide that a certificate from bt stating that a specified sum is due to it from a specified person with respect to telecommunications services is to be evidence of that fact in legal proceedings <e> <s> the effect of this is that the court would accept the certificate as correct in the absence of any evidence to the contrary <e> <s> i should like to stress that the court would have to weigh carefully any other evidence brought before it and that a subscriber is quite free to challenge british telecoms certificate <e> <s> it is in no sense conclusive <e>", "<cs> i must confess that i was not quite certain what lay in the mind of my noble friend when he tabled his amendments <e> <s> however i think that i am right in saying that the mere drafting improvement which my noble friend seeks to achieve is in fact not quite so <e> <s> as i understand it the effect of his amendments would indeed go wider than that <e> <s> for example i understand that any agreements made by british telecom for the provision of telecommunication services are confined to its own services but schemes also cover international calls <e> <s> it is not possible therefore to confine clause to services provided solely by british telecom as for example amendment no <e> <s> seeks to do <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will find that explanation satisfactory <e>", "<cs> although i understand the noble lords concern to give local authorities a statutory power to act in accordance with any licence granted under the powers of this bill i do not believe it would be right to do this <e> <s> in saying that i want to make it clear that the government fully support the city council of kingston upon hull to which the noble lord referred in its continuing wish to run a local telephone system for as long as the electorate of that city wishes it so to do <e> <s> however the amendment would give all local authorities from the smallest parish council to the greater london council the power to act in accordance with any licence under this bill that might apply to them <e> <s> that would include all the general strategic licences which we envisage will be granted to all persons covering key areas of liberalisation <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me to interrupt the point i was endeavouring to make and i am sorry if did not make it clearly was that there was a real difference between small firms and small local authorities <e> <s> the difference is that small firms can go bankrupt whereas local authorities cannot <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord young decides what to do with his amendment there are two points that perhaps i may put before your lordships in this matter <e> <s> first your lordships seem to imagine that what hull is doing today any other local authority could do tomorrow <e> <s> the difficulty is of course that hull has been at it for some considerable time and has acquired a good deal of skill and expertise over the <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great care to the arguments of the noble lord lord ponsonby and i understand that his intention and that of his noble friend in tabling the amendment is to allow the post office to provide counter services for private as well as public sector bodies under the new section a of the post office act as inserted by clause of this bill <e> <s> i understand his reasons but i am afraid that i must disagree with them <e>", "<cs> as i said in my remarks just now speaking from memory i cannot be precise about the announcement it was announced on i think th may that certain social security payments would i think from the middle of next year be payable into a bank account at the wish of the recipient <e> <s> of course that will mean that certain payments at present made over post office counters will not in future be made that way <e> <s> i think that reference was made to other payments that might in future be made on a monthly basis or a basis that is less frequent than that at present i confess that i do not have the precise details in front of me and that point relates to the small percentage loss in the number of transactions to which i referred <e> <s> that was also one of the factors which led us to bring forward these proposals which will more than counterbalance the loss which has concerned the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> the matter to which i am referring and on which the noble baroness is questioning me was as i have said the subject of a statement made to your lordships on th may <e> <s> as is normal the statement was in fact a repetition of a statement made in another place <e> <s> i confess that i do not have a copy of the statement before me but the effects of the new arrangements that were then announced are exactly as i said in my earlier remarks and i do not think i can go farther than that <e>", "<cs> let me deal first with the point made by my noble friend lord swinfen <e> <s> the purpose of the special exemption for air couriers as they are called was to enable them to carry on their business <e> <s> i must confess that we were not originally convinced that they would not be able to do so because of certain intentions which we had in mind in respect of a general suspension of the monopoly as regards express mail <e> <s> however we responded to pressure from the air courier companies and as their business is strictly related to the carriage of express mail by aircraft aircraft were included in the bill and there was no need as far as we could see to include ships which were certainly not used for express mail purposes <e>", "<cs> i can confirm that my noble friends fear which he described was covered by the earlier amendment of my noble friend lord gowrie <e> <s> i must also add that there are two further difficulties in the amendment of my noble friend lord morris but in the light of my first assurance i hope that in any event he will not want to proceed further <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me may i suggest that it would be appropriate to consider amendments nos <e> <s> and at the same time <e>", "<cs> in tabling these amendments the noble lord is trying to take away all powers from the secretary of state to make derogations from the postal monopoly whether that be done through licensing under clause or suspension of the monopoly under clause <e> <s> as regards licensing it appears that the noble lord would wish to return to the <e>", "<cs> we are dealing with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> in addition i suggested we might consider this discussion to be covering amendments nos <e> <s> and inclusive and amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> i have as always listened most carefully to the noble lords explanation of this long and complicated set of amendments and i understand him to be saying that these are really modest and reasonable requests <e> <s> however i must say that it seems to me that their effects would be far from modest in terms of the bureaucracy needed to administer them <e> <s> the noble lord said that it was a grave error for the bill not to include any express provisions laying conditions on persons who operate private letter services under a licence issued under clause but we do not believe that such detailed provisions are necessary in primary legislation <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord is quite right to point his finger at all sorts of things which it might be appropriate for licensees to do such as for example putting their name and address and possibly also the telephone number on the communications which they handle but i do not think that what the noble lord is proposing is appropriate for primary legislation like this <e> <s> this is just the sort of thing that perhaps ought to be imposed in certain cases as a condition of the licence that is issued <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i am not in a position to give an undertaking to do that but i will undertake to see whether there is any more information that i can give to the noble lord on this matter by means of private communication between now and the next stage of the bill and then if the noble lord is not satisfied he can raise the matter again on another occasion <e>", "<cs> as i understand it and without considering the matter further i would have to qualify the assurance the noble lords understanding of this matter is correct <e> <s> if i am wrong i will write to the noble lord and let him know <e>", "<cs> under an earlier amendment the noble lord lord winstanley asked me whether certain privatised services would enjoy any exemption from liability as do existing postal services <e> <s> i am now able to give the noble lord a categorical assurance that they will not enjoy any such immunity <e>", "<cs> your lordships will be relieved to hear that we are not to be given the history of the telegraphs since heaven knows when <e> <s> my noble friend has asked about the purpose of the clause <e> <s> the original wording of section of the telegraph act defined telegraph in terms only of wires which are usually made of metal <e> <s> this was in keeping with the technology of the time <e> <s> but british telecommunications are now using optical fibre cables which are made of glass <e> <s> the new definition of telegraph therefore includes optical fibres and therefore ensures that all the legislation covering telegraphs and telegraph works or wires extends to the new optical fibre cables <e>", "<cs> i hope my noble friend will not seek a long and detailed explanation of this <e> <s> we went into the principle of this matter at an earlier stage of the bill and i hope my noble friend will be satisfied with the explanation i gave at that time <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> my noble friend reads too much into the answer that i gave <e> <s> but it may be helpful if i tell him that no less than per cent <e> <s> of our bilateral aid is tied to british exports <e>", "<cs> my lords the benefits of vso which my noble friend has described are certainly very real but i feel that that goes a little wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> doubtless my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords in opening this most timely debate my noble friend lady elles raised a number of general questions about british trade policy <e> <s> i do not think that anyone would dispute the fact that as a nation we live by trade <e> <s> overseas trade amounts to per cent <e> <s> of our gross domestic product more than the comparable figure for any other major country <e> <s> the exchange of goods is generally of benefit to both the supplier and the buyer and as your lordships will know the british government attach high priority to the efforts by british firms to win contracts in overseas markets <e>", "<cs> my lords the views which have been expressed to me have been very wide-ranging <e> <s> it would not be possible for me to identify a single thread running through the representations which i have received <e> <s> as for the nature of the evidence that would be required very briefly we should need proof that the purchaser of the ticket actually travelled on it that he or she actually paid less than the approved fare or that the ticket was purchased without compliance with the advance purchase or other special purchase conditions and that the airlines concerned had connived at the discounted sale <e>", "<cs> my lords the assertion which lies at the heart of my noble friends question is not i think borne out by the facts <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has eloquently enunciated the heart of my policy on this matter <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend that i shall be doing precisely as he suggests <e> <s> your lordships may know that a first document on this matter will be coming from the commission to the council of transport ministers very shortly after we assume the presidency <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first part of the supplementary question asked by the noble baroness the answer is as she put it that not everybody who came to see me was anxious that these tickets should become as widely available as the noble baroness is seeking <e> <s> some people had alternative proposals to make <e> <s> as to whether action will be taken in the event of a suitable case coming before me if there is a case where the evidence is likely in our view to stand up in court we shall wish to take action <e> <s> it is my duty to ensure that the law is properly upheld <e> <s> on the other hand i am not going to authorise the waste of public money on a prosecution which is bound to fail <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so that is a slightly involved supplementary question but the short answer is that we must take all parties with us in these negotiations if we are to reach an acceptable settlement <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is of course quite right that the five need to go forward with a degree of consensus in these matters and of course the position of the united states is crucial <e>", "<cs> my lords the formal position of the united nations in this matter is of course contained in the resolution of the security council and not in the resolution of the general assembly to which my noble friend has referred <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> it is of course the case that the dta was denied a hearing at a recent united nations meeting <e> <s> we expressed our views on that at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords what is important is that the people of namibia should have a chance to decide these things for themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish that i had the mental agility of the noble lord and was able to offer him a comprehensive answer comparable with his supplementary question <e> <s> i would simply say that it is important not to consider each of these matters in isolation but to look for a solution to the whole problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i suggested any such thing as was inherent in the noble lords supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are anxious to adopt an even-handed attitude in this matter and i can assure my noble friend that we are actively concerned to ensure that a solution is found <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble baroness the situation is not as black and white as she <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends concern to secure a settlement to the wider middle east issue is of course well-known but it will not be lost on your lordships i think that the solution to the wider problems in the middle east does not lie in the hands of my noble friend alone <e>", "<cs> my lords the syrian forces in the lebanon are there under a mandate i think from the arab league and that would be a matter for them <e>", "<cs> my lords we have as so often on these occasions listened with the greatest interest to this afternoons debate which has i suggest most certainly done justice to the select committees thoughtful and constructive report <e> <s> as every noble lord who has spoken has already said our debate has been much enhanced by the interventions of the two maiden speakers whom we heard earlier this afternoon <e> <s> i hope as i am sure all your lordships will hope that we shall hear both noble lords again soon and often

hope that they have none in mind <e> <s> as regards afghanistan we remain deeply concerned about the invasion of that country and the continued occupation by the russian troops to which i have referred <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend the foreign secretary has made clear on several occasions the consequences that would flow from a soviet incursion into poland <e> <s> i reiterate and reconfirm everything that my noble friend and indeed my right honourable friend the prime minister have said on that account <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that following their invasion of afghanistan and in the absence of any satisfactory settlement of that matter our relations with the soviet union can never be the same as they were before this monstrous act of aggression <e> <s> we shall <e>", "<cs> my lords we have certainly noticed the condemnation that has been issued on this matter by the non-aligned nations and indeed almost every civilised nation of the world <e> <s> as for a conference that could indeed play a useful role at the right time <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly from time to time indeed regularly we have discussions with the soviet union in various fora about arms control and disarmament matters <e> <s> however since afghanistan those discussions have had to proceed in the light of what has happened in that unhappy country and in the sure knowledge that any proposals that are made in respect of arms control or disarmament have as i have said before in other contexts to be verifiable and effective <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot of course answer for other governments but i can say that the concessional credit arrangements that were formerly available to the soviet union have now been terminated <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the noble lord had a long and distinguished career in the <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to a question by the noble baroness on st may i indicated the nature of the evidence that would be required in order to prove that an offence had been committed by the airline or the agent concerned in the sale of tickets at fares not authorised by the government <e> <s> it is not at all easy to obtain such evidence <e> <s> the mere purchase of a ticket at an alleged discount is not enough more especially if the ticket shows the correct fare <e>", "<cs> my lords i was well aware that the question referred to the answer which i gave the noble baroness on th may <e> <s> i am further aware that the answer which i have just given referred to another answer which i gave to her on st may <e> <s> i assure her that that was deliberately intended because on st may i explained in more detail the matter i had referred to on th may <e> <s> it is quite correct to say that i have received certain documents from an important organisation in the travel trade about this matter which purport to be evidence of illegal discounting <e> <s> but i have to tell the noble baroness that the evidence which has been presented to me so far would not support a prosecution <e>", "<cs> my lords the truth is that there is very little between the noble baroness and myself on this matter <e> <s> i am as anxious as is she to ensure that the law is upheld and i certainly regard it as my duty to see that that happens <e> <s> but according to my legal advisers the evidence which i have received and of which the noble baroness is aware is not such that a prosecution is justified <e> <s> the fact that the purchaser of a ticker holds a receipt which shows that the amount of money that he paid is not the same as the amount shown on the ticket voucher does not necessarily mean that the ticket was sold at a discount <e> <s> i say that because for example the airline might owe something to the potential traveller <e>", "<cs> noble lords laugh but in fact in years past it was a well-known ruse that airlines would enter into certain agreements for advertising with a <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree that some of the fare control arrangements are unsatisfactory <e> <s> that is why we are seeking to produce and to achieve by negotiation with our international partners and indeed with the airlines concerned a more competitive and appropriate rgime of air fares <e> <s> i wish that we had made more progress but we have made a little <e>", "<cs> my lords the difficulty with that suggestion is that it falls within the category of <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords i should be happy to do that <e> <s> however the difficulty is that i can do it only with the agreement of our international partners which so far has proved difficult to obtain <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that nothing has been admitted by alleged offenders <e> <s> but what i want to stop short of is actually offering a detailed and definitive legal opinion on some hypothetical case <e>", "<cs> would that they were only monthly my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe the spanish government intend to honour their obligations and as i said in the main answer they re-affirmed that intention as recently as th march <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not make any connection between spanish accession to the european community and the gibraltar question but as has been said on many occasions spanish accession with the restrictions still in place is inconceivable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i have not been able to help the noble baroness more in this matter but the evidence to which she refers does not i am afraid sustain her suggestion that an effective and successful prosecution could necesarily be mounted <e> <s> one would need to show more to achieve a conviction than that the ticket had been sold over the counter by an agent or by an airline at a price other than the one which was the authorised price <e>", "<cs> my lords that has been the burden of my song in this matter that it is difficult to say in a particular case without looking at the facts whether any noble lord has contravened the various provisions to which i referred <e>", "<cs> no my lords iata is not the governing body of anything <e> <s> it is a trade association of airlines <e> <s> most of the airlines choose to be members of iata and very often airlines proposals for fare increases for example come through iata first to the civil aviation authority and then to my department for approval <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am afraid that i must have misled my noble friend inadvertently <e> <s> iata are not the governing or controlling body of anything <e> <s> iata are governed or controlled if those are the words by their members <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a team of legal advisers within the department who are specifically experienced and qualified in these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the difficulty <e> <s> there is no considerable chance of success <e> <s> there is a very slight chance of success and while the chance of success is so slight i decline to waste public money on a prosecution <e>", "<cs> my lords i could dilate for some time on the powers and constitution of iata <e> <s> i might weary your lordships if i were to do so but my noble friend has got it wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been no prosecution while i have been responsible for these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two answers to that <e> <s> first so far as prosecutions are concerned as i have said before it is my duty to uphold the law in these matters <e> <s> whenever evidence which will sustain a prosecution is brought before me i shall do that <e> <s> but as i have said to your lordships on many occasions the long-term answer to the problem is to secure a more competitive and equitable rgime for air fares generally and that is what we are seeking to achieve <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a prospect which i shall have to face with such fortitude as i can <e> <s> for my noble friend to suggest that the system is illegal is not the position of her majestys government and i shall certainly look forward to hearing what comes from my noble friends complaint <e>", "<cs> my lords i absolutely agree with my noble friend that monopoly situations on air routes or anywhere else are highly undesirable <e> <s> that is why we have been pushing forward within the european community particularly recently with the initiative on air fares which we launched to get a better competitive rgime for member countries within the community and i am hopeful that we shall in due course achieve some success <e>", "<cs> my lords the eec do not fix air fares and as far as i know have no plans or proposals to do so <e> <s> air fares between the member states of the european community as between other states are agreed by the governments concerned upon the recommendations of the relevant airlines <e>", "<cs> my lords no proposals have actually been submitted yet but we expect to receive some proposals in a very short time possibly as early as next week <e> <s> i very much hope there will be a draft directive or regulation included with that document <e>", "<cs> my lords the security council is meeting tomorrow to discuss the attack by israel on nuclear installations in iraq <e> <s> this is clearly connected with wider conflict in the middle east notably the continuing arab-israel dispute <e> <s> we support all constructive attempts to resolve such conflict but doubt whether a conference on the lines suggested by the noble lord would at present have much chance of success <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not certain that it would be wise for a conference to have such a wide-ranging agenda <e> <s> on the arab-israel front we need to establish the basic conditions in terms of israeli and palestinian acceptance of each others rights for example which would allow negotiations on a comprehensive settlement to take place <e> <s> it is worth mentioning of course that there is on the table a soviet proposal for an international conference which <e>", "<cs> my lords iraq is of course a party to the non-proliferation treaty and has accordingly undertaken not to develop or acquire nuclear weapons <e> <s> all her nuclear facilities are subject to international safeguards and she could only develop explosives by breaching or withdrawing from her nuclear nonproliferation treaty obligations <e> <s> i can tell the noble lord that her facilities were inspected by the iaea as recently as last january and found to be entirely in accordance with the undertakings that had been entered into <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we are all deeply concerned about what has been happening in the middle east <e> <s> i should not want to prejudge the outcome of the meeting of the security council which is to take place tomorrow <e> <s> but as for the question of international law we say quite clearly that the israeli actions were contrary to the prohibition in the un charter of the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity of another state <e>", "<cs> my lords the agenda suggested by the noble lord lord brockway was indeed a comprehensive one and a conference as wide-ranging as that would i fear run into some of the difficulties that i have outlined <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a somewhat academic question <e> <s> but on the earlier point that the noble lord put to me about a declaration from the israelis or from the arab countries it is certainly the case that there are difficult positions for each side held by the other and no doubt all of them can make the appropriate declarations in the context of an overall settlement <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of course of the feeling among the various nations of the middle east about some of the others <e> <s> but as for the noble baronesss question as to the possibility of french missiles being sited on the normandy coast that would depend on whom they were aimed at <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly approve the concept of a nuclear free zone in the middle east but i doubt whether it can be attained outside the context of an overall settlement in that part of the world <e> <s> as for the supply of arms to the various countries we need to consider each and every case on its merits <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the argentine state oil company has invited tenders for a block which would cross the median line and we have protested to the argentinians <e> <s> we have since followed up our protest with a notice in a newspaper and several journals to remind companies of her majestys governments position on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly hope that the law of the sea conference will reach a conclusion on this matter although early prospect of that is unlikely <e> <s> in the meantime the matter must be judged by the existing norms of international law <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i shall have to write to my noble friend with that information <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of any strikes as my noble friend puts it having been made but i understand that some seismic surveys have been undertaken <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall need to deal with that situation if and when it arises <e> <s> we shall of course wish to have regard to our rights and the interests of the islanders <e>", "<cs> my lords if i were to recite again the steps which we have taken and which we are taking i fear that i might unduly weary your lordships because i have done so on a number of occasions <e> <s> the noble baroness has tabled an unstarred question for the week after next i believe and i certainly look forward to the chance of giving a full and considered reply on that occasion to the points made by the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords we never believed in setting an arbitrary target for the number of investigations <e> <s> we think that they should not be undertaken lightly <e> <s> we are very satisfied with the careful and responsible way in which the director-general of fair trading has used his new powers <e> <s> we should perhaps remember that these procedures are still very new <e> <s> but as for the question of prices to which my noble friend referred it is of course this governments view that the market forces should much more be allowed to make their effect in this area although there are the powers under section of the act <e>", "<cs> my lords that goes slightly wide of the question on the order paper but the governments concern about this matter is well known <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not have the number of cases in which those procedures have taken place <e> <s> however it is of course true that the director-general has a number of informal contacts with all sides of industry on these matters and of course the very deterrent effect of the powers of the bill are another important factor <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly take note of what my noble friend says <e>", "<cs> my lords i doubt that it will be possible to bring the project forward but i can assure my noble friend that there is no question of any degradation of safety in the absence of this equipment pending its installation in <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not think that is correct <e> <s> it would not be true to say that there would be any enhancement of the safety at gatwick if a second runway was constructed <e> <s> secondly if it were to be constructed and i must confirm that it is government policy that that should not be so there would as the noble baroness rightly points out only indeed be a modest increase in the capacity of the aerodrome <e>", "<cs> my lords i think my noble friend is referring to the annual throughput of passengers which is projected for gatwick in due course <e>", "<cs> my noble friend refers to movements my lords <e> <s> at the present time there are at gatwick if my memory serves me right about movements a year and i certainly cannot offhand think of another aerodrome of that size but then the facilities at gatwick will be very substantially improved between now and when we expect to reach the new targets <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it is true to say that the safety records of airports with this equipment are necessarily better than those without it <e>", "<cs> but the improvement that is provided by this equipment is a more effective use of the facilities because it is obviously possible to maintain the necessary safety standards by procedural means but at a somewhat lower capacity <e>", "<cs> my lords the special session of the unctad committee on shipping to discuss open registries was attended by a united kingdom delegation including advisers from the general council <e>", "<cs> my lords the flag which happens to fly upon the stern of the ship in question is not the factor which determines the seaworthiness of that ship nor is it a factor which determines the competence or otherwise of its crew or indeed their determination to conduct fraud as the noble lord suggests <e> <s> we think that the solution to the problems which the noble lord has described is to secure the wider implementation of international agreements and that is the course which we are following <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not accept that at all <e> <s> the noble lord says that he knows a great deal about this subject and i am certain he does <e> <s> it happens to fall directly within my responsibility within the department so naturally i keep myself as fully informed on these matters as i can although doubtless it will be many years before i can rival the knowledge of the noble lord in these matters <e> <s> in the meantime perhaps i may confirm what i have said before that the way to secure better safety standards better social standards and better commercial standards among the shipping fleets of the world is <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the abuses as i said earlier that we are seeking to correct <e> <s> the abuses i think are less widespread than they used to be <e> <s> but if we seek to correct the situation simply by for example insisting that ships of the nation in question are owned and operated only by nationals of that particular country then we impose upon the shipping companies of the world artificial economic restraints which in terms of british shipping anyway can only lead to less opportunities and less jobs for british seafarers <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said to the noble lord lord wade just now what we also want to achieve is not to impose upon our shipping companies artificial economic restraints which prevent them from operating in the most effective and economic way <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact that a british shipowner chooses to register his ship in some country other than the united kingdom does not mean that he is therefore seeking to get round the safety regulations which i think is what is particularly worrying the noble lord <e> <s> the fact is that the two principal flag-of-convenience states as the noble lord calls them panama and liberia are indeed adherents to all the major safety conventions or are about to become so and enforce them no less rigorously than we do here in this country <e> <s> it is also worth remembering i think that some people refer to the united kingdom flag as a flag of convenience <e> <s> at least one-third of the ships on the british register are not owned by british nationals <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that wimbledon no longer attracts the approval of the noble lord in the way that it did in former years though i am not sure that that is due only to the low-flying aircraft to which he refers <e> <s> however i can assure the noble lord that these permissions are granted only in exceptional circumstances and indeed i think that this permission was the only one granted during this particular period <e>", "<cs> my lords the operator applied for permission to use his own particular aircraft which was a fixed-wing aircraft <e> <s> but as the noble lord will appreciate a helicopter would doubtless cause even more disturbance <e>", "<cs> that is an interesting suggestion my lords but they would then have to listen to the language of the noble lord opposite <e>", "<cs> doubtless my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly ensure that all the correspondence that i receive is replied to as quickly as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords that has been my information too that there have been no oil strikes <e> <s> as i have said there have been two seismic surveys which are not at all the same thing and which simply as i understand it indicate the likelihood or otherwise of oil being present <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the polish debts go wider than just interest charges on debts already incurred for example capital repayments are now due <e> <s> however we shall certainly do what we can within the limits of our resources <e> <s> to follow the earlier supplementary of the noble lord we would of course want to stop short of interfering in polands internal affairs <e>", "<cs> my lords the application to which the noble lord lord brockway refers was in fact made to individual members of the eec including the united <e>", "<cs> my lords under the convention the european commission on human rights does not take a decision <e> <s> such decisions are a matter for the committee of ministers of the council of europe or the european court of human rights <e> <s> in those cases where the united kingdom has been declared to have been in breach of the convention appropriate measures have been taken which are designed to prevent similar breaches <e>", "<cs> yes my lords certainly <e> <s> there have been four decisions by the court concerning breaches by the united kingdom <e> <s> there was the <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in answer to the noble earl lord longford following the <e>", "<cs> my lords the question that i was asked related to the european commission and i answered in connection with the case of mr golder that the prison rules have been modified <e> <s> i think that the point put to me by the noble and learned lord goes rather wide of that <e>", "<cs> my lords the <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly deplore the use of small children for purposes described by my noble friend but of course the press in the united states is just as free as the press in this country and the united states government would therefore be no better able to direct their media than we are <e>", "<cs> my lords the diplomatic staff in the united states who fulfil these tasks are not specifically trained in media promotion activities as my noble friend suggests but they are of course very fully briefed from london and receive the fullest support from the government departments here <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it is true to say that we are losing the propaganda war in the united states <e> <s> informed mainstream opinion particularly in the major united states national newspapers is very much on our side through the columns of their editorials <e>", "<cs> that is certainly our view my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer for american politicians of course but the noble baroness is right to suggest that television is a particular problem and that especially applies to local television in the united states which of course is a very substantial medium there are several thousand small television stations in that country <e> <s> it must be true that they do not all employ the cream of the television reporting industry <e> <s> we do seek to help and brief their film crews as best we can but we cannot of course compel them to report objectively <e>", "<cs> my lords our television companies like the american ones are of course free to broadcast as they think fit <e> <s> but of course the question on the order paper does not refer to that <e>", "<cs> my lords the government efforts in the general propaganda area are as i have already described them but i would not want to go into detail with regard to the government of the republic of ireland which does i think go a little wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not seek to lecture to the americans any more than we appreciate lectures from them <e>", "<cs> my lords the point the noble lord makes through the medium of his supplementary question is very well taken <e> <s> it is not true to say we are losing the propaganda war in the united states <e> <s> mainstream opinion is with us <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i share the view of the noble lord the fact remains however that there is an important job to be done in this area in the united states as elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords discussions were held in london from th june to nd july with a delegation from mauritius including representatives of the ilois <e> <s> we regret that we were unable to reach agreement on our further <e>", "<cs> my lords as for the condition of the ilois in mauritius at the present time it is the case that they have received a wide range of assistance from the mauritius social services since their arrival there <e> <s> in the british government paid to the government of mauritius towards their resettlement and the government of mauritius accepted as full and final settlement that payment as meeting our obligation in this matter <e> <s> indeed when the money was finally disbursed in interest was added to the to make it up to <e> <s> more recently there has been the offer of million to which i referred and finally the additional offer of of aid which my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary offered to them very recently <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the talks are best conducted with those directly involved who are of course the government of mauritius and the representatives of ilois themselves <e> <s> as i said in the original answer we stand ready to continue these discussions when the other parties are ready to do so <e>", "<cs> this amendment would mean that a child adopted by a british citizen would automatically be a british citizen if the adoption was made by a court order and was recognised as valid by a court in the united kingdom <e> <s> this would mean that adoptions overseas by court orders which are later recognised by a court in the united kingdom would confer british citizenship if the child was adopted by a british citizen <e> <s> the process of later recognition by courts in this country seems a somewhat cumbersome procedure and i am not sure whether it was really intended by the noble lord but it is what his amendment seems to say <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first take the point made by the noble lord lord winstanley <e> <s> as i said in the statement and i appreciate that the noble lord may not have had a chance to study it it is the governments intention that british gas should maintain an adequate number of contact points for the public so that the advice to which the noble lord referred and some of the other services and activities which are presently carried out in gas showrooms as for example the payment of gas bills should continue to be possible on a local basis <e> <s> it is the retailing activities on which we have made the decisions which are contained in the main thrust of the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords the five-year period to which i referred in the statement was arrived at after a lot of careful consideration <e> <s> i think that there are dangers in seeking to expedite this process too rapidly <e> <s> that was why we took the decision as we did that the three-year period recommended by the monopolies and mergers commission was unduly hasty <e> <s> there are risks of putting too much property on to the market at the same time although i should say in parenthesis that not all the gas showrooms are held on a freehold basis <e> <s> but having regard to all considerations of that kind we came to the conclusion that five years was the right time <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think there is any contradiction in what i have said <e> <s> british gas will be remaining in the servicing and installation businesses <e> <s> however those businesses are not necessarily conducted from the gas showrooms which are concerned with retailing gas appliances on which less than per cent <e> <s> of the staff time is employed <e> <s> at the gas showrooms there are also certain other activities for example the collecting of accounts <e> <s> those activities will continue at the contact points to which i referred <e>", "<cs> my lords this decision is of course in accordance with the main thrust of conservative policy which was put to the electorate in may and the decision that they took then was a clear one <e>", "<cs> my lords be that as it may the fact is that in our view the consumer is much better served by having a wider range of suppliers from whom he can purchase his equipment than he is by having to go almost exclusively to the showrooms of the british gas corporation which is the situation at present <e> <s> as the report from the mmc showed the results of this monopolistic situation which has existed for a long time now have been that the prices have been kept high and competitive choice available to the consumer has been much less <e> <s> those are the evils that we seek to correct <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in the statement the installation and servicing activities of the british gas corporation are unaffected by the announcement that we have made today <e> <s> however it will continue <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot answer the last point without some consideration <e> <s> i shall write to the noble lord <e> <s> on the wider point of the need for the nationalised industries to operate on a commercial basis we certainly continue to think that that is the right way to proceed <e> <s> in this case that is not what was happening <e> <s> the gas corporation were in an almost wholly monopolisitic situation <e> <s> although as the noble lord lord ponsonby said in the past two or three years there have been a few additional outlets the fact still remains that the british gas corporation had far and away the largest retailing operation in terms of gas appliances <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that the parliament of gibraltar and the leading personalities there have been slow in making their views known <e>", "<cs> my lords the principles of open government to which the noble lord refers and to which of course we also adhere do not extend to publishing confidential memoranda of other governments <e>", "<cs> my lords be that as it may i think that it is rather a matter for the nationality bill which we shall be considering in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords his excellency was in london in march and we made our views clearly known to him then <e>", "<cs> my lords leaks do not come from this government but i must confess <e>", "<cs> but i must confess that any leaks that there may have been in this matter and i am not aware of any come from the other side <e>", "<cs> my lords they are no responsibility of mine <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i will intervene to repeat a statement being made by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for trade in another place <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to both the noble lord and the noble baroness for their measured response to this statement <e> <s> i should perhaps explain that of course the principal purpose of the procedure laid down in the fair trading act and indeed in the conditions which my right honourable friend has now attached to this transfer is to preserve the editorial independence of the newspaper and that i think is what we have achieved by the conditions that have been attached <e> <s> some of the other conditions that people have suggested from time to time though no doubt worthy in themselves did not really contribute to that particular aspect of the matter and that is why it was not thought appropriate to add other conditions some of which have been suggested from very reputable quarters to the transfer that i have announced this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it that would have been a matter for the owners of <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that my noble friend is quite right in that assumption and that certainly the newspaper had been losing money for some time <e> <s> on the other hand my right honourable friend could not have consented to the transfer if it was likely that there would be any serious intervention in the editorial liberty of the editor <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that i fail to see the connection between this decision and what the noble lord refers to as i think the policy of the present labour party <e> <s> but i should say that the company to which the transfer is now to take place george outram and company already own various newspapers including <e>", "<cs> my lords i was only quoting what i thought the noble lord lord kennet had said <e> <s> i am afraid i am not an expert on the policies of the party opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that the house is delighted as i am to have that clarification <e>", "<cs> my lords we have to operate the legislative provisions as we find them <e> <s> i know that there is some thought among the journalists of <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in the penultimate paragraph of the statement and i was quoting my right honourable friend i understand that the new owners the management and the journalistic staff have agreed on a number of other matters to which they attached importance including in particular arrangements for consultation with the journalistic staff on the appointment of independent directors and future editor but not excluding other matters as well <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said twice now our purpose was to secure the editorial freedom of the newspaper <e> <s> relations with the printers are of crucial importance to the future of a newspaper but they did not fall within the ambit of the matters we were considering <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble lord lord ponsonby <e>", "<cs> i should like to begin by dealing with the last point made by my noble friend lady elles <e> <s> of course the bill has special provisions with regard to the avoidance of statelessness which are set out in schedule which your lordships will see on page of the bill <e> <s> i believe that the anxieties of my noble friend on that account are not well founded <e>", "<cs> i have a little more to say yet and i hope that my noble friend will take a more balanced view of the problem when i have finished my remarks <e>", "<cs> the difficulty is of course that the noble lord opposite is asking me to give him a view not on the amendment on the marshalled list but on some future amendment which may be tabled at some later stage of the bill <e> <s> i am sorry but i cannot give him that undertaking because of course i have to see the amendment as proposed <e> <s> therefore i do not think that i could go further than that now <e> <s> the amendments to which i was addressing my arguments was the wider set of amendments tabled by the noble lord lord avebury and the criticisms which i adduced of those were the ones that i ventured to put before your lordships <e>", "<cs> i am not entirely certain to what disadvantages the noble lord refers because the transmission point that he made is not i am advised strictly correct in the terms that the noble lord expressed it <e> <s> i agree that the citizenship under clause which we shall discuss in great detail in a moment and in clause in particular is of course different from the type of citizenship that we are now considering <e> <s> but i do not necessarily accept and nor indeed did my noble and learned friend accept at an earlier moment in your lordships discussions that this is necessarily an inferior citizenship although i accept that it is different <e>", "<cs> just before the noble lord decides what to do i think there may be a misunderstanding <e> <s> of course we will listen to and look at what has been said in the debate in this committee <e> <s> but what the noble lord is putting to us in his amendment is something much wider <e> <s> the european point raised by my noble friend and others is certainly something we can look at but the wider point put by the noble lord is not something that we could agree to <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of re-equipping the queens flight goes if i may say so rather wide of the question on the order paper but i can assure the noble earl that there is no question of any difficulty with the aircraft presently operated by the queens flight and that of course the matters arising from this particular accident have been closely attended to in respect of those aircraft <e>", "<cs> my lords there have been some similar incidents i regret to say in respect of this door fitted to this particular type of aircraft <e> <s> clearly this is a matter which will engage the close attention of the <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is of course quite correct <e> <s> i think or so of this particular type of aircraft or close derivatives of it are in service around the world and have given very remarkable service <e>", "<cs> my lords i did hear what my noble friend said but like his first supplementary it had little to do with the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the views of the noble lord on the brandt commission report i would think were now almost as well known as those of the government <e> <s> i have certainly repeated the governments view on the brandt commission report on a number of occasions from this box <e> <s> as the noble lord said the governments view has also been published in various documents presented to committees in the other place and elsewhere <e> <s> we have welcomed the brandt commission report <e> <s> we share its concern about the problems of the developing world and we shall continue to contribute to a wide range of international action designed to help developing countries <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is of course that as my noble friend has rightly pointed out the brandt report is a very long and comprehensive <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords and the government have expressed a view about some of the particular points and have expressed reservations about others <e>", "<cs> my lords the change to which the noble lord referred in the governments attitude towards the brandt report is i am afraid confined to the mind of the noble lord <e> <s> as for the ottawa conference that is another matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to accept the congratulations of the noble baroness upon our current policy but the difference that she sees between that and the earlier one is largely confined to peoples minds <e>", "<cs> my lords we have always welcomed and i repeat our welcome now public expression of opinion on these matters and public discussion on these matters <e> <s> the lobby to which the noble lord referred was of course part of that public debate <e>", "<cs> my lords the firm date i believe is th september but i shall have to check that and let the noble lord know if i am wrong <e> <s> her majestys government will be represented by my right honourable friend the prime minister <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord knows the brandt commission report contains a very large number of specific proposals <e> <s> we have welcomed many of them and we have expressed reservations about others <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said the calculation that is necessary to arrive at the sort of figures that the noble lord has suggested is a very complex one and we do not think the result would necessarily justify the high level of expenditure that would be entailed <e> <s> it is of course true that every aspect of public expenditure leads to some form of employment directly or indirectly but as i have said it is not possible to make a precise calculation without a great deal of difficulty and expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i would accept that the result of the warrington by-election was determined only by our aid policy <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord seems to forget that we actually spend about million a year on the programme which he describes <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly we examine each and every aid disbursement in a critical way and endeavour to minimise those from which the least benefit flows <e>", "<cs> my lords the regulation of the stock market lies in the hands of the stock exchange council and the other self-regulatory bodies <e> <s> the council for the securities industry promulgated rules on this matter in december <e> <s> they apply to substantial acquisitions of shares in listed companies and they appear to tackle the problem constructively and sensibly <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will appreciate it is of course our policy to rely on the self-regulatory mechanism wherever that is possible but wherever there is a clear failing or shortcoming in the self-regulatory mechanism we are always ready to consider what we can do by way of legislation if that proves necessary <e> <s> indeed there is of course a companies bill going through parliament at the present time in which there is reference to some of these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords in general i would not agree with the noble lord <e> <s> in the broad generality of the case it is necessary for british leyland to purchase their components from the most competitive source <e>", "<cs> my lords it is unhappily the case that industrial disputes of this kind of course cause damage to commercial enterprises of various kinds <e> <s> as for the solution that my noble friend points to that also presents certain difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not the case that this dispute was caused by the reasons that the noble lord described <e> <s> i must confess that i am not immediately aware of the connection with the third test match <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the case of course that the civil servants pay arrangements are normally negotiated to include the affairs of the air traffic controllers and that is an arrangement of long standing as my noble friend knows <e> <s> there may well be some advantages in removing the air traffic controllers from the ambit of the civil service negotiating machinery but of course in the long term we still have to find the money for these extra payments <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a number of difficulties about integrating the air traffic control system of europe <e> <s> there already exists of course the euro-control organisation which goes some way along that line but the principal difficulty in the way of a total integration of the air traffic control system arises from the very different national considerations of each of the major nations concerned not least for example the necessity to integrate civil air traffic with military air traffic control arrangements <e> <s> so far it has proved impossible to overcome these major difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords the report did set out the major difficulties but did not offer a solution <e>", "<cs> my lords doubtless if the social democrats ever achieve office the noble baroness will occupy the position i now hold <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certainly not in favour of airlines doing anything that would lower the safety standards but as i said earlier i am not aware that there has been any case of that during this present dispute <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that my best expectations have not been realised in this matter <e> <s> it is still just possible that we shall be able to say something before the recess but i am afraid i cannot guarantee that <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the past disappointments the noble baroness may forgive me <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will remember the government had to consider a number of reports on this matter including in particular the report from the monopolies and mergers commission a very powerful report the main thrust of which we decided to accept <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly not the case that the interests wishes and views of consumers rank low in the consideration which the present government give to these matters <e> <s> as the noble lord will be aware my honourable friend mrs oppenheim is specially charged with looking after these matters and in my opinion does a very good job <e>", "<cs> my lords the report which the noble baroness lady burton is asking me about is not specifically aimed at the gas industry but goes far wider than that encompassing the position of all the main consumer consultative bodies and the nationalised industries which they represent <e> <s> the question of the gas showrooms is a much narrower one on which your lordships expressed your view when i repeated the statement the other week <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be happy to let the noble baroness know a little way in advance when the announcement is in prospect <e>", "<cs> this amendment falls into two parts and i shall if i may deal with them separately <e> <s> the first would provide a new definition of citizen of the british dependent territories <e> <s> it would be interpreted <e>", "<cs> i shall deal with some of the points raised in the last few moments <e> <s> the main thrust of the amendment is to provide and to create a separate citizenship for each of the dependent territories and the proposal in the second part of the amendment to <e>", "<cs> i apologise for not covering that point <e> <s> i can assure the noble and learned lord that there have been very close consultations with the government of hong kong including in particular of course the governor himself <e>", "<cs> naturally <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is rather difficult to hear <e> <s> i wonder whether he could speak towards a microphone <e>", "<cs> this amendment would seek to give british protected persons the status of commonwealth citizens under the bill <e> <s> as the noble lord has said under our current nationality law british protected persons are neither commonwealth citizens nor aliens and the bill maintains that position <e> <s> they are not covered in this clause and the definition of alien in clause covers anyone who is not a commonwealth citizen nor a british protected person nor a citizen of the republic of ireland <e> <s> so british protected persons are like the irish in enjoying a status peculiar to themselves <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend pointed out there are indeed some dangers that would stem from the amendment if it were to be adopted and i hope to persuade the noble lord not to press it <e> <s> as the noble lord explained this amendment seeks to alter the reference to cyprus in schedule to the bill which lists those countries whose citizens are commonwealth citizens and it would mean that the schedule would no longer refer to the republic of cyprus but merely to cyprus <e> <s> i fear that that would not be appropriate <e> <s> republic of cyprus is the correct designation of that state as laid down in the treaties of which her majestys government is guarantor and it is the republic of cyprus which is recognised as the legitimate government in the island <e> <s> the reference to the republic of cyprus in schedule is therefore the correct one <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord explained this amendment is designed to assist those british overseas citizens who do not have the right of abode either in the united kingdom or any other country <e> <s> it seeks to extend the right of abode in this country to those british overseas citizens who when this bill is passed do not enjoy any right of abode which like the right of abode under the immigration act gives them freedom to live in and to come and go into and from that country without let or hindrance <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord avebury complained about a lack of government sympathy in this matter despite the assurances which we have given to the contrary but the amendment in the name of the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead is asking that we should overnight grant immediate right of abode to something in excess of people who are at present being admitted on a regulated basis in accordance with commitments entered into long ago <e> <s> these people are not being excluded or anything like that <e> <s> indeed voucher-holders have already been admitted and an additional ugandan asians were admitted outside that voucher scheme making a total of people <e> <s> i do not consider that we can be accused of a lack of sympathy in this matter <e> <s> we must have regard to all the considerations relating to the ability of this country to assimilate these people and that directly relates of course to the circumstances in which those people would find themselves if they were all admitted in an unregulated way which is what the noble lord is proposing in his amendment <e> <s> i do not believe that would be the right thing to do <e> <s> it would be unfair to those people and it would be unfair to their colleagues and compatriots already here <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will not press his amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not have the precise figures before me <e> <s> all those people are eligible to apply for vouchers and i understand that the number who are in the pipeline at present is around but i would like to have that figure confirmed and will then write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i will have to check further on this <e>", "<cs> the passport point is not valid because the purposes for which the passport may be used other than to establish the right of abode will not change under the present proposals <e> <s> as for the numbers i understand that the figure which the noble lord lord avebury quoted a moment ago refers to those united kingdom passport holders in india and east africa who are in fact given priority under the special voucher scheme to which i referred earlier <e> <s> the bulk of the remainder in fact i believe all the remainder live in malaysia at the present time and there is no question of the great majority of them as i understand it having any wish to come to this country for residential purposes i think they are by and large people of indian origin <e> <s> i hope the noble lord lord pitt will accept that the main effect of his amendment would be to give to all of those -odd people to whom i referred immediate right of abode in the united kingdom and that is the difficulty which the government see with the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that i have not satisfied the noble lord and i am grateful for this opportunity to try to do so <e> <s> as he rightly observed there are two categories of people within the category he is describing in the amendment <e> <s> one category are those in india and east africa who are subject to the special voucher scheme to which the noble lord lord avebury referred earlier the bulk of the remainder living in malaysia <e> <s> i understand that those who live in malaysia are entitled to and many indeed have malaysian citizenship so there is no question as the noble lord is saying that they have nowhere to go nowhere to live and nowhere to rest their heads <e> <s> the fact is that we have made the arrangements we think rightly in accordance with the necessary circumstances <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to my noble and learned friend <e>", "<cs> i cannot i am afraid off the cuff account for the discrepancy identified by the noble lord lord avebury a moment ago <e> <s> it occurs to me that possibly it has something to do with people who were entitled to united kingdom citizenship but who registered at a later date <e>", "<cs> but if that is not the case i will ascertain the true reason and let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> that is what i meant that they had not applied for their passports and i apologise for not using the proper words <e> <s> i must rest the main objection to the amendment on the point which in essence my noble and learned friend lord rawlinson drew attention to which is that the effect of the amend <e>", "<cs> just before the noble lord withdraws his amendment i wonder whether he would allow me to say that a moment ago i fear i misled him slightly <e> <s> i now understand that the united kingdom and colonies citizens who live in malaysia do not have malaysian citizenship although they are allowed to live there at the present time <e> <s> therefore of course they would indeed be covered by the point made in the noble lords amendment and would i assume be able therefore to come to this country <e>", "<cs> that does not necessarily follow <e>", "<cs> if your lordships will allow me i will as did my noble friend lord teviot paraphrase the remarks i was going to make not only in the interests of brevity but also to alter slightly the thrust of what was originally proposed for me to say to make it more in line with the wishes of my noble friend and indeed of the noble lord lord avebury <e> <s> i want to say first that it is the purpose of these provisions that fees should be charged for searches of home office records primarily <e> <s> i have to admit that the second part of the subsection to which my noble friend referred does not make that entirely clear <e> <s> i agree that for example the words <e>", "<cs> considering the very deep affection which we all have for the people of the falkland islands it is hardly surprising that the question of where they should come in the scheme of citizenship provided for in this bill has aroused strong emotion <e> <s> if i may say so that is as much a tribute to the falkland islands as to those who have spoken so eloquently in this short debate this evening <e> <s> i should like to associate myself with the tribute paid by my noble friend lady vickers to the gallantry and loyalty of the falkland islands during the last war and earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords i want first to thank my noble friend for initiating this debate on the tragic accident which occurred at tenerife in april <e> <s> as my noble friend said in his opening remarks this accident was the worst in the history of british aviation <e> <s> the accident has been the subject of a comprehensive inquiry in which our own accidents investigation branch and american investigators were closely involved <e> <s> as my noble friend has pointed out however my right honourable friend decided that the final report on the accident produced by the spanish commission of investigation should be published with a qualifying addendum <e> <s> this was published on th july and was also attached to the spanish version of the report <e>", "<cs> my lords i of course agree with my noble friend but i am afraid that i cannot confirm that the activities of the people to whom my noble friend referred are included in the statistics which i gave <e>", "<cs> my lords the figure that i gave was calculated in terms of output per person employed although other measures are sometimes used like for example output per operative hour <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the figure that i mentioned speaks for itself but i would certainly confirm the view offered by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said the figure to which i referred in the original answer was calculated in terms of output per person employed and of course the statistics are calculated only by reference to those whose output can be properly measured <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel i must intevene to ask my noble friend this <e> <s> is he actually saying that the government embarked on this programme of changes because the bbcs external services were broadcasting the truth <e> <s> that is what i think he said <e>", "<cs> good <e>", "<cs> my lords may i start by echoing the words of i think almost every noble lord who has spoken in referring to the maiden speech of my noble friend lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> it was as we had expected a splendid maiden speech <e> <s> i very much hope that we shall hear my noble friend again soon and thereafter often in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the reference to which the noble lord refers but i do have the figure of million in front of me which relates to the number of somali speakers in somalia and neighbouring countries and also in some of the surrounding areas as well <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that is correct less than per cent <e> <s> and i believe that the noble lords arithmetic is correct <e> <s> but that is not to say that people are listening all the time that is the number of people who listen occasionally <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords lord caradon and lord hooson and my noble friend lord morris and others referred to the size of the cuts which are being made <e> <s> they were complaining in particular that the modest million could have been recovered by for example saving the cost of two tanks or half a day of subsidy to british leyland <e>", "<cs> the fact is that the same money will buy three transmitters and it is important to switch the resources in that direction <e> <s> the noble lord lord crowther-hunt asked why we could not find savings from the rest of the foreign and commonwealth office vote and i believe this point was echoed by the noble lord lord hooson <e> <s> the cut announced in and affected the diplomatic service and overseas aid more than the bbcs grant in aid <e> <s> since st april the number of diplomatic service staff has declined by per cent <e> <s> fifteen posts have been closed and eight posts have been reduced <e> <s> staff at the largest posts have been reduced by per cent <e> <s> since half the consulates which we had abroad have been closed <e> <s> in the same period diplomatic service staff have been reduced by per cent <e> <s> from to the bbcs external services staff which has comparable numbers suffered a reduction of only per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly be willing to write to the noble lord with the specific information about the madrid embassy but if i may i should like also to deal with the constitutional point which the noble lord lord crowther-hunt and i think at least one other noble lord raised <e> <s> under clause of the licence agreement annexed to the bbcs royal charter it is stated <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall make inquiries and if i have anything to tell the noble lord i shall write to him <e>", "<cs> certainly my lords <e> <s> my noble friend my honourable friends and indeed myself from this dispatch box have often reiterated the governments acceptance of the need for multilateral disarmament in accordance with the various points we have made on that issue from time to time but with regard to the matter to which the noble lord refers in his question it is not part of government policy to orchestrate public opinion in these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords we do a good deal more than to touch on these matters <e> <s> if i may refer to what was done last year during disarmament week a number of documents were published my noble friend made an important speech to the united nations association during the disarmament week last year and none of us loses any opportunity to express government views on these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords verification is an important part of the posture that we adopt in these matters but i think it is unwise to give any hostages to fortune by offering categorical assurances on particular matters in advance of knowing the circumstances of the occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords we lose no opportunity of doing that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think if i may say so that that is slightly exaggerating the position but <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord would have to pose that question to those to whom he refers <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord belstead is constrained by the rules of the house from speaking yet again on this matter <e> <s> he is prepared to ponder upon it pending consideration of the related amendment but i ought to say that the likelihood of any further concession is fairly remote <e>", "<cs> my lords of course my intervention now will not preclude my noble friend intervening later if he feels that he would like to do so <e> <s> i should like to begin by paying tribute to my noble friend lady vickers for the way in which she has presented her case for the peoples of the falkland islands <e> <s> she has indeed again on this occasion presented their cause most cogently her concern for their well-being a concern which i know is shared in almost every part of your lordships house has again been impressively displayed <e> <s> the amendment that she proposes seeks to provide for the acquisition of british citizenship not only by those born in the falklands after commencement but also by those alive immediately before commencement who have ties with the falkland islands through their residence there or because one of their parents was settled there <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment and those which are related to it that is to say amendments nos <e> <s> and would mean that each dependent territory would have its separate citizenship <e> <s> the secretary of state would by order make a scheme of citizenship for each dependent territory which as the noble and learned lord has explained would be subject to parliamentary approval and the bill could not come into force until this had been done <e> <s> in other words we should need to negotiate and obtain parliamentary approval for some or more citizenships before the bill could come into force <e> <s> the noble and learned lord did not explain what would happen if parliamentary approval was not obtained <e> <s> the composite citizenship of the british dependent territories in part ii of the bill would thus disappear <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that we see the same difficulties in these amendments as we did in the equivalent amendments to clause to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> perhaps i may as briefly as possible remind your lordships of those difficulties <e> <s> first there is the problem that the drafting of the discretionary power is not as appropriate in the context of clause as it was in its original context of clauses and <e> <s> it refers to the power not being exercised <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to underestimate the importance of the various publications i have referred to but the proper answer to the difficulties terrible threats and risks to which the noble lord refers is the effective moving forward of the various arms control and disarmament negotiations which are in prospect at the present time <e> <s> the tnf talks will begin at the end of november the mbfr talks are going on in vienna but not achieving much progress and above all there is the forthcoming resumption of the csce review conference in madrid where the french conference on disarmament proposals will be top of the agenda <e>", "<cs> my lords the policy which we seek to follow is to provide adequate security for our country and above all to contribute as best we can to the deterrents offered by the western alliance <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend well knows and i suspect is inviting me to say it is exceedingly difficult to get such documents circulated behind the iron curtain that is why the csce process is important <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not so much a matter of getting them circulated there are plenty of copies available for anyone that asks <e> <s> the problem is to get people to read them <e>", "<cs> a very substantial proportion my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the documents i have referred to serve a useful if limited purpose but one does not want to overestimate or underestimate the effects that they can achieve <e>", "<cs> my lords what is broadcast on the world service of the bbc is a matter for the bbc itself <e> <s> i do not have any influence over that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not certain quite what it is intended to put in the next edition of the arms control and disarmament newsletter to which i have referred but it may be that such a summary could find a place there <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear with respect that the noble lord is viewing the situation in the middle east through somewhat rose-tinted spectacles <e> <s> there are two fundamental difficulties which remain to be resolved the first being that the plo must accept israels right to exist and the second being that the plo must themselves be incorporated into the consultative and negotiative process <e>", "<cs> yes i had noticed that my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i acknowledge the appreciative words of the noble lord about my noble friend the foreign and commonwealth secretary <e> <s> but the noble lord went on to suggest that agreement had been reached i think he put it between the plo and israel <e> <s> that is i fear going too far <e> <s> that really is not the case yet although i hope it will be one day <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that the consensus to which the noble lord refers actually exists in reality <e> <s> i doubt whether such a consensus would be achieved among the members of the security council to whom the noble lord suggested in his question this matter should be referred <e> <s> as for the wider international conference the problem is that there are two fundamental differences to which i referred earlier <e> <s> i believe these at least should be resolved in the context of moving the matter forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that one needs to be wary of over-simplifying the issues in this matter <e> <s> naturally the arabs are a crucial part of this negotiative process and we have noted the eight points which were put forward by the saudi government recently some of which seem to offer at least part of a way forward <e>", "<cs> my lords when and if that happens we shall indeed have made progress <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is right in what she recalls of the words of mr arafat at the united nations some years ago but the hope is that their position will change and move forward <e>", "<cs> my lords although this amendment does not specifically refer to hong kong my noble friend lord geddes has not sought to hide his particular concern for the people of that territory and indeed i would commend him for his single-minded pursuit of their interests as he sees them during the passage of this bill <e> <s> of course he has enjoyed no small measure of support here this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission perhaps i may intervene in order to deal with two of the points made by my noble friend lord drumalbyn <e> <s> first my noble friend castigated me for saying that the concept of british national is not something known to our domestic law <e> <s> i stand by that <e> <s> it is most certainly not <e> <s> this bill is a british nationality bill <e> <s> the word nationality does not appear in the amendment and indeed it was not the word that i used when i said that the concept of british national was not known to our domestic law <e>", "<cs> my lords if i have the leave of your lordships to speak yet again the fundamental difficulty with this amendment is that it will create uncertainty and doubt in the minds of those to whom the terms of the amendment would apply and i have to say this in plain terms would i believe imply some sort of eventual immigration commitment in the minds of some less informed people <e> <s> that is the principal difficulty which we face <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord said the amendment seeks to alter the description of the territories listed in schedule to british associated territories and i presume it is his intention that the change should be carried through elsewhere in the bill and that citizens of the british dependent territories would then be known as citizens of british associated territories <e> <s> we have carefully considered this change but we see some difficulties in it <e> <s> for one thing to refer to the dependent territories as associated territories would lead to confusion as the noble lord rightly apprehended because as your lordships will know certain dependent territories in the caribbean are known as associated states which is slightly different from what the noble lord was referring to <e> <s> they enjoy a considerable degree of self-government and differ significantly from other dependent territories <e> <s> it might well be assumed that in making the proposed change we had it in mind to alter the status of other dependencies to put them on a par with the associated status <e> <s> this is of course not so but there would undoubtedly be scope for uncertainty and misunderstanding which i believe could be harmful to some of the dependencies <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say at the outset that i have a slight feeling of <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that over the three years as i said in the original answer the ecgd has had to meet very considerable claims and indeed is continuing to do so <e> <s> it has been the policy of consecutive administrations of both political complexions that the ecgd should operate on a basis of no charge on the public funds for its day-to-day credit reinsurance operations <e> <s> that is why it has been necessary to increase the level of charges <e>", "<cs> my lords the claims upon the ecgd result from the shortcomings of other governments not ours <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of a debate on this or any other matter is of course something to be decided by the usual channels and not for me <e> <s> but of course i stand ready to answer whatever debate your lordships wish to initiate and which is down for me to reply to <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is fair to say that the recent difficulties in which the ecgd has found itself result largely from the effects of the world recession <e> <s> but it is also worth saying that one of the specific difficulties that it met was the special case of iran which imposed burdens of something like million upon the ecgd and which is of course a very substantial part of the deficit to which i have referred <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly appropriate that the reserves ought to be at an adequate level <e> <s> in that context it is worth saying that the present risks to which the ecgd is exposed are something of the order of million <e>", "<cs> my lords the arrangements in other countries are not always exactly in parallel with ours <e> <s> but i understand that the export credit guarantee arrangements of some of our european colleagues are at least as difficult as our own <e>", "<cs> my lords british subjects resident in zimbabwe many of whom are also citizens of zimbabwe are subject to the normal exchange control regulations of that country <e> <s> the current foreign exchange shortage has compelled the zimbabwe government to continue and in some cases to strengthen the exchange controls which they inherited on independence <e> <s> however the zimbabwe authorities have assured her majestys government that they intend to relax the controls as soon as financial circumstances permit and that they will consider sympathetically any cases of individual hardship <e>", "<cs> my lords the export of capital from zimbabwe is indeed subject to certain restraints but of course that is not unique to zimbabwe <e> <s> many countries have exchange control regulations indeed we ourselves did until comparatively recently <e> <s> as for the export of goods to which my noble friend referred it is the case that certain regulations have recently been introduced relating to the export of capital goods from zimbabwe and when i say capital goods i am referring to household capital goods such as refrigerators deep freezers and the like <e> <s> the zimbabwe authorities have stated that emigrants had been exporting newly purchased items of this kind for resale outside zimbabwe in order to evade exchange control regulations and i imagine that it is for those reasons that these controls were introduced <e> <s> as for insurance polices to which my noble friend also referred i imagine that the proceeds from an insurance policy will be subject to the same regulations as capital sums generally <e>", "<cs> my lords that is indeed correct but it is the case that my noble friend has had a continuing interest in this matter and it was of course one of the things discussed at the lancaster house conference <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very careful not to link those two things <e> <s> the purpose of our aid contributions to zimbabwe and indeed to any other country is to help them build up and improve their commercial and economic infrastructure and no good purpose will be served i suggest by linking those two matters <e>", "<cs> my lords there i think is a misconception <e> <s> the civil service in rhodesia as it then was was not recruited in the united kingdom but generally speaking was recruited locally <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the south african ambassador called upon the then lord privy seal on th august to complain about the programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not seen the film but i have no doubt that what the noble lord has said is right as to what the film contained <e> <s> my right honourable friend the then lord privy seal told the ambassador that her majestys government have no control over the content of television programmes <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that the ambassador knows that already <e>", "<cs> my lords this matter arose just before the south african incursion into angola but i have no doubt that the point again was not lost on his excellency <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the two are in any way comparable <e> <s> in any event the simple fact remains that we have no control over these television programmes <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord chalfont did refer to what he described as inaccuracies and errors in the film about which the south africans were complaining <e> <s> it is no part of my job to defend that film which in fact i did not see but i do take the point of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that we get complaints from all sides about the content of television programmes press articles and so on <e> <s> i suspect that we get it about right <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord well knows the answer to that question as i said in the original answer and in my first or second supplementary the government have no control over the content of television programmes and certainly seek none <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord describes the governments concern in this matter very succinctly and i certainly give him the assurance for which he asked in the second part of his supplementary <e>", "<cs> with respect my lords that is a somewhat comprehensive supplementary to this question but i can take the point made by the noble lord about the soviet union <e> <s> it is certainly our wish that the polish government and the polish people should be allowed to resolve their problems without intervention from outside of any kind whatsoever <e>", "<cs> my lords we are certainly doing what we can within the limits of our resources naturally to assist the poles at this difficult time <e> <s> indeed the record to which i referred in the original answer bears witness to that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is right when he suggests which i think is the implication of his supplementary that the long-term solution to polands problems is the regeneration of their economy and their ability to produce more to service their quite considerable outside debt <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> so far as i know none of the debts owed to western governments or western hanks is guaranteed by the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in the original answer the question of rescheduling the debt repayments and interest repayments has yet to be agreed upon finally but it is certainly being considered <e> <s> however an important feature of that will certainly be the plans which the poles themselves are now working on which relate to the improvement of their own economic prospects <e>", "<cs> my lords the proposals which we support are those which are best calculated in our view to achieve some measurable success in the area to which the noble lord has referred <e> <s> as i have said very often from this box our aim in this matter and the noble lord has acknowledged it is to achieve balanced and verifiable measures of disarmament <e> <s> our policy within those constraints is to achieve individual elements of disarmament rather than the sort <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly hope that progress will be made long before but rather along the course which i have suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords there are of course a number of conferences in the disarmament fora going on at present <e> <s> as for the question of chemical warfare which my noble friend has raised we are very much in favour as he well knows of a convention to ban chemical warfare <e>", "<cs> my lords the existing convention on chemical warfare dates back i think to <e> <s> a number of shortcomings have not unnaturally been found to exist in that particular convention <e> <s> i do not think it is yet the case that we have reached the point of ratifying a new convention but we hope that this will occur before long <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that that was the precise implication of my noble friends earlier supplementary question but it is certainly the case that the soviet union possesses a very substantial chemical warfare capability <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier we consider that progress in these matters is best achieved by negotiations between the nuclear states themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that a proposal along those lines has been made by the soviet union but we need to evaluate it rather more fully

of these types of proposals and there are a number of proposals which are discussed from time to time from the point of view of our own security among other things and our security would most

referred which are to begin at the end of november will make some progress on the matters which will be under discussion <e> <s> but the proposal contained in the question of the noble lord lord

motivation behind the actions of the soviet union butt have to agree that the main thrust of my noble friends supplementary is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is suggesting some new form of verification certainly the government will be prepared to look at that along <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know about that but the fact remains that whatever assessment is used the soviet strength in conventional forces and tanks and other weapons in this theatre is very substantial and vastly exceeds that of the western allies <e>", "<cs> my lords the civil aviation authority tell me

"<cs> my lords the use of mogas continues to be studied carefully <e> <s> however there are i understand a number of safety problems <e> <s> one of the other aspects causing difficulty is the understandable reluctance of the engine manufacturers to allow their engines to be re-rated for a type of fuel where the quality control might be less stringent than for avgas <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a good deal in what the noble lord says about this but as for my getting hold of the cards close to the chest of my right honourable friend i doubt whether i should have much more success than the noble lord did with his chancellor in his day <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that different governments approach their fiscal problems in different ways which is doubtless one of the matters which affects the price of avgas in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will recall from my previous answers that the performance of the ecgd generally in these matters not only in regard to this particular type of policy to which the noble lord refers but also to the other types which it writes has been less than satisfactory <e> <s> but in regard to this type of policy which is the subject of the question it might be worthwhile my pointing out that of p worth of premiums that it took on an actuarial basis it paid out no less than p in claims of one kind or another and clearly disparities of that sort had to be corrected <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend puts his finger on the nub of the problem that is that it is the world recession which is the principal cause of the difficulties in which the ecgd has found itself <e> <s> but it is not the only cause <e> <s> one of the other causes has been the disparity between premium rates and claims performance and it is that latter disparity which we sought to correct with the recent rate adjustment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have in front of me the precise figure of what is spent upon investigations <e> <s> i shall ascertain that figure if i can and write to the noble lord with it <e> <s> but of course the ecgds general policy in these matters must be related to its claims experience <e>", "<cs> my lords i venture to suggest that the conduct of the affairs of the ecgd under my noble friend was particularly exemplary <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are anxious to prevent an arms race in outer space and are examining the soviet proposal to see whether it will contribute to that end <e> <s> we are discussing the matter with our partners and allies to see what progress can be made <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord rightly pointed out that the treaty extended only to weapons of so-called mass destruction and he went on to ask why that treaty should not be extended to cover other weapons <e> <s> it may be that the treaty should be extended as the noble lord suggests but we shall need to be sure that if it is so extended it will not unduly affect our strategic position <e> <s> as to the question of the shuttle to which the noble lord went on to refer i have no knowledge or indication that the shuttle is intended for anything other than peaceful purposes but it would be covered i think by the present proposals in the document which the soviets have put forward <e>", "<cs> my lords although so far as i know there is no inhibition upon states to enter outer space as the noble lord says there is some disagreement as to precisely what is meant by the words outer space that is how far from the surface of the earth it commences <e> <s> but clearly there is no difficulty over nations agreeing among themselves not to use outer space for particular purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is referring to the recent television programme about the use of laser weapons in outer space i would say that they represent a technology which is not yet with us <e> <s> as to the question of the trident the government are satisfied that the trident system provides an excellent margin of insurance against future anti-ballistic missile developments <e>", "<cs> my lords we hardly need to consult with the swedes to reach a view on that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords when i said in answer to the noble lord lord shinwell that the meaning of the expression outer space was not precisely clear i meant of course that it is not described precisely in the treaty to which the noble lord lord brockway referred <e> <s> as to the uses of the shuttle that is really a matter for the united states government and i would not want to discuss the budgetary dispositions of that government to which the noble lord referred but clearly the essential uses of that vehicle are peaceful <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that the noble viscount has some element of truth in what he says <e>", "<cs> my lords i never said that <e>", "<cs> my lords the military flavour of soviet space operations is of course well known but that is a matter for them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i cannot <e> <s> however it is not necessarily the case that all the launches effected by the department of defense in the united states are for military purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that this is an important matter <e> <s> i fancy that the best way forward following the recent soviet proposals would be by means of bilateral discussions between the united states and the soviet union although the united kingdom will naturally be ready to play its part if appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that there is a view of which the noble lord is a distinguished proponent which is at variance with the government view but i venture to suggest that those who hold that view are mistaken <e>", "<cs> my lords that is certainly the government position <e>", "<cs> my lords the russian superiority in convention forces is well known <e> <s> they have the advantage do they not <e> <s> of being able to dragoon their citizens into taking part in their miltiary organisations and of course that is not the case so far as we are concerned <e> <s> as the noble lord will well know our posture is one of flexible response and that is the way i think it should remain <e>", "<cs> my lords it is of course the case that the recent incident of the soviet submarine which entered swedish territorial waters will be a salutary experience for the nations of that region <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly the case that the soviet union hastened to embrace proposals which leave their security unimpared while ours is degraded <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not seen the speech to which the right reverend prelate refers but i shall hasten to obtain a copy <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the soviet proposal does not go that far <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord refers to the rapid growth of nuclear weapons in western europe <e> <s> the fact is that the growth of nuclear weapons on the soviet side of the iron curtain is even more rapid <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has put his finger on a crucial feature of the negotiations taking place now and which will take place in the near future <e> <s> that is that anything we agree with the soviets in this field must include a provision for adequate verification <e>", "<cs> my lords we will certainly agree to balanced measures of nuclear disarmament when it can be shown that we are not thereby put at a disadvantage and that whatever we do agree can be as i said earlier properly verified <e>", "<cs> my lords not for the first time we have detected an element of ambiguity in figures put forward by the soviets <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer either for the greek government or for president kyprianou nor i fear can i comment on the details to which the noble lord referred which doubtless he has obtained from some unofficial source <e>", "<cs> my lords the opening part of the noble lords supplementary question of course puts one view of this problem <e> <s> as for an intervention by my noble friend i think it is important that we do nothing to cut across the present united nations initiative and the current intercommunal talks <e> <s> but we are ready to help in any way that the united nations or the parties may find useful <e>", "<cs> my lords our anxiety to see a solution to this matter is no less acute because of our position as a guarantor power <e> <s> but i say again that i think it is necessary for the proper procedures to be advanced in this matter <e> <s> the united nations have made significant progress in recent months and weeks and i think it would be wrong if we were now to try to cut across that procedure without at least a clear indication from the parties that that was their wish <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised to hear the noble lord speaking in those terms <e> <s> these proposals have only just been tabled <e> <s> no party has yet indicated its acceptance or rejection of the proposals and to speak in the terms in which the noble lord has spoken is not i suggest conducive to moving the matter forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say it would be improper i said it would be inappropriate <e> <s> we judge our actions in these matters by the criterion in which way do we think these matters can best be moved forward <e> <s> our judgment is that it is better for the present to allow the united nations initiative to run forward rather than for us to intervene as noble lords suggest <e>", "<cs> my lords the progress that has been made in recent weeks and months principally through the medium of the secretary generals special representative in the area has been quite significant <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the government would not deliberately wish to do as the noble lord suggests but i ought perhaps to make it clear that although the spanish and portuguese airlines continue to operate their services from heathrow those services are subject to strict capacity limits <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is not correct in that assertion <e> <s> the fact of the matter is of course that heathrow is approaching the capacity limit which it can accept and for that reason the government have maintained the policy which was originally initiated indeed by the previous administration to impose restraint upon the growth of services from heathrow <e>", "<cs> my lords that is i think another question but in any event it is a matter for british airways themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly the case that stansted has certain capacity available at present but there is no existing policy of directing traffic to move to that airport <e>", "<cs> my lords there is certainly room for argument about such figures although i have no reason to quarrel with the figures that british airways have put forward <e> <s> but the fact remains as i said earlier that spanish and portuguese airlines will themselves be subject to some restraints and hence doubtless financial penalties as and when the traffic approaches the maximum that they are permitted to carry <e>", "<cs> my lords tap and iberian airlines the spanish carrier would even now certainly be welcome to operate from gatwick but they prefer to operate from heathrow <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend the foreign and commonwealth secretary went to saudi arabia in his capacity as president of the ten in order to talk with saudi leaders about crown prince fahds eight principles and other issues of mutual interest <e> <s> the ten have welcomed the principles as a positive contribution to the search for middle east peace <e> <s> he was encouraged by his constructive discussions with the saudis who are committed to the search for progress towards a peaceful settlement <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is right to suggest that these principles have received widespread acceptance not only among the arab world but also elsewhere <e> <s> as for a conference it may well be that a conference will be appropriate at some stage but i would say that it is a little early to be thinking in those terms at this moment not least because it is so necessary that any such conference should be properly prepared <e>", "<cs> my lords the seventh of the eight principles says that all the states in the region should be able to live in peace and we most certainly regard that as including israel <e> <s> we have no reason to believe that this is not the saudi point of view as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only reflect the discussions of my noble friend when he was in riyadh recently and repeat the words that i used just now that we have no reason to believe that the saudi point of view is not as i described it <e>", "<cs> my lords nothing in the saudi eight points or for that matter in the european venice declaration is intended to cut across the camp david process <e> <s> the camp david process has a number of important achievements to its credit not least the institution of peace between israel and egypt the forthcoming withdrawal from sinai by the israelis and the talks to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> but one needs to look ahead a stage further than the camp david process and i think that the various initiatives to which i have referred the saudi initiative and the european initiative can be seen in that light <e>", "<cs> my lords it is unhappily the case that the israelis have not so far felt able to accept the main thrust of the saudi points but i hope that on reflection they will be able to reconsider their position <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may just deal with those two points <e> <s> first on the question of jerusalem i suggest that it is unconducive if that is good english to taking forward the peace process in the middle east if one side or the other takes up some position set in concrete on some point which they know very well is unacceptable to the other side <e> <s> that most certainly applies to both sides in this discussion <e> <s> as for the position of the plo as my noble friend has said on several occasions it is unrealistic to imagine that progress will be made in the middle east without some acknowledgment of the position of the plo as representing a very important segment of palestinian opinion <e> <s> but certainly it is essential for the plo to recognise the existence of the state of israel and the right of the state of israel to exist and we hope that they will do so <e>", "<cs> my lords it is inevitably the case that the plo at various levels come to hear of the various proposals that we have to make in these matters but we most certainly do not have formal discussions with the plo in the way that the noble lord is suggesting <e>", "<cs> my lords no agreement has yet been reached on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord that the history of the pol pot rgime is quite appalling but frankly the position we have to adopt in connection with the united nations seat which is the subject of the noble lords question is the lesser of two evils <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not recognise governments at all nowadays we recognise the existence of states so the question of recognising one government or another in cambodia does not arise <e>", "<cs> no my lords it was used by the noble lord opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact remains that the vietnamese puppet government in cambodia which is what it is arrived there at the tail of a column of troops and that is not the sort of thing to which we can give any kind of approval <e>", "<cs> my lords i could detain your lordships for a considerable time with a dissertation on that topic <e> <s> suffice it to say that in the context of political co-operation among the council of ministers with which the noble lord will be familiar there is now some discussion on the political aspects of security which i hope go some way to meet the anxieties of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a matter for the managements of the airports concerned <e> <s> the general position of her majestys government in these matters is that we seek to achieve a competitive environment in these things and the arrangements at schiphol are clearly part of that <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have explained i think on numerous occasions to the noble baroness this is not a question of national legislation but a question of agreement between the governments concerned <e> <s> i am not in a position to comment upon the agreements between the government of holland and the other governments with which they do business <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite certain that there is no provision in dutch law to allow things which are contrary to international agreements <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i can do that arithmetic in my head but certainly the economy fares offered by british caledonian and british airways between london and hong kong for example are between per cent <e> <s> and per cent lower than the economy fares from schiphol <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord <e> <s> unfair competition is certainly not part of our policy and is not something we seek to achieve <e> <s> that is why we were at pains to ascertain from the dutch government that there was no question of any subsidy so far as klm were concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords as a former pilot i welcome what the noble lord says <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no formal requirement that the baa should finance any given percentage of its capital investment from revenue <e> <s> as with other similar nationalised industries the authority is expected to earn the required rate of return on new investment and this will substantially determine the internal revenue of the authority <e> <s> its external financing requirement will vary from year to year according to the difference between its capital requirements and its internally generated resources <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that the baa ought to be operated as efficiently as is possible and although i would not claim that the authority is perfect in that respect it has a very creditable and defensible record <e> <s> but what i think my noble friend is really asking for is some amelioration for the airlines which goes wider than mere internal efficiency in the authority <e> <s> that would mean a subsidy from public funds which i cannot countenance <e>", "<cs> my lords that is one of the possibilities that we examine from time to time <e> <s> however it would have no effect upon the costs of the british airports authority and thus its ultimate charges <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that the fees of the british airports authority are among the higher charges for their type of services in the world <e> <s> on the other hand it is one of the few airport authorities which operates without a subsidy <e>", "<cs> no my lords i would not agree with that <e> <s> the terminal charges as they are called at british airports which relate to the total cost of course of british airlines represent something less than per cent <e> <s> of their total costs <e>", "<cs> my lords that is already the case <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have just explained to the noble earl lord amherst the noble baroness is not correct <e>", "<cs> oh <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be glad to know when my noble friend said that <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that i should be glad to know when my noble friend lord carrington made the observation which my noble friend lord morris has ascribed to him <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord heard of the british council and is he aware what that costs the foreign office <e>", "<cs> my lords at the outset i wish to apologise for the inadequacy of my vocal chords this evening <e> <s> i recall once before a year or so ago when in a similar predicament saying to your lordships that if i conked out my noble friend lord long sitting beside me would jump up and continue with the speech that i had prepared and i hope that my noble friend will feel able to do that again this evening should the need arise <e>", "<cs> my lords on the latter point that the noble lord has made on the petition which was presented to the embassy in madrid i am not certain how far some of the people who subscribed to that petition had in fact been asked to do so by sources outside spain <e> <s> turning now to the transcription service our intention was to halve the subsidy which at current prices is running at well over million per annum <e> <s> this is a matter which greatly worried the noble lord lord ardwick and i think indeed the noble lord lord strabolgi <e> <s> in fact thanks to the bbc finding savings from overheads we have been able to agree that the subsidy need not be reduced by as much as a half <e> <s> i was happy to see that the managing director of the external services was reported in the bbc house journal <e>", "<cs> my lords i am coming to that now and i think that in a moment i will cover the point that the noble lord has raised <e> <s> we are confident that a respectable service will continue based on an existing library of hours of recorded material and continuing current production made in the ordinary course of events for both the domestic and overseas programmes of the bbc from which it should be possible to make sales <e> <s> again this is a question of priorities and we consider that some of the money previously available to the transcription services would be better employed in the capital programme <e> <s> within the remaining half of the transcription services <e>", "<cs> my lords i am talking about the topical tapes service within the transcsription service <e> <s> the total output of the transcription service including the topical tapes services is to be reduced by about per cent <e> <s> as i said not per cent <e> <s> naturally there will be some reduction in staff following the reduction in subsidy but we are satisfied that the output which i have described will be possible with the remaining staff having regard to some productivity and other considerations which can be brought to bear <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said we are proposing to reduce the subsidy by about per cent <e> <s> that is not the same as was originally proposed <e> <s> as for the service moving to a self-financing position we certainly hope that the service will in certain instances be able to increase the revenue it earns perhaps in some cases though doubtless not in all by for example raising the charges they make for their services <e> <s> but i do not think that i can go further than say what i have already said which is that we are reducing the subsidy by half and from that it must follow that we are not for the moment proposing that it should proceed to a totally self-financing basis <e>", "<cs> my lords the points made by the noble lord were on the same theme but i accept that that was not the precise point he made on this occasion <e> <s> but it was the theme of my noble friend lord morris and at least one other noble lord so that i thought that an answer would satisfy three noble lords rather than delay each of them with separate replies <e> <s> since the bbc spanish service broadcasts for only one hour a day it is just as likely that the spaniards turned to the bbc -hour world service in english when their own service was off the air at that time <e>", "<cs> no my lords but we had not finally reached our conclusions and thus it was premature to offer a new plan to the bbc while still considering what that plan should be <e> <s> our consideration had to be accelerated when the opposition in another place put down a supply day motion for debate <e> <s> i am the junior minister in the foreign office responsible for the external services and i was informed of the upcoming debate in the other place on the friday and i was in new york at the time <e> <s> the noble lord will not be surprised to know that it was difficult for me to reach an immediate conclusion in conjunction with my colleagues on the new plan until my return from the usa <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not the correct interpretation of our actions <e> <s> as my right honourable friend the then-chancellor of the duchy of lancaster said we took into consideration the views of both houses of parliament <e>", "<cs> there was a vote in another place on th october <e> <s> i have not got the figures <e> <s> the government won easily <e>", "<cs> my noble friend asks what happened on the rd july <e> <s> i have not got those figures <e> <s> i will find out and convey them to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is permissible and the clerk will no doubt gesticulate if i am wrong for noble lords to intervene just as the minister sits down claiming that he has not yet done so <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the guidance of the noble lord on this matter who i think sits on that committee <e> <s> i will therefore sit down <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the noble baroness the precise date for which she asks but i am happy that she is content with the answer that i have given in general terms <e> <s> i did contemplate teasing the noble baroness by dragging out my answer a bit before including the nugget at the end but i think perhaps i was wise not to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords the report which the noble baroness has inquired about in her question relates to the role of consumer councils in respect of the nationalised industries and therefore does not cover all the wide-ranging matters to which the noble lord refers <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have to take their decisions in respect of which services are to be continued the times at which they are to be broadcast and so on in the light of the foreign policy considerations which govern our affairs with the particular countries concerned <e> <s> it was for that reason that we arrived at the decisions that we did about the service for example to the spanish nation to which the noble lord referred just now <e>", "<cs> my lords the foreign policy considerations to which i referred are paramount but that is not to say that the government would not be flexible in considering an arrangement such as the noble lord lord kilmarnock or the noble lord lord hooson have suggested <e> <s> but there are considerable technical difficulties in the way of the proposal which the noble lord now puts forward <e>", "<cs> my lords we are constantly in touch with the bbc on this and related matters but i say again that there are technical difficulties in the way of the proposal which has been advanced <e>", "<cs> my lords that is another question but i went into this matter very fully when we discussed the other day the unstarred question of the noble lord <e> <s> i do not think that t have anything to add to what i said then <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord misunderstood what i said <e> <s> the foreign policy considerations to which i referred lead us to establish a pecking order of priority of these services and it was that reason which persuaded us to conclude that the spanish and italian services could not continue <e>", "<cs> no my lords i did not say that <e>", "<cs> my lords i went into this matter very fully when we discussed the other day the unstarred question and when i answered the questions of the noble lord in considerable detail in respect of the spanish service <e> <s> i do not think that the house would wish me to repeat all that now <e>", "<cs> my lords i am greatly obliged to the noble lord lord davies of leek for his general reception to these two orders <e> <s> i shall simply take the points that he raised with me <e> <s> i understand that there are international organisations which enjoy these privileges in london at the present time <e> <s> that excludes the commonwealth secretariat which is perhaps not quite in the same class <e> <s> there are high officers as they are called of those organisations who enjoy certain personal privileges with regard to their official acts and other officers <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords it is unhappily the case that relations between the united kingdom and libya have not always been smooth <e> <s> as recently as may and june of last year her majestys government were obliged to take certain steps with regard to a number of libyan diplomats in london <e> <s> this was made necessary because the activities of the gentlemen concerned were incompatible with their status as diplo <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that that was a possible interpretation of some of the items in the programme and of course i equally reject it on that basis <e> <s> i want to turn now to some of the other points made during the course of discussions this evening <e> <s> first my noble friend lord salisbury asked in particular about the crimes that took place in this country in the early part of <e> <s> i earlier reminded your lordships of the statements i made in may and june about the action that the government took at that time but your lordships may recall that since then three people have been convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment for these crimes <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a specific matter for the midland bank and i suggest that inquiries should be addressed to them <e> <s> the government have no particular control over the midland bank or any other bank <e>", "<cs> my lords naturally we do think that the expenditure is justified otherwise we should not have agreed to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to begin with an apology to your lordships in that very important business in connection with our presidency of the european council made it necessary for me to be absent from the chamber for a short while during the course of this debate <e> <s> thus i missed although i have had it reported to me the speech of the noble viscount lord simon and also i am ashamed to say the maiden speech of the right reverend prelate the bishop of hereford <e> <s> i was in fact in the chamber for the right reverend prelates closing remarks but in accordance with practice i did not take my seat on the bench here as that would have been regarded quite properly as impertinent <e> <s> however i did hear the right reverend prelates closing remarks and i want to congratulate him on them at least and to express the hope that he will intervene again soon and often in your <e>", "<cs> i can assure the noble lord that the government are very much aware of the urgency that attaches to these considerations my lords and i shall see that there is no undue delay in the consideration of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether the western countries have kept their cards quite so close to their chest as my noble friend suggests <e> <s> i wonder whether my noble friend has seen the report on the hearings of the select committee on intelligence of the house of representatives which was published last year <e> <s> if he turns to page of that report i shall be happy to direct him later to the publication he will see that considerable detail was produced by the cia <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not wish to suggest that every branch of the european peace movement is funded by the soviet union or other eastern <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the case to which my noble friend refers and i can assure him that we shall keep ourselves properly informed <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not think that that is a proper inference <e> <s> certainly i am prepared to point to the support which the world peace council receives but to go wider and to suggest that they all receive such support is going too far <e>", "<cs> my lords i would certainly want to study more carefully what the french minister said before giving a categorical assurance of the kind for which the noble lord has asked but i do not think i would want to support a proposal which amounted to a witch hunt <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not want to draw too close a comparison between the peace movements of eastern europe which in my view are far from spontaneous and others in western europe which are more so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that that is the intention of the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not seen a trans-script of what dr luns said in the broadcast to which my noble friend has referred but i suggest it is unwise to take such a remark out of context as my noble friend has done <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord jenkins of putney is of course a well-known member of the unilateral disarmament movement in this country <e> <s> i think he tends to attach too much levity to the matter raised by my noble friend <e> <s> it is an important matter and as i have said there is certainly some evidence of soviet support for some of the unilateral disarmament movements <e> <s> i would not accept the levity which the noble lord opposite attaches to the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no question of illegality with the present proposal which has not come into force yet <e> <s> as i said at the end of my first answer the civil aviation authority has invited british airways to file the new fares which doubtless they will do <e>", "<cs> my lords i have on many occasions explained to your lordships the legal complexities of this matter including the need to carry other governments with us in the necessary negotiations <e> <s> as i said the civil aviation authority has invited british airways to file new fares and i see no reason why the process should not be completed by the time the new arrangements come into force <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not necessary to alter the legislation by th december or indeed by st january when the proposals are to come into effect provided the processes of the civil aviation authority approval and subsequent government approval if that proves to be necessary can be achieved by that time <e> <s> i have no reason to think that they cannot <e>", "<cs> my lords british airways apparently take the view that on the routes on question the amount of discounting that is going on by other airlines is such that they have to compete in this perfectly proper way <e> <s> what the reaction of the other airlines will be to british airways move is not for me to suggest <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not responsible for decisions taken at labour party or liberal party conferences but in fact the british atlantic committee covers a very wide spectrum of british political opinion including members of the party sitting opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure it is for me to intervene in the discussions which go on and exchange of views which takes place between the labour party and the liberal party <e> <s> so far as i am able to detect them liberal party policies in this matter seem acceptable <e>", "<cs> as i said earlier my lords the fact is that this organisation has no particular political affiliations and enjoys the support of representatives of all the major political parties in this country <e>", "<cs> of course my lords the question of financial support is a wider philosophical one but it is perhaps worth mentioning that i think the opposition party itself now enjoys some support from central government <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not the purpose of this organisation to campaign for or against any other body with political affiliations but in certain cases to correct certain misrepresentations <e>", "<cs> my lords there is nothing in the constitution of this body which would preclude it from campaigning against the government as the noble lord puts it if thought fit to do so but of course it prefers to act on the merits of the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords after the industrial dispute in the civil service earlier this year the backlog of trade statistics work at customs statistical office was equivalent to some six months output <e> <s> it is not possible to provide current trade figures and to recover the backlog within a reasonable time without a reduction in the overall workload <e> <s> for this reason and after careful consideration of users needs it has been decided to produce the export statistics for the nine months of march to august on the basis of a sample <e>", "<cs> my lords i assure my noble friend that my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer who is responsible for these matters considered this matter very fully indeed and did so on more than one occasion and came to the conclusion to which i have referred <e> <s> i agree that this presents some difficulties for exporters in particular but i think that the difficulties that would have been created by following some other course would have been even greater <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that if it were possible it would be highly desirable to produce the figures to which my noble friend and the noble lord have referred but there are two difficulties <e> <s> it was a question not only of providing adequate resources for the task but also of practicality <e> <s> for example it was suggested that the extra work might be done by using outside computer bureaux or computer agencies but that proved to be impracticable because of the need to preserve confidentiality <e> <s> added to that there is the difficulty of providing the necessary additional skilled personnel to undertake the necessary computer inputs <e>", "<cs> my lords the need for confidentiality arises in transferring the figures from the pieces of paper on which they originate to the depersonalised information which eventually appears in the published statistics <e> <s> it is necessary to remove the name of the individual exporter from documents relating to a particular transaction for example and that is the confidentiality element to which i referred <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the case that some of the import statistics are being produced slightly more comprehensively than are the export statistics but the answer remains the same that it is not possible to provide the additional service to which my noble friend referred because of the difficulties that i have described <e>", "<cs> my lords i have great sympathy with the noble lord in regard to that supplementary question and i shall do my best not to use the word again <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend that my right honourable friend the chancellor has looked at this matter with the greatest care and indeed the greatest sympathy <e> <s> as my noble friend will know my right honourable friend has received a number of representations on this subject not least from the organisation of which my noble friend is a senior official but my right honourable friend nonetheless came to the view that despite the difficulties it was not possible to proceed in the way that some people were asking because of the problems that i have described <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be very happy to try to do that in a moment <e> <s> in the meantime can the noble baroness explain what she defines as user charges in this context <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful that this debate has not been too strictly confined within the terms of the bill before us for it has thus allowed the government in particular myself an opportunity to hear and note the views of your lordships on a wide range of topics of interest within the civil aviation sector generally as well as specific points about british airways and the british airports authority <e> <s> i shall endeavour to deal with as many points as i can <e> <s> if time prevents me from dealing with all of them i shall certainly undertake to write to those noble lords whose points i have not been able to cover with as full an explanation as i can manage <e>", "<cs> i listened carefully to what the noble baroness said tonight my lords as i always do <e> <s> she is aware that the inquiry is proceeding at present and i do not think it would be right for me to go into greater detail than i have because of the nature of the inquiry of which she is well aware but i shall return shortly to the other points the noble baroness made <e> <s> to revert to the speech of the noble earl lord amherst who referred also to the question of the perry oak site which might be a site for a fifth terminal at heathrow that is of course covered at the stansted inquiry and if there is merit in that proposal doubtless it will come forward in the report which the inspector will prepare <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall have to consider that in due time but speaking specifically about the core budget of the food and agriculture organisation which was the principal matter under consideration at the conference the united kingdom will be contributing per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is certainly right about that <e> <s> matters might also be helped if the soviet union would contribute to and participate in the affairs of the food and agriculture organisation <e>", "<cs> my lords each bilateral programme has to be considered on its merits <e> <s> there were a very great many industrial implications including benefits to the indian community itself with regard to the project to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> it is however the case that we should prefer to contain the growth of our contributions to multilateral agencies like the food and agriculture organisation so that the important contributions that we make to bilateral programmes can be maintained <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly share the views of my noble friend in that direction <e> <s> the provision of agricultural expertise as my noble friend described it is a very important part of our bilateral aid programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not seen the japanese publication to which the noble lord refers but from the sound of it i agree with it <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that the original concepts which led to the foundation of the food and agriculture organisation and the very distinguished initial leadership of the late lord boyd-orr are much to be admired <e> <s> but we have considerable <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to agree that some of our aid to some of the multilateral agencies working in this field is sometimes less effective than we would wish <e> <s> thus it is that we seek to direct our bilateral aid programme to the poorest countries in particular because clearly they are those in the greatest need <e>", "<cs> my lords i can say for example that of the contributions to the world food programme to which i referred in my earlier answer the united kingdom will be contributing bilaterally tonnes of cereal while the european community itself will be providing a further tonnes <e>", "<cs> my lords as the advisory committee on airports policy made clear in its report its assessment of the surface access requirement of the <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend as i fear he has done in connection with this matter on earlier occasions has over-simplified the problems to which he refers <e> <s> the problems of access to the severnside airport are quite considerable including the one referred to in his question and my answer <e> <s> as for the source of the evidence to which he has referred as i believe i have made clear already the evidence was to be found in the views of the members of the study group <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has raised an interesting point <e> <s> i believe that if the airport were in existence now it would have suffered very considerably from the recent flooding in that part of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the airlines had better be warned to fit floats <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that some of the suggestions trailed in the noble lords question have been the subject of press releases i think by the commission but it is too early yet to give a detailed response to these <e> <s> we shall certainly be ready to do so as soon as the report appears and we have had a chance to study it <e> <s> i understand that that will be in time for <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly be very willing to answer appropriate questions on this matter which your lordships may see fit to table <e> <s> if the noble lord is referring to the talks which i think are taking place today in geneva between mr gromyko and mr haig then we are certainly watching those with great interest <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just make two points about our attitude to arms sales in general <e> <s> the first one is that we would not seek to restrict the ability of other governments be they third world or any other to acquire such arms as they may properly require for their defence <e> <s> we naturally take a strong view about arms being sold for what the noble lord has referred to as repressive purposes from time to time <e> <s> as the noble lord and the house will recall we do license each and every sale of arms of this kind and indeed any other kind and so they cannot be regarded in the same light as commercial sales of other categories <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> it may be for the convenience of the committee if i quite out of order i think intervened at this moment to say that there has been a slight change of plan and i understand that my noble friend lord kinnoull would now wish to have his amendment considered <e>", "<cs> my lords we have heard a number of critical comments this evening and indeed on other occasions about the arrangements for financing the british airport authoritys capital expenditure and allegations have beenmade that certain changes would enable the authority to reduce its charges <e> <s> i think that that is the burden of what the noble lord lord ponsonby was saying <e> <s> before i respond to the specific points which he my noble friend and indeed the noble baroness raised perhaps i should make a couple of general observations <e>", "<cs> my lords i was about to explain to my noble friend why the decline took place <e> <s> as i said it was not due to prices though operators may claim that <e> <s> the truth is that longer-range helicopters came into service which meant that the traffic which in any event originates other than at sunburgh can now proceed to most of the oil rigs and production platforms in the north sea direct without making a stop at sunburgh <e> <s> so whereas originally the helicopters operated from sunburgh to the rigs and sunburgh itself was served by fixed-wing aircraft it is now possible for the helicopters to proceed direct from aberdeen for example and not land at sunburgh <e> <s> it is certainly the case that the facilities that gave rise to the level of charges to which my noble friend has drawn attention were specially installed for the benefit of the oil-related traffic and thus in our view it was right that that traffic should in general bear the cost of providing those facilities <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i am not up to date on the latest position as to that but i will certainly ascertain what the position is and write to my noble friend <e> <s> however perhaps i could just say that the borrowing powers being conferred on british airways by this clause are of course for the purposes of their current capital expenditure programme <e>", "<cs> my lords the americans have made it clear that they intend to persevere and pursue these negotiations but the noble lord is right to say that the events in poland sour the atmosphere <e>", "<cs> my lords this government certainly hope that these negotiations can proceed at an appropriate time <e> <s> indeed i think we had all hoped that the date for the re-start of these negotiations would have emerged from the haig-gromyko talks <e>", "<cs> my lords we have become used to wringing declarations from the soviet camp about their peaceful intentions <e> <s> what we now have to do is see them match their actions to those fine words <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness is referring to the panorama programme a week or so ago <e>", "<cs> then that programme made it clear that there is no present intention to base those gases in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that my noble friend lord trenchard will hasten to come to the house to answer appropriate questions when they appear on the order paper <e> <s> it is of course the case that when we came to office a year or so ago there were a number of deficiencies in our front line forces which we have been putting right ever since <e>", "<cs> my lords the present talks if the noble lord is referring to those which appear in the question are of course specifically aimed at intermediate-range land-based systems <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been decided that the details of the talks should remain confidential <e> <s> i venture to suggest that if they were to be conducted in the full spotlight of international publicity progress would be much more difficult <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so the noble lord lord brockway misunderstands the implications of the situation in poland <e> <s> the fact is that we are now asked to conduct negotiations in various disarmament and other fora with the eastern <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend puts his finger on the nub of the problem <e> <s> it is indeed the case that the soviet union already has a substantial superiority in these intermediate-range weapons and that is why it is so important for the talks at geneva to proceed and i hope succeed <e>", "<cs> my lords despite repeated discussions by ministers in the finance council and a great deal of pressure at all levels agreement on the insurance services directive still appears to be some way off <e> <s> the intensive work under our presidency has achieved agreement on some issues and has clarified many of the areas of disagreement <e> <s> but there remain fundamental differences of view between the united kingdom and several other member states not all of whom share our objectives <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that i very much share the views of the noble lord in this matter including the acute disappointment that it has not been possible to make more progress on the draft directive which as the noble lord rightly said first came forward from the commission in i think <e> <s> articles and of the treaty of rome impart the basic right of freedom to provide services within the community <e> <s> this country has conceded willingly the right in connection with the supply of goods within the community sometimes at considerable disadvantage to some of our industries <e> <s> it is time that our service industries were allowed to compete likewise <e>", "<cs> my lords it is of course the case that the belgians have now taken over the presidency <e> <s> we understand that they intend to keep up work on the directive although it may be too much to expect them to do so at the pace which we set during our presidency <e> <s> but we are very happy that they intend to keep up some pressure at least on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that we pressed this matter with the utmost <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i know that is not the case i must say <e> <s> the directive is related to the conduct of commercial-type insurance business in the community for example large companies insuring their premises and that sort of thing <e> <s> it does not relate to the investment of funds nor does it relate incidentally to consumer-type insurance such as for example motor insurance or private house insurance <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i would <e>", "<cs> my lords as the question reminds us this unfortunate man has been in prison for more than years <e> <s> i understand although it is a long time ago that he was in fact convicted of some alleged offence at the time <e> <s> as for proceeding as the noble and learned lord suggests this might be a matter which should be raised at the united nations commission on human rights which resumes this very week <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend may be right about that <e> <s> it was more than years ago and i confess that when i inquired about this earlier today it was not possible for me to be precisely informed <e>", "<cs> my lords first let me say to the noble lord lord bruce of donnigton in thanking him for his acceptance of the statement that this matter is a very complicated one legally <e> <s> as i understand it in essence and i confess that i come as something of a novice in these matters the budget is proposed by the council and may then be rejected <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord says it is of course the case that the proceedings before the european court are likely to take a very long time <e> <s> i would not want to put a figure on it in terms of months or years but certainly it will be a long time <e> <s> the figure of million per month equals if my mental arithmetic is right million a year but of course each of the payments will have to be authorised by an appropriate estimate approved by the other place <e> <s> however i want to say that the government very much hope that the matter can be resolved by discussion between the institutions before it comes to the european court and in which case of course the financial implications would be much less important <e>", "<cs> my lords may i deal with the first point raised by the noble lord <e> <s> as regards the matter on which the court will be asked to adjudicate in due course if that is what happens because as i said we hope that it can be resolved by negotiation before then it will not adjudicate on the merits of the proposals within the budget but upon the legality of them <e> <s> the question that the court will be asked to decide is whether the parliament is empowered under the treaty of rome to make the increase in the budget provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of any problem in connection with the distribution of documents through the printed paper office <e> <s> if there is any difficulty i shall certainly look into it <e> <s> as for the difference between the detail put forward by the commission and the detail put forward by successive governments in respect of budgetary and other considerations in another place that is perhaps another issue <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect that is a hypothetical question and i think that it would be a mistake for me to offer a definitive legal view on a rather knotty legal point of that nature <e>", "<cs> my lords it is i think a fairly simple mental arithmetic exercise to arrive at the answer for which the noble lord is looking <e> <s> despite that i am afraid that it is beyond me on my feet at this moment but i shall ascertain the total figure involved and convey it to the noble lord if he will allow me to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i could not give an undertaking of approval of some proposal that is only in the mind of the noble baroness and not in front of my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e> <s> however the attitude of the government towards fares in general particularly on these routes is well known and i doubt whether there would be any difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords with the permission of the house and the noble baroness i will answer next weeks question next week <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there is a danger of over-simplifying these matters <e> <s> for example there are some children i fear whose lives would need a good deal more than that amount if they were to be brought up to an acceptable standard <e> <s> but of course unicef receives funds from sources other than governments <e> <s> for example there is the united kingdom committee for unicef an autonomous body which receives no assistance from public funds <e> <s> it has been steadily increasing its contribution to unicef over recent years and gave in the year <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said there is a danger of oversimplifying calculations of this kind <e> <s> the figure does not itself appear in the report to which the noble lord lord brockway referred but is derived from certain other figures appearing in that document <e>", "<cs> my lords we are of course in constant touch with the united nations high commissioner for refugees and we help him as best we can in the light of our limited resources and in the light of his needs <e> <s> but unicef to which the question on the order paper relates does indeed have a programme in el salvador and doubtless that is of some benefit there <e>", "<cs> naturally my lords i welcome those activities <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall certainly give consideration to any appeal that comes to our notice <e> <s> but i would again draw the noble lords attention to the united kingdom committee for unicef which is already active in this area <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that as my noble friend lord belstead informed the noble lord in a written answer on st february the delay at bombay is currently about eight months <e> <s> this long delay has been caused because the post have had a backlog of statements which they arc slowly clearing <e> <s> they expect to fall into line with other posts by the second half of <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree of course that the preparation of the statement which is the subject of the question is not the end of the matter in regard to these appeals <e> <s> however in january the number of entry clearance officers in bombay was increased <e> <s> at that time bombay did have a considerable backlog of paper work <e> <s> i am happy to say that that has been somewhat reduced now and i hope it will be eliminated later this year <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord i am anxious about the delays that there are in some of these cases <e> <s> as the noble lord lord avebury knows we have in certain areas been able to introduce a modest <e>", "<cs> my lords if we can consider the case of elderly parents who are a particularly important area of dependants who apply through bombay and some of the other posts in the subcontinent i understand that such persons applied as aged dependent parents in <e> <s> of these entry clearances were issued to applications were refused and were either referred to the home office or deferred locally for further inquiries <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a very considerable amount of work necessary in the preparation of these appeal statements <e> <s> the answer to the noble lord is therefore yes that was the time taken <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not just a question of determining whether or not an aged parent is dependent on the person in the united kingdom <e> <s> there are matters of identity for example which may have to be established and sometimes these things are very difficult <e>", "<cs> my lords as a matter of fact these matters fall to me as the responsible minister because the entry clearance arrangements in the sub-continent are handled by the foreign office and it also happens that i am intending to visit the sub-continent in the near future to look into these arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary of state for trade made a statement in another place last friday about the events which have overtaken laker airways <e> <s> since then i understand that one financial institution have been exploring ways of raising additional finance to save the airline <e> <s> the receiver has made clear that if they succeed in doing so they will need the concurrence of the other major creditors who have loaned money to laker airways <e> <s> strenuous efforts were made by the banks in recent months to find ways of marshalling additional financial support and i cannot be optimistic that this effort will succeed <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is certainly right when he suggests as i think is the main gist of his question that things will never be the same again in international air transport even though laker himself may or may not be part of them <e> <s> the fact is that laker gave birth to a new era in international air transport and will certainly always be remembered for that if nothing more <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said to my noble friend lord balfour things will never be the same again in international air transport <e> <s> i am thinking particularly of the competitive arrangements that exist in some markets <e> <s> it is certainly the case that the british government find themselves at variance with some overseas governments with regard to fare levels and other conditions which attach to air services around the world <e> <s> but having said that we are of course obliged to operate in the existing international environment <e> <s> we are doing our best to change that environment not least in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the civil aviation authority have given notice of their intention to suspend and in due course if need be to revoke the air transport licences held by laker airways <e> <s> that is a necessary concomitant to what has happened because of course the caa have to have regard to their duty as laid down in civil aviation legislation which is to ensure in general terms that the operators are in a fit state to discharge the obligations of their licences <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite certain what aspect of policy the noble lord thinks we ought to review <e> <s> the general policy towards air transport as with other industries is that they should be allowed to compete fairly and squarely with all the other international companies in the business <e> <s> that is in fact our main bone of contention at present and i fancy the main bone of contention of lady burton of coventry as well that british airlines are not allowed to compete on all fours with other airlines in the world market <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had many debates lately on a number of different aspects of civil aviation policy <e> <s> it is of course the case that the british independent air transport industry as a whole actually made a profit last year albeit a small one and so i do not think that we need to have any fears or cause for concern for the long-term future of the british independent air transport industry <e> <s> as for the nationalised side of the air transport industry our policy remains as i have reported to your lordships on a number of occasions that british airways itself should be privatised as soon as is practicable <e>", "<cs> my lords the policy of her majestys government with regard to the british independent air transport industry is of course that it should stand on its own feet and flourish or otherwise as its own management determines <e> <s> it is unhappily the case that as a result of various factors some of which i think were outside sir freddies control but perhaps not all of them laker airways has found itself in difficulties <e> <s> a number of things are going on as the question indicates and it is too early to say yet that laker airways is finally finished <e> <s> i must say that i hope that it is not but it is not the governments policy to stand behind laker airways or indeed any other commercial company of this nature in these circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i would agree with the noble lord <e> <s> i think that the difficulties which have caused laker airways to come to this sorry pass as indeed it is may to some extent be a result of misguided decisions within the management of laker airways and may to some other extent be as a result for example of fluctuations in the currency rate which laker himself has referred to <e> <s> but i think that a profound reinvestigation of the british civil aviation industry is not appropriate in this context <e> <s> as i said earlier the independent sector of british civil aviation taken as a whole actually made a small profit last year and i think that there is no reason for any long-term worry about the future <e>", "<cs> my lords the difficulty is that once he gets government support he ceases to be an independent airline and that is the view which i think sir freddie himself takes it is certainly the view that the government take <e> <s> the public have been very forthcoming just lately in the various undertakings that have been given and i have heard of figures of million or so that various people have undertaken to put in <e> <s> but i have to say that in the context of the figures as i understand them with regard to laker airways million is nowhere near enough <e>", "<cs> my lords the money to which i referred has i think been contributed to private funds <e>", "<cs> my lords laker of course was a fairly doughty opponent of the international cartel arrangements to which my noble friend refers and had indeed achieved a very considerable measure of success in being allowed to operate free from the restrictions of that cartel witness the obvious fact of his skytrain service across the north atlantic which was of course operated outside the confines of iata and indeed the other scheduled services which he had in mind would likewise have been operated outside the confines of iata <e> <s> iata of course is not a government body as people often seem to think it is in fact an association of airlines and the governments views on that matter have been frequently expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that it can if the circumstances merit it i do not think that they do on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords it is an extraordinary thing that the debates which follow reports of the noble lord lord plowden very often introduced by the noble lord himself bring forward a fine array of maiden speakers <e> <s> i recall that some years ago the nobel lord headed a committee which inquired into the future of the british aircraft industry and i recall that i made my maiden speech in your lordships house upon that debate <e> <s> today we continue the tradition with the maiden speeches of my noble friend lord airlie and the noble viscount lord chandos <e>", "<cs> my lords nobody doubts the horrors which would follow from a nuclear exchange <e> <s> that is why our policy seeks to prevent that <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is suggesting that we in this country should disarm unilaterally i have to tell him that that would make war more not less likely <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the case that for example the united states recently put forward the proposal for the zero option which is being pressed now in the inf talks as they are called in geneva <e> <s> the british government wholly support that initiative <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that the mission has yet been received by the soviet government <e> <s> i have no information on that point but i have no doubt that they will be <e>", "<cs> my lords the proposals that come forward from time to time have to be examined in the context of whether they are balanced and verifiable <e> <s> when such proposals come forward we shall hasten to support them <e> <s> when they are not of that kind then we shall not <e>", "<cs> my lords his holiness the pope and the right reverend primate the archbishop are of course very sensible people and that is why they adopt the views they do <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware to which particular proposals the noble lord is referring but they doubtless fail to meet some other essential criteria <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to your lordships for the response to this order <e> <s> the principle of the matter which we are discussing was as the noble baroness pointed out discussed at very considerable length and this legislation recently went through parliament at the hands in this house at least of the noble lord lord oram and i am happy to see him in his place this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not taking up that point <e> <s> the charge is covered by the airlines differently according to the nature of the flight concerned <e> <s> on charter flights i understand that the normal practice is to put the charge directly on to the invoice as an identifiable extra but in terms of scheduled service tickets the charge is not separately identified in the fare which the passenger pays <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness will contain herself i am just coming to that point <e> <s> the charge as far as charter tickets is concerned is separately charged to the customer on the invoice and i presume relates precisely to the charge as it is imposed on the airline <e> <s> i have not heard that the charges are something higher than the figure provided for in the regulations <e> <s> as far as the scheduled services are concerned i imagine that in the short term the reduction will benefit the airlines because i do not expect air fares to be suddenly reduced by pence from the st march <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect that is a question which ought to be addressed to the airlines and not to me <e>", "<cs> certainly my lords it is not the governments intention that this fund should generate the substantial surplus that it has done in recent years and months <e> <s> if that situation looked like arising again later in the year we would want to look again at the charge <e> <s> as for the date on which any changes will be announced so that the travel organisations for example can have prior notice i take note of the importance of the point which the noble lord raises <e> <s> there are difficulties in setting it too far ahead because costs increase and it is not always possible to know precisely how those costs will increase how numbers of passengers will fluctuate and other related matters <e> <s> i take note of the point that any increase ought to he announced as far in advance as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords the studies that preceded our signature of this convention were intended only to establish as quickly as possible that there was sufficient probability of our being able to ratify the convention for us to be justified in signing <e> <s> ratification on the other hand involves entering into precise legal obligations and we need to compare the convention in great detail with our existing law and practice <e> <s> before signature the dependent territories were only asked whether they objected to us signing <e> <s> they must now carry out their own detailed comparison of the text of their laws <e> <s> as to whether i am surprised at the attitude of my noble friend the answer is no <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i would accept that we have been dragging our feet on this matter <e> <s> the signature took place only in july last year and the processes of consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords when your lordships house is reformed so that bishops answer from this box that will be a suitable occasion for that question <e>", "<cs> my lords that is indeed one of the matters which has to be considered <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter which no doubt will be exercising my noble friend lady trumpington <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i would want to be drawn down that particular path at this juncture <e> <s> i would repeat in all seriousness that this is a very complicated matter there are a number of very detailed and complex implications for our own laws and also as it happens for the law of scotland which is not in every respect the same as ours <e> <s> but we will certainly proceed as quickly as we properly can <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that my noble friend wishes this matter to proceed more <e>", "<cs> my lords i am reminded of the dictum of oscar wilde that there is only one thing worse than bad publicity and that is no publicity <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord carrington i beg to introduce a bill to implement the international convention against the taking of hostages and for connected purposes <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to start first by echoing the thanks to the noble lord for raising this matter <e> <s> but i also want to emphasise that her majestys government are indeed fully aware of the problems which the bahi community in iran faces and we are deeply concerned about reports of recent developments there which suggest a more widespread persecution of that community <e> <s> we are doing what we can to bring home to the iranian authorities our concern at the state of affaris <e> <s> we do not wish to interfere in the internal affairs of iran but we cannot remain silent when the elementary human rights of a small community are abused <e>", "<cs> no my lords no reply has yet been received <e> <s> it was delivered only on st january and i think such a reply would not in any event be expected by this time <e> <s> the united nations commission on human rights is currently in session in geveva and indeed the united kingdom mission to that organisation is led by my noble friend lord colville of culross <e> <s> our commissioners are considering with our partners what action to take which would be in the best interest of the bahis in iran <e> <s> we shall certainly take every opportunity in the future to press home to the iranian government our concern about the situation of the bahis in that country <e>", "<cs> my lords i remember that when i was first appointed to be a member of this administration somebody said to me that i would have to learn to say nothing in a thousand different ways <e> <s> i fancy that i have exhausted most of them now on the noble baroness <e> <s> on the specific question put by the noble baroness it is for british airways to make an application to extend the scope of the experiment and the caa will certainly be happy to consider applications when they come forward <e> <s> it is worth recalling that the particular application which gave rise to the present experiment was agreed in hours <e>", "<cs> my lords it depends whether the applications come from other british airlines or from other foreign airlines <e> <s> other british airlines must apply to the civil aviation authority whereas foreign airlines must apply through the governmental machinery <e> <s> my reply to any application of that nature will be the same as it was last time <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is asking me to predict the outcome of applications to the civil aviation authority <e> <s> i regret that i cannot do that <e>", "<cs> my lords anybody who has listened to the exchanges on these matters in your lordships house in recent weeks would i think hardly have arrived at that conclusion <e> <s> certainly we accept the importance of disarmament matters and indeed we accept the importance of the dissemination of disarmament information on a wide scale as i implied in the last sentence of my main answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that i do not think it will have the slightest effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the campaign to which the noble lord refers which i think i am right in saying is led by the noble lord lord brockway and the noble lord lord noel-baker <e> <s> but i do not think that that campaign is a unilateral campaign which i believe is the preferred course of the noble lord lord jenkins of putney <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of the discussions to which the noble lord refers but of course her majestys government have constantly supported proposals which would lead to balanced and verifiable measures of disarmament in whatever fora <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the shortcomings of the various disarmament moves which took place prior to the second world war were shortcomings which we seek to avoid now and so far as i am aware of them and i confess that it was long before my time those shortcomings were that they were neither balanced nor verifiable <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is of course right when he implies as he does that we have to take the soviet unions actions into account and not their words <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there is a very distinct difference between unilateral disarmament and multilateral disarmament <e> <s> this government support measures of balanced and verifiable multilateral disarmament <e> <s> we do not support the approach which the noble lord lord jenkins of putney with all sincerity advances that we should disarm unilaterally <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i am not able to give the house a date when those talks will recommence <e> <s> that of course is a matter for the soviet union and the united states to decide between themselves <e> <s> the united kingdom is not directly involved in those talks as the noble lord will know <e> <s> but i hope that it will be before too long <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no need to convert my noble friends to genuine multilateral disarmament because they already believe in it <e> <s> as to the assertion that the noble lord adheres to both schools of thought i am afraid that that puzzles me all the more <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will not be surprised if i tell him that we prefer the plan to which we ourselves subscribed which lays down or suggests a more step-by-step approach to comprehensive disarmament than the one proposed by the group of to which the noble lord also referred <e> <s> it is perhaps worth repeating that the government view a view to which successive british governments have subscribed is that a comprehensive total all-embracing plan for world disarmament is perhaps unduly optimistic in the present climate of international affairs generally and a more step-by-step approach by which we try to solve the problems one by one is more likely to achieve success in the long run <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will know there is a working party concerned with the use of chemical weapons under the auspices of the committee on disarmament in geneva and we have indeed made important contributions to the working of that particular discussion group <e> <s> we certainly share the general world abhorrence towards these weapons but we have to have regard to the fact that some of our potential opponents possess these weapons and we must organise our affairs accordingly <e>", "<cs> my lords the position is that we hope that the start talks as they are now called the noble lord will know that they have been rechristened in recent months and i think rightly so are likely to recommence during the course of the next few months but a date has not yet been set <e>", "<cs> my lords the british government will certainly always be willing to listen to proposals which are designed to lead to a consensus view on these matters but in the end we have to have regard to the necessary fact that we must not allow our position to be degraded in terms of world security generally <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not quite hear the last part of the noble lords supplementary but the government will certainly continue to seek progress on test ban issues <e> <s> the americans have said that the trilateral comprehensive test ban negotiations are unlikely to resume <e> <s> the government understand the reasons for the united states decision but we shall certainly continue to seek ways of moving things forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly convey to my noble friend the kind words of the noble lord <e> <s> as to the first part of this supplementary we certainly support and encourage the polish people in their wish to exercise their undoubted right to self-determination <e>", "<cs> the question of a debate is one for the usual channels my lords who i understand are in touch on this matter <e> <s> as to the first part of the noble lords supplementary i have given up predicting what is going to happen in poland <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that it is important that the humanitarian aid which we are providing through the european community should reach the right people <e> <s> we believe that on the whole it is and we have received a number of assurances to that effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether general jaruzelski reads the <e>", "<cs> i have not yet had a chance to read the article to which the noble lord refers my lords but i shall certainly do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure how the noble lord thinks we are going to end up at war in this matter but our general views about the situation have been made well known <e>", "<cs> my lords the polish government have said they want to resume the dialogue with the trade union solidarity and we look forward to the day when they will do that <e>", "<cs> my lords the agreement establishing the confederation of senegambia states clearly that each country is to maintain its independence and sovereignty <e> <s> president jawara has said that the confederation will not compromise any of the agreements which link the gambia to great britain and the rest of the commonwealth <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend may know the decisions of the international monetary fund are generally arrived at by a consensus of the board members of the fund and i would not therefore want to quarrel with the decisions that they have reached <e> <s> doubtless they had good reasons to decide as they did <e> <s> but i certainly confirm that as my noble friend said on th november we are strong supporters of the stability of that region <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the arrangement which is the subject of the question in any way affects the organisation to which the noble lord refers <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said the decisions of the international monetary fund are generally arrived at by means of a consensus of the board members and of course we play our part in achieving that consensus <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that what i am being asked to do is to short-circuit the proper procedures of the imf of which of course france is also a member <e> <s> if the noble lord is thinking on the other hand of some assistance through our aid programme of course we do what we can in those countries as well within the limits of our resources <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with him bar one <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will know the united kingdom has abstained on the united nations resolutions relating to east timor since along with most of our european community colleagues in fact all of them except greece <e> <s> but on this particular occasion my noble friend drew the attention of the indonesian foreign minister to the public concern felt in this country over persisting reports of deaths disappearances and indeed want in east timor <e> <s> dr mochtar suggested that those concerned about persons reported to have disappeared for example should get in touch with the international committee of the red cross which has full access and which operates a tracing service for missing persons <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier my noble friend had wide-ranging discussions about various matters with his indonesian counterparts but i was particularly asked about the position in east timor and my noble friend used the words that i have described <e>", "<cs> my lords the investigation to which the noble lord has referred had i think been going on for quite a long time and the noble lord will recall that we had i believe an unstarred question on this matter a year or so ago <e> <s> i have not much to add to what i said on that occasion except to tell your lordships about the most recent representations which my noble friend made when he was recently in jakarta <e>", "<cs> my lords in recent weeks attention has concentrated on the continuing efforts of certain arab governments to agree on a common negotiating stance and on the forthcoming israeli withdrawal from sinai in accordance with the egypt-israeli peace treaty <e> <s> we believe that steps towards a comprehensive settlement in the middle east must include both recognition of the palestinian right to self-determination and recognition of israels right to live in peace <e> <s> we and our european partners remain actively involved in the search for progress to this end on the basis of the venice declaration <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that to suggest that a conference now on the lines suggested by the noble lord would make real or early progress is perhaps to underestimate the complexity of the situation in the middle east <e> <s> such a conference if it ever came about would have to be very well prepared and would need a substantial shift in the position of a number of would-be participants before it stood a chance of success <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not deny that the position in and around southern lebanon is one that causes some anxiety but i would hope that all the potential participants in any unfortunate affair which may take place in that part of the world will exercise the greatest discretion in the present circumstances <e> <s> i have not seen the article in <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have often said in your lordships house it is a mistake to imagine that any worthwhile progress in the middle east can be achieved without taking into account the views of the palestinian people <e> <s> i would not suggest that the plo are the sole representatives of the palestinian people because they are not but they do represent an important segment of palestinian opinion <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is too early to draw conclusions from the meeting in delhi to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> i think that meeting was taking place yesterday and today and naturally i have not yet had any reports on what has transpired <e> <s> it is strictly a meeting of the group of as they are called and one of the things to which i hope they will apply themselves is a response to the recent american proposals for moving forward the global negotiations <e> <s> but on the more general problem of our aid budget generally we have nothing to be ashamed of in connection with the sums of money that we make available for this purpose <e> <s> in they still exceed million which in our straitened circumstances is a very considerable achievement <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree at all that there is deadlock between north and south as the noble lord suggests <e> <s> many of the nations of the so-called north have substantial aid programmes not least ours to which i have already referred <e> <s> a number of negotiations and discussions in various fora have made significant progress over the years and all in all i think we have nothing of which to be ashamed <e>", "<cs> my lords the problem is not as simple i think as the noble lord would have us believe <e> <s> it was not long ago that the noble lord was referring to for example the recent unicef report which he drew to your lordships attention and which made one or two rather simplistic proposals to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> the problems are not by any means as simple as people would have us believe and i think that the efforts which have been made by most if not all of the members of the so-called north bear close scrutiny <e>", "<cs> my lords all the specialised agencies have their role to play <e> <s> there has been a good deal of discussion recently about the world bank and the imf for example to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> we think it would be a mistake to detract from the expertise which is available within those organisations by for example weighting the voting procedure in some way <e> <s> it is important that the conditions which the imf for example sometimes see fit to attach in fact always see fit to attach to the facilities that they make available are carefully considered <e> <s> although i know there are sometimes moves by some of the third world countries to draw money from the imf for example on less stringent conditions i believe that the conditions they would seek to avoid are sometimes in their own interests <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not the precise figures in front of me in respect of the international development association but it is of course the case that when money is made available through any medium on concessional terms the costs of providing those concessional terms have to fall on somebody <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments views about free trade in the world are well known <e> <s> i agree with the opinion of the noble lord and also with his earlier view that in the long term the future for these third world countries lies in the restoration of prosperity among the remainder of the world <e>", "<cs> i think my lords that probably the truth lies somewhere between the two of those assertions <e> <s> it is true that these countries can and do benefit from transfers of technology but in some cases money is needed to exploit that technology <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> an improvement in the efficiency of agriculture in the third world would go a long way to solving some of their problems <e> <s> for that reason an important part of our aid programme is directed towards that end <e>", "<cs> my lords the government took account of all the relevant factors including environmental considerations in reaching their decision not to pursue the possibility of a second runway at gatwick <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has quoted very selectively from the evidence <e> <s> i would refer her to the sentence before the one that she read out <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we have taken into account the views of the airlines in this matter <e> <s> i was myself at one time an airline operator out of gatwick and am well aware of the operational advantages that might flow from a second runway there <e> <s> i am however persuaded by the arguments that lead <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the commitments to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> indeed i remember discussing that matter in some detail in your lordships house at the time the undertakings were given i think by the british airports authority to the neighbouring authorities <e> <s> the government in fact were not a party to those undertakings but they nonetheless came to the view that a second runway at gatwick would not mean the best use of the funds available <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend was referring to the undertakings given at one time by the british airports authority to the local planning authorities who are responsible for the country surrounding gatwick airport in connection with a second runway <e> <s> as i said the government were not a party to those undertakings but were aware of them <e> <s> it was other matters that drew us to the conclusion that a second runway at gatwick would not be appropriate <e> <s> as to not taking into account the views of people who take a contrary position it seems to me that people get particularly incensed when their view does not prevail but they do not always have right entirely on their side <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an interesting thought but the fact is that a second runway at gatwick to be of any value would have to be constructed as i said about kilometres north of the existing runway and that would mean that the easterly take-off path was right over the centre of the town of <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have to take decisions in these matters as the noble lord well knows in the light of all the arguments advanced <e> <s> certainly there would be some operational advantages to gatwick if a second runway could be made <e> <s> as i said it would need to be made a minimum distance from the existing runway and the cost for example in terms of the environment not to mention money would be very substantial <e> <s> we came to the conclusion which i believe was the right one that the balance of advantage lay in other directions <e>", "<cs> my lords the government take the view that there is a maximum environmental price to be paid at heathrow which should not be exceeded <e> <s> it was for that reason that my right honourable friends when they granted permission for the fourth terminal at heathrow imposed a total maximum number of air transport movements at heathrow of <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no single united kingdom representative to the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe <e> <s> there is a united kingdom delegation consisting of parliamentarians from both houses of parliament who vote in accordance with their own wishes <e>", "<cs> my lords the united kingdoms policy on turkey so far as the council of europe is concerned is that we are in favour of turkey staying in the council of europe <e> <s> a suspension of turkeys relations with the council would not contribute towards the return to democracy <e> <s> i think it is unwise to draw comparisons between the situation in turkey and the situation in poland <e> <s> the armed forces inter <e>", "<cs> my lords the resolution which was passed in the council of europe is a very long and complex one and i must say that it is not very clear in some of its aspects <e> <s> perhaps i will let the noble and learned lord have a copy and he can determine for himself whether he thinks it calls for an inquiry or not <e>", "<cs> my lords it is unhappily the case that there are a number of countries in the world where human rights are not properly observed <e> <s> we make our views known at appropriate moments <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in the original answer the delegates to the council of europe are drawn from all political parties and they do not all vote in the same way <e>", "<cs> my lords we of course reject the charge because we condemn abuses of human rights wherever they may occur <e>", "<cs> my lords we accept the undertakings of the turkish authorities that they intend to return to democracy and of course democracy includes the right of all those who seek to take part in elections to express their views freely during the conduct of those elections and indeed at other times <e> <s> as for the trial to which the noble lord referred as did the noble and learned lord opposite we certainly share concern at the plight of the disk trade union <e> <s> we also have concern for their leaders who are currently being tried and indeed for the of them for whom the death sentence has been requested <e> <s> it does not follow of course that death sentences will be pronounced by the court even if the accused are found guilty but we are nevertheless watching developments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that the answer that i gave was at variance with the question tabled by the noble baroness as she implies <e> <s> the position is as i have described it my honourable friend is considering these matters and will doubtless make a statement in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble baroness the question on the order paper does not refer specifically to how these matters are financed but to how they deal with the airport security levy <e> <s> that is a slightly different matter <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness will know there are a large number of governments with whom we have to consult on these matters <e> <s> i cannot give the noble baroness an undertaking when this will be complete but i can say from my recent and comparatively short experience in the foreign office that consulting other governments is sometimes a very long-winded process <e>", "<cs> my lords the snag is that i cannot quite think how to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords representations were made to the united states administration during the visit to washington of my right honourable friend the prime minister in february <e> <s> a bill has been introduced into the house of representatives which is intended to abolish the requirement for visas for visitors from certain countries including the united kingdom <e> <s> the subject is also under consideration in the senate <e> <s> we are in frequent touch with the united states authorities on this matter <e>", "<cs> certainly my lords there is a good deal of interest in the european community in this <e>", "<cs> my lords i could not answer that question without notice <e> <s> i am not certain anyway whether we would necessarily be aware of representations made between two other governments <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> the bill is designed to enable the united kingdom to ratify the international convention against the taking of hostages <e> <s> it is i believe non-controversial and i hope that it will therefore be welcomed by your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the kind and constructive remarks of support which have been given to the general provisions of this bill <e> <s> perhaps i could deal with just one or two of the points which have been raised during the course of the debate <e> <s> the question was raised by the noble lord lord wigoder and underlined by the noble lord lord bishopston of signature ratification and indeed accession to this convention <e> <s> i hesitate to read out a long list of the countries which have signed ratified or acceded but if <e>", "<cs> my lords i was seeking to take advice on this very point earlier this morning <e> <s> like the previous point raised by the noble lord it proved to be a particularly complex one and perhaps can include a reference to that second question when i write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the house will be grateful to my noble friend lord campbell of croy for enabling us to consider once more the serious and important topic of oil pollution of the sea <e> <s> it is a subject to which your lordships have turned your attention on several occasions in recent years but the documents which are the subject of todays debate provide us with a welcome opportunity to review the position across a broad front <e> <s> before commenting on the main issues raised by the documents and responding to points made in the debate i wish to add my tribute to that of the noble baroness lady white to the late lord ritchie-calder whose death has deprived us of an eminent authoritative and expert spokesman on a great range of issues <e> <s> knowing his keen interest in these matters i feel especially sad that he has been denied the opportunity to participate today <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly want to confirm the importance we attach to the work of the ida <e> <s> that is perhaps indicated by the size of the united kingdoms agreed contribution to ida which is million no less representing just over per cent <e> <s> of the replenishment <e> <s> despite our own economic difficulties we agreed to take this very substantial share in ida which is well above the level which economic grounds alone would justify <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that is correct and that flows from the position of the united states appropriation to which i referred and the precise provisions of the ida replenishment agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords this is in fact a very complicated technical matter <e> <s> but the immediate position is that the united states appropriations which follow from the united states pledging and the appropriations of course have to be approved by the united states congress have fallen short of their original pledged figure although it is worth pointing out that the expenditure under these programmes is likely to extend over years and the pledging and commitment extend over only three years <e> <s> there is therefore a hope that a catching up exercise may be possible in later years <e> <s> in the meantime the international bank for redevelopment ibrd is lending money to cover the shortfall to borrowers of sufficient standing <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord holderness reminded us it is two years since your lordships first debated the report of the brandt commission <e> <s> as the noble earl lord listowel then observed there was unanimity on both sides of the house concerning the gravity of the problems facing the international community and especially the poorest countries <e> <s> there was unanimity too in welcoming the contribution of the brandt commission to the international search for solutions <e> <s> i well remember that debate <e> <s> it was i who replied for the government on that occasion <e> <s> i remember too that the right honourable gentleman the member for bexley sidcup sat upon the steps of the throne during the course of that debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that we could waive the rule if we decided to do so but it would be a very substantial departure from our policy on this matter <e> <s> the ida replenishment agreement is very clear on this point <e> <s> the united states congress as i said earlier have not yet appropriated the full amount which they originally pledged <e> <s> it is possible that they will at some future date <e> <s> the shortfall is to some extent being made up by the ibrd facilities to which i have referred and i do not think that the shortfall of funds which the ida will suffer as a result of this will bear too heavily upon borrowers <e> <s> the other points raised by the noble lord lord cledwyn included a point about the processing of primary products <e> <s> we recognise the wish of developing countries to process their own primary products but sometimes it will make more sense for them to process their products nearer the principal markets for those products <e>", "<cs> no i do not agree with that my lords <e> <s> i have indeed studied the answer which my noble friend lord skelmersdale gave to the noble lord lord hatch of lusby at the end of last year <e> <s> the reasons which my noble friend then gave remain correct <e>", "<cs> my lords the numbers have indeed declined as i described in the original answer and as was referred to at the time of the earlier question at the end of last year <e> <s> but one has to remember that these schemes are operated in the closest consultation with the various governments concerned and they sometimes choose to use the aid funds for other purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government remain gravely concerned about the plight of anatoly shcharansky and are disturbed by recent reports of his ill-treatment <e> <s> we have raised this case with the soviet authorities on many occasions both <e>", "<cs> if i may say so my lords my noble friend has put his finger on the nub of the problem <e> <s> how can we believe what they say in negotiations such as the imf negotiations the mbfr negotiations as they are called in vienna or in any other forum for that matter when they do not do what they said they would do at helsinki in <e>", "<cs> my lords i would certainly be willing to send another message to the soviet union about mr shcharansky if i thought it would have any effect <e> <s> as to the future of mr brezhnev i believe that that is a matter for them to decide for themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords the failure of the soviet agricultural industry is now plain for all to see but i am not sure that the interests of the west are served by starving them out <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not certain that the matter has been raised before that particular body but certainly it has been raised before all the others i mentioned <e> <s> there could be a good opportunity for doing as the noble and learned lord suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords exchanges of this sort are all under review at the present time following first afghanistan and more recently soviet interference in polish affairs <e> <s> i would like to consider these matters in the light of what i think will have the best effect for the person concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly intend to keep up representations to the soviet union on these and related matters <e> <s> as the noble lord rightly points out <e> <s> so far we do not have much to show for our efforts <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to my noble friend his question goes a little wide of what is on the order paper <e> <s> our views on trade sanctions are fairly well known <e> <s> the question of grain sales is principally one for nations other than the united kingdom but we do want to be careful in the immortal words of mr haig not to shoot ourselves in the foot <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to say that i am not certain whether the matter has been so raised or not <e> <s> i will look into the matter to see whether a further move in that direction would be appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that abuses of human rights extend more widely than just the eastern <e>", "<cs> my lords the restoration of general ecgd cover for this market will be dependent upon an improved outlook for the zambian economy upon the progress made in reducing the present arrears of payments guaranteed by ecgd and upon the avoidance of a build up of further arrears <e>", "<cs> my lords the genesis of the problem which now confronts the people of zambia is probably a little more complex than that which the noble lord suggests <e> <s> i have to say that ecgd is not a charity organisation and the payment record of the zambian authorities in recent years and months has been most unsatisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said to the noble lord lord hatch of lusby i do not believe that the problem arises just from the price of copper be it higher or lower than it was in the times to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> one of the other difficulties which the zambians have faced recently for example has been the problem of getting the copper out of zambia and on to the markets <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no doubt that the situation in southern africa as it then was and indeed to some extent as it still is does cause difficulty for some of the nations of the region <e> <s> but as i indicated earlier that is not a reason for granting what can only be regarded as charity through the medium of the ecgd <e>", "<cs> my lords we discussed at some length yesterday the operations of the imf in this and other markets <e> <s> it remains the governments hope that we will in due course be able to restore a credit limit of some sort to the zambian market but it will need an improvement in the present circumstances <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the comparison which the noble lord seeks to draw between poland and southern africa is not in the remotest degree valid <e> <s> what we have done in respect of poland is to indicate by the measures we have taken that business cannot continue as usual with that government or with the government of the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords it is indeed the case that we have substantial commercial relations with south africa <e> <s> as for the drafting of the question and the words used in the question the noble lord lord paget of northampton should address that point to the noble lord lord hatch of lusby <e>", "<cs> my lords i did see the letter in <e>", "<cs> my lords the distinction between poland on the one hand and southern africa on the other hand is as follows <e> <s> first we have not sought to impose trade sanctions on poland <e> <s> the difficulty in which we now find ourselves in regard to our trading arrangements with poland is that the vast amount of credit poland has enjoyed in recent years has imposed serious difficulties on her economy <e> <s> to continue the trading relationship as it was would involve extending a good deal more credit to that economy under circumstances which would not i believe be prudent <e> <s> we have consistently and repeatedly stated our opposition to <e>", "<cs> my lords the delay in preparing the accounts on this occasion was because a fundamental review of the form of the accounts involving ecgd treasury the exchequer and audit department naturally took some time to complete <e> <s> ecgd were involved in considerable work in preparing figures for the new form of accounts and unfortunately much of this preparatory work was delayed by industrial action in the civil service earlier last year <e> <s> it would certainly be the intention to finalise the accounts for at a much earlier date <e>", "<cs> my lords as i recall from the noble lords question last week the position with regard to zambia is that there is no general cover available to zambia but certain cases are considered on their merits and sometimes authorised <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that the reports to which he refers were indeed without foundation <e> <s> the reasons for the delays were precisely those that i described namely the change of the form of the accounting and the industrial difficulties in the civil service last year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord mcnair for his remarks this evening and for the opportunity that he has given for your lordships to discuss this matter and for me to give the government reply <e>", "<cs> priority applicants who applied in this period have either already been interviewed or have been called for interview before the end of april <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we cannot force the administration or rather the rgime in kabul to accept the united nations mission for an investigation on the spot <e> <s> but history tends to suggest that those who refuse in this way have something to hide <e>", "<cs> my lords i too have seen the report to which the noble lord has referred but as i said earlier i can neither confirm nor deny either of the reports that have appeared in the press because our diplomats are not able to visit the spots on the ground <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that an investigation by the united nations would be very helpful in this context <e> <s> the general assembly resolution makes provision for that investigation and in the resolution the secretary-general is invited to report to the next session of the general assembly with the results of his investigation <e> <s> but the fact remains that it will be very difficult for him and his experts to produce a conclusive and definitive report if they are not able to investigate the areas concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that it is not within my gift to prevent these stories appearing in the press and i have to say that many of the press stories in fact have a good deal of circumstantial evidence to support them <e> <s> i agree that there is more than one view as to the accuracy of the reports but as i say there is a good deal of circumstantial evidence to support them <e> <s> i certainly agree with every noble lord who has spoken on this matter that a thorough united nations investigation into the issue is highly desirable and i hope that the soviet authorities who control not only afghanistan but also some other parts of the world notably south-east asia where these allegations have come to light will give access to those areas so that investigations can be made <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that the pressure ought to continue to be applied to the soviets <e> <s> as i said in reply to an earlier supplementary question those who seek to prevent the investigation very likely have something to hide <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that the investigation which the secretary-general has been empowered to mount by the resolution of the general assembly of the united nations will be impartial and i very much hope that it will be successful <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly think that the views of the irc in this matter will be very important <e> <s> i am not certain that they have expressed a view so far but i shall be very willing to hear it if they want to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i would rest my case on the united nations investigation <e> <s> that resolution was carried by an overwhelming majority i understand and i think the world is now waiting to see that the nations at whom the finger has been pointed in this matter fully co-operate with the investigation <e>", "<cs> my lords i would like to begin by congratulating my noble friend lord kinnoull for his enterprise in bringing this bill before your lordships house <e> <s> we have been much reminded recently of the difficulties faced in the present economic climate by the airline industry not least by the independent airlines and this bill is most welcome as a measure to ease pressure on this sector <e> <s> i am glad to be able to say therefore that the government strongly support this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to say that i think that the noble lord is misinformed <e> <s> i have taken great care over this matter and have consulted my honourable friend mr sproat about this <e> <s> this is clearly the position as he recalls it and he was certainly present at the meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the evidence in support of the points that the noble lord has made about patients and about the stockpiling of supplies of the chemicals is very largely circumstantial <e> <s> as the noble lord will recall from what was said yesterday there is going on in this area a united nations initiative which we think offers the best hope of success <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earls supplementary question presupposes that it exists <e>", "<cs> my lords i doubt that the united nations secretary-general needs any prompting from us as to the urgency of this matter <e> <s> in any event under the terms of the united nations resolution he is required to report at the next session of the general assembly <e>", "<cs> my lords there have indeed been some press reports and as i said in the original answer reports from <e>", "<cs> my lords the united kingdom government have on many occasions deplored the presence of cuban troops and for that matter soviet and other advisers in ethiopia but of course the responsibility for these matters lies with the ethiopian government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am inclined to repeat the answer that i gave yesterday to a rather similar question about the use of chemical weapons in another country which was that anyone who prevents or obstructs the united nations in its investigations doubtless has something to hide <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is important for british airways and the various carriers in question to be allowed to conduct these negotiations themselves without any bullying from government but the government certainly hope that the negotiations will succeed and we have every reason to believe that they will <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with the greatest attention to this most interesting not to say historic debate not least to the speeches of our maiden speakers today my noble friend lord rodney and the noble lord lord shaughnessy <e> <s> it is clear that the views expressed reflect deeply-held concerns about aspects of this bill and as my noble friend lord carrington said in his opening speech it is a most unusual bill <e> <s> indeed it is unique <e> <s> we are the final executors of a responsibility which has for many years been out of its time <e> <s> as a result of our deliberations the full authority for the constitution of canada will be transferred to its rightful place <e>", "<cs> my off-the-cuff reaction to that my lords is that we have received a request from the government of canada that we should proceed with it forthwith and that any amendment which sought to prevent that would therefore be out of keeping at least with the spirit of the standing order <e> <s> but i hesitate to offer a definitive ruling and i suggest the noble lord takes the matter up with the authorities of the house at an appropriate moment <e>", "<cs> my lords an investigation was taking place into mr beausires fate <e> <s> this investigation was suspended but we understand that there is a possibility of these inquiries being reopened and we very much hope that that will happen <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i am aware there is no doubt about mr beausires status that is that he is an anglo-chilean dual national <e> <s> therefore while the difficulties surrounding his circumstances relate to chile we do not have a status in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords we deplore violations of human rights wherever they occur and have reacted clearly and consistently to such violations <e> <s> the views of her majestys government and our partners on developments in iran have been made clear to the iranian authorities as have our views on poland to the polish government <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of deportation from this country would have to be considered on its merits in the light of the circumstances prevailing at the time <e> <s> but as i said in the answer we have made our views about human rights violations in iran very clear not least in the unstarred question that i answered a week or so ago about the bahis <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not see the programme to which the noble baroness has referred and i do not know what it was that the american officials confessed to or indeed which officials were confessing the error of their ways <e> <s> but it behoves all ministers and officials to confess the errors of their ways occasionally <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords ingenuity knows no bounds but even he is hard pressed to draw an analogy between what he asks and the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i should answer that question in the same way as i answered the noble lord lord mayhew <e>", "<cs> my lords let me say yet again that the government deplore violations of human rights wherever they may occur and we lose no opportunity in expressing our views on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord renton for explaining this amendment and indeed for the helpful approach taken by his noble friend and mine lord campbell of alloway in their earlier discussions on this <e> <s> it is true as the noble lord lord bishopston has said that this phrase does not appear in the definition of the offence in article of the convention <e> <s> however the bill creates a new criminal offence and it was considered necessary to adapt the definition of the offence of the convention but without changing its substance so as to be consistent with the laws of the united kingdom and ensure no room for ambiguity <e> <s> since a threat to continue to detain a person in order to compel another person to do or abstain from doing any act is one of the elements of the offence it was necessary to ensure that a situation which fell within those elements but which was not in any ordinary sense the taking of a hostage was not caught by the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that my noble friend lord drumalbyn is right in saying that if i may say so <e> <s> the provisions of clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bishopston may be interested to know that the convention requires ratification by states in order to enter into force <e> <s> our ratification would be the th and it is likely therefore that the convention will enter into force without much further delay <e> <s> indeed i would hope that the fact of our ratification will encourage other states to complete their own domestic legislation <e> <s> i happen to know for example that the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords the first part of my noble friends supplementary question as to whether or not these premises enjoy immunity from the payment of rates of course lies at the heart of this problem <e> <s> in fact camden council have asked for a certificate from the foreign office in connection with that point and we are now carefully considering how to respond <e>", "<cs> my lords what lies at the heart of the soviet view of this matter is not something on which i could expand <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not have anything in moscow analogous to the soviet trade delegations here in the united kingdom <e> <s> however generally speaking it is true to say that our trade representatives if that is the right word do form part of our missions overseas <e>", "<cs> my lords i think my noble friend has underestimated the time this matter has been under consideration but i must say in the same breath that i am afraid i cannot predict when the government will be able to form their view on the matter <e>", "<cs> quite right too my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the government remain firmly committed to seek the adoption of a generally acceptable treaty by consensus on all aspects of the law of the sea <e> <s> the united states concerns on deep sea mining and outstanding matters raised by other delegations will continue to be the subject of negotiations during the session which has just begun in new york but obviously i cannot predict the outcome <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend on both points <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is an oversimplification of the position of the united states <e> <s> certainly in the draft that had been agreed prior to the change of administration in the united states there were a number of good things and some less good things as well <e> <s> we agree with the united states that among the less good things was the deep sea-bed mining rgime and that is the matter which is particularly exercising the united states now <e> <s> we certainly believe there is room for improvement in those proposals <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> as the prime minister has indicated there is time for heads of state and government to go to the nato summit which lasts one day and the special session which lasts five weeks <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that my right honourable friend the prime minister has not yet finalised the dates upon which she will be attending <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly the special session will be an important event in the disarmament calendar <e> <s> it will be considering proposals that emanate from the existing machinery in geneva <e> <s> but it is important to remember that the special session is in fact a deliberative occasion rather than one on which treaties or other such documents will be agreed <e>", "<cs> my lords the permanent head of our delegation to the unssd will in fact be the permanent head of our delegation in geneva <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have just said the permanent head of our delegation will be the present permanent head of our mission in geneva <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord carrington i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i understand that it has been agreed through the usual channels that we should have a short debate on schedule b stand part <e> <s> i therefore do not propose to say anything at this point <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i have to say that i really cannot help the noble lord <e> <s> as was explained and repeated during the second reading debate by myself by my noble friend lord carrington and by many other noble lords who spoke although i recognise that there were contrary views expressed as well this is not a matter for the british government <e> <s> the inclusions or omissions in the bill of rights which <e>", "<cs> in answer to the first part of the intervention by the noble lord lord jenkins of putney i will merely say that i have nothing to add to what i said in reply to the noble lord lord stewart of fulham <e> <s> in response to the second part of the noble lords intervention i would refer him to my own words during the second reading debate of this bill last week <e> <s> i shall read my own words from column of <e>", "<cs> these provisions were drafted in canada by canadians for canadians <e> <s> i regret that i cannot help the noble baroness further <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that my noble friend feels that way but i have to tell him that the doctrine of collective responsibility is such that i cannot speak from this box except as a member of her majestys government <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord lord scarman of course expressed a detailed and considered view on certain of the provisions of this bill and for me to agree or disagree with the noble and learned lord would be to express a view upon the merits of these proposals <e> <s> i decline to do so <e>", "<cs> i understand the anxiety of noble lords on these matters but the questions that have been put to me during the course of the debate this afternoon have in general in fact i think exclusively been ones of interpretation <e> <s> i believe your lordships generally agree that it would not have been right for me to offer interpretation of what is essentially canadian legislation albeit by virtue of an historical anomaly currently passing through your lordships house <e> <s> the final word on interpretation of this legislation will therefore lie in due course with the canadian courts and i hope your lordships will forgive me therefore for not offering further elucidation this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i will now repeat the statement being made by my honourable friend the minister of state at the foreign office in another place <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords a number of points have been raised by noble lords and i am obliged to them for their response to the statement <e> <s> it is true that a flag was hoisted for a time while the party or the bulk of the party was ashore <e> <s> i cannot confirm that it was or was not an argentinian flag although i imagine it was <e> <s> the vessel as the noble lord lord shackleton pointed out was chartered by a company operating in the area <e> <s> i understand that the company informed the british embassy in buenos aires that they were sailing for south georgia but it had been made quite clear to them that they had to seek clearance from the british authorities at grytviken before landing on british territory <e> <s> as for the small number of personnel who are still there as the statement said we are making arrangements to ensure their early departure <e> <s> the question of their remaining does not therefore arise <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> it appears that the personnel involved represented an argentine commercial company run by a mr davidoff which has a contract to remove equipment from disused whaling stations on south georgia <e>", "<cs> my lords plans for the future of hms endurance are for longer-term consideration in the light of developments <e> <s> we are of course committed to support and defend the falkland islands and their dependencies to the best of our ability <e>", "<cs> we have made clear to the argentines my lords that this situation is not of our seeking <e> <s> our hope is that this unfortunate incident can be surmounted with the least possible consequences for our political relations <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept for a moment that my right honourable friend the prime minister has been humiliated <e> <s> on the contrary we have some very remarkable achievements to our credit in this area and i believe further achievements are likely to he gained before long <e> <s> as for the difficulties with the fishing policy and agricultural policy the governments views on those are well known and we are working hard to correct those problems <e>", "<cs> my lords the proposal which emerged at the meeting earlier this week is one that has some good aspects to it and some less good aspects <e> <s> the whole matter is to be discussed again at a special meeting of foreign ministers on rd april <e> <s> we very much hope that substantial progress will be made on that occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords at the last occasion upon which the british people were formally consulted as to their views on the common market a substantial majority said that they favoured our continued membership <e> <s> those who now propose our withdrawal should ponder on the amount of exports for example which we make to the european community something like half our total <e>", "<cs> my lords i would be reluctant to put a fixed time limit on these matters because we move forward by consensus and to impose some artificial time barrier is not in my view helpful to reaching that consensus <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree it would be a disaster if we withdrew from the eec <e> <s> on the other hand it is a mistake i think to belittle unduly some of the problems which exist for example the creation of surpluses within the agricultural policy and the wine lagoon to which the noble lord referred <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect that goes fairly wide of the question on the order paper but certainly as i said in answer to the noble lord lord shinwell the common fishery policy does have some difficulties for us and we are working to eliminate these problems <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not choose to use the almost inflammatory words which the noble lord has chosen to use <e> <s> but certainly i cannot deny that the community budget is very unbalanced by the size of the agricultural budget although it is worth pointing out that the net percentage of the community budget taken by the agricultural policy has declined since we took office <e>", "<cs> my lords the government said right from the outset that there were aspects of the community which we thought ought to be corrected <e> <s> indeed our community partners early on agreed that there was a problem in relation to our own budget contribution <e> <s> that problem was largely solved for the earlier years and we now hope that the problems we have been discussing with regard to agriculture and fisheries can likewise be resolved in the same spirit of constructive compromise <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e> <s> we are now nearing the end of the process of consideration of this bill in your lordships house <e> <s> as your lordships know the purpose of this legislation is to give effect to a request in relation to the canadian constitution which was laid before parliament in december last year on the basis of a solemn address to her majesty from both houses of the canadian parliament <e> <s> this procedure follows a constitutional precedent stretching back for well over a century during which the parliament in westminster has passed on no less than occasions acts amending the canadian constitution <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lord lord mayhew i would say that my noble friends visit will be considerably more than a mere courtesy visit as he suggested <e> <s> it will of course be an opportunity for an exchange of views at the highest level within israel <e> <s> not only will my noble friend be able to convey his views to the israeli government but the visit will be of great value to him to hear their views at first hand as well <e> <s> it is i think important to maintain the dialogue in this situation and not to cut off communication as would happen if the visit were to be cancelled <e>", "<cs> my lords we view the developments on the west bank with grave concern and we deplore the dismissal by the israeli military authorities of the democratically-elected mayors of nablus and ramallah as well as the earlier dismissal of the mayor of el-birch <e> <s> we have again appealed and i would do so now if i may for an end to the violence there <e> <s> it can only harm the prospects of a settlement which gives the palestinian people the right to choose their own future <e>", "<cs> my lords i absolutely agree with the noble lord that the israelis are entitled to the kind of assurances to which he has referred <e> <s> but one must say that one of the sources from which they seek the assurance namely the plo is one organisation with which they refuse to have any dialogue at all <e>", "<cs> my lords that is really an extension of the point that i think was being made by the noble lord lord shinwell but i should prefer not to use words such as outrageous in any context in the middle east situation hoping that we can move forward to a consensus agreement in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the purposes of the visit of my noble friend will be to convey to the israeli government the views of the british government on the various events that have been taking place recently in particular the most unhappy events on the west bank and i think that if the visit were to be cancelled that opportunity would be lost <e> <s> i am firmly convinced i must say that the way forward is to maintain a dialogue with all the parties to this dispute for to cut them off as is suggested in the question would not contribute to that end <e>", "<cs> my lords of course it is true that israel is happily a democracy and hopefully the views of their government will reflect the views of the israeli people <e>", "<cs> my lords the plo is not of course a state as we would understand it and therefore the concept of recognition may not be precisely the right description of the relationship which should be evolved with that organisation <e> <s> what we have said and what i repeat now is that there is no prospect of peace in the middle east without taking into account the views of the plo who clearly represent a substantial portion of palestinian opinion <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so that is a rather comprehensive supplementary question <e> <s> however i think that the situation is not necessarily as black as the noble lord paints it <e> <s> certainly swapo and others have found some difficulties with proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords what has been proposed is a mixed system of proportional representation and single-member constituencies which we think need not be unduly complicated and indeed could be put into effect without excessive expense or delay <e> <s> we believe that it would be fair to all parties competing in the elections and it is certainly not designed to favour one party or the other <e> <s> we are now considering the difficulties which the parties have seen in these proposals to see as i said what gloss can be put on them to ease the difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords we remain hopeful that the original timetable can be achieved <e> <s> i would not regard the present situation as deadlocked as the noble lord describes it and perhaps in due course there will be better things to report <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i would agree with my noble friend about that <e> <s> in my opinion the british airports authority is a very well-managed organisation and discharges its duties admirably <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is i am informed that a direction of this nature has never been given under this section at least and therefore there is no case law upon which i could base an answer to the noble baroness <e> <s> in the absence of any guidance from the courts or elsewhere i think i ought to refrain from offering a legal advice to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry about my improper answers <e> <s> i can assure the noble baroness that is has nothing to do with her improper questions <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i ought to give to the noble lord the same answer as i gave to the noble baroness because to answer the noble lord in view of the way that he has put his question would be to give a specific legal advice much like a counsels opinion which would be inappropriate from this box <e> <s> but on the face of it i should have thought that the type of direction which the noble lord is suggesting would fall outside the scope of the subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords with your permission <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to both noble lords for their interventions following this statement <e> <s> if i may first respond to the noble lord lord bruce on the detail of the tindemans-thorn proposals these have so far been made only on an informal and personal basis by the presidents of the council and the commission simply in the nature of a framework for the negotiations <e> <s> there is no formal proposal yet and i have no doubt that when one is <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot go as far as the noble lord asks me to go with regard to the thorn-tindemans proposals <e> <s> they are only a framework for discussion at the present time and the united kingdom has accepted then as such but of course the french president dismissed them out of hand it seems <e> <s> on the questions about central america and particularly the point about aid referred to in the statement individual member states and the community will doubtless be considering this in the context of their own financial constraints <e> <s> on the political aspect of affairs in central america i think that a european community initiative at this moment would unduly complicate the issue in that part of the world but we broadly welcome the mexican initiative which is to help to bring the parties together <e>", "<cs> my lords the government share the desire inherent in the noble lords question that the negotiations currently going on with regard to the mandate should be conclusive and not just a short-term thing which would lead as the noble lord rightly points out to another discussion and further disagreement in a short time to come <e> <s> this negotiation is now renewing the arrangements which were agreed rather less than three years ago <e> <s> we certainly think that the negotiations now being conducted should reach a conclusion which should last longer than that <e>", "<cs> my lords first on the question of central america as i said in answer to the noble lord lord walston a moment ago i do not think that a european community initiative with regard to el salvador or any other country in that region would be appropriate at the present time <e> <s> but we broadly welcome the mexican initiative which is to help to bring the parties together <e> <s> the mexican concept of a regional approach has some merit in this situation but i think it would be a fallacy to imagine that agreement will be soon or easily reached in that area <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not answering that point which the noble lord did indeed put to me earlier <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that the government attach the greatest importance to the understanding that decisions on matters of major national interest are taken by unanimity and there is no question of our accepting any erosion of this principle <e>", "<cs> my lords that was again touched on during the discussion and i think it is referred to in the document which i am placing in the library <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will find that helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords the major responsibility for unemployment must of course lie with member states <e> <s> but there is however an important complementary role for community action for example in improving the co-ordination of member states economic policies in particular fighting inflation through the operation of the social and regional fund <e> <s> the social fund in fact provides significant assistance for training and employment schemes to help the unemployed and those threatened by unemployment particularly through an increase in the capital of the european investment bank <e> <s> but with regard to youth unemployment specifically which i think is uppermost in the noble lords mind my right honourable friend the secretary of state for employment announced on th december the governments plan to help the young unemployed in and beyond <e> <s> essentially the youth opportunities programme will be expanded to cover entrants next year with new style one-year training places <e> <s> in therefore the yop will be developing towards the new youth training schemes which will provide for young people at any one time mainly through new one-year training courses in industry and commerce <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is most mistaken in the last assertion which she put to your lordships <e> <s> i am aware of course that in general the arrangements that we have in this country for financing our aviation security are not those which are followed in other countries <e> <s> not all countries however choose to make this a charge upon the taxpayer which i think the noble baroness has in mind <e> <s> in the united states for example the charge falls upon the airlines themselves <e> <s> as for the statement which the noble baroness is asking for we have no intention as i said of making a statement in the way that the noble baroness asks but these matters will certainly be taken into account by my honourable friend in the review of which she is aware <e>", "<cs> i must say my lords that i somewhat resent the suggestion that the answers i give to the noble baroness do not comply with the <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case perhaps i may refer the noble baroness to the answer i gave to her in correspondence on rd march <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank both noble lords in particular the noble lord lord bruce of donington for his helpful and constructive reception of this statement <e> <s> my thanks are no less due to the noble lord lord mais although he did not go into the same detail <e> <s> may i deal first with the points put to me by the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e>", "<cs> my lords as to the effect of these measures upon argentina it may be helpful if i say that some to per cent <e> <s> of argentinian reserves are believed to be held in united kingdom banks or by way of stocks and securities held in this country <e> <s> it is therefore certain i would say that this will have a very significant effect on argentinas economy <e>", "<cs> my lords as for advice to british firms it is not possible to go further than the statement does in terms of specific advice because circumstances will vary from company to company <e> <s> a total trade embargo with argentina is certainly something that we could consider but we would need to do that in close concert with our allies in the european community and elsewhere <e> <s> in any event an embargo by the united kingdom acting in isolation would probably not have any major effect and it is therefore crucial i believe to secure the support of our friends and allies in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments position with regard to this matter generally was very eloquently and adequately described by my right honourable friend the prime minister when she spoke in the other place on saturday and indeed by my noble friend lord carrington when he spoke to your lordships on the same day <e> <s> suggest that my noble friend reads the <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that will be a matter for the national governments concerned <e> <s> external trade as the noble lord will know is a matter in which the european community has competence as the expression goes and therefore it is right and proper that we should discuss matters of that nature with them <e> <s> the matters to which the statutory instrument refers and about which the noble lord lord bruce of donington was asking me fall within our own national competence <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak without a specific brief on that particular point but i imagine the position is that if a premium has been received then the contract is in force but that a claim could not be paid until these restrictions were lifted <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that the international committee of the red cross has made an approach to her majestys government along the lines which the noble baroness has described <e> <s> we naturally welcome that approach <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that it is not the practice to pay compensation in these circumstances <e> <s> it is the case that in a situation such as this one costs will be incurred and will have to fall on someone but defending our national honour is not something that we can do for free <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend that the italian and french governments have given us the utmost support in this matter and i have no doubt will be considering acting along on the lines my noble friend suggests <e> <s> i understand that at present there is only one argentinian vessel in a united kingdom port but one or two are due either today or soon <e> <s> i will certainly see that the point made by my noble friend is taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his kind words and i am certain that my right honourable friend the new secretary of state for foreign affairs will also be reassured by them <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that some of the things the plo have said and some of the things they say they stand for are not likely to contribute to a settlement in the middle east <e> <s> but the <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend and the noble baroness lady gaitskell put their fingers in their different ways on the essence of the problem in the middle east and i do not think it would be appropriate for me at question time to expand on what they said <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear i cannot go further than i have both today and on other occasions from this box when i say for all their failings and failings they indeed have the plo represent an important segment of palestinian opinion and their views must be taken into account when we get nearer to a settlement than we are at the present time <e> <s> but as i said some of the things the plo have said some of the things they have done and some of the things they stand for are clearly not compatible with a settlement anywhere <e>", "<cs> the plo is actually an umbrella organisation my lords and a large number of subsidiary organisations are affiliated to it <e> <s> it is certainly the case that some of those affiliated organisations have in accordance with their own admissions been responsible for some appalling acts of terrorism <e>", "<cs> it would probably not be helpful to draw parallels between the two my lords but it is certainly the case that recent acts by the israeli government have caused the greatest anxiety among some of their western friends not least the government of the united kingdom and i certainly include among those acts what has happened recently on the west bank and golan heights <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to reassure the noble lord that her majestys government are determined and have no doubts as to the validity of our position with regard to the falklands to which i presume the noble lord is referring and we shall certainly restore that country to our own control in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not responsible for what was said between and but i think that the position with regard to the middle east is certainly different from the position with regard to the various countries and events to which my noble friend refers <e> <s> we think that a settlement in the middle east will be achieved only by means of a consensus and not by the use of force <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that the plo will have to change their position on a number of matters before a settlement can be agreed but it will also be important for the israelis to have a dialogue with the plo to achieve that change <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the only deduction that could properly be drawn from what the noble lord says would be that the only possibility of achieving a settlement in the middle east would be by some force of arms and the government do not accept that position <e>", "<cs> my lords the proposal which the noble lord puts forward is one which has in fact been put forward by the soviet union in recent months <e> <s> that is not to say that we dismiss the proposal because of that but any such conference would certainly need to be very well prepared if it were to make any progress in the present circumstances <e> <s> as to the proposals of saudi arabia they are certainly important proposals which indeed have a good deal in common with the venice declaration of the european community last year and certainly together with that declaration they might form the basis for further progress <e>", "<cs> my lords the statutory responsibility for air safety lies with the civil aviation authority <e> <s> the authority keeps under review the requirements governing the design and construction of passenger aircraft and the standards to which they are operated <e> <s> this is a continuing process involving discussion with a wide cross-section of the aviation industry including <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that the report to which the noble lord refers provided some interesting food for thought in these matters but it is perhaps worth saying that the problems are not as simple as some of the commentaries on that report made out <e> <s> i particularly noticed the article in the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl is wholly mistaken in that view if i may say so <e> <s> for the record the civil aviation authority has introduced amendments to its airworthiness requirements in the past months which have been aimed at improving the safety of civil transport aircraft <e> <s> it has planned a further amendments which it hopes to introduce during the next few years <e> <s> it has also issued nine airworthiness notices during the last months dealing with the raising of safety standards <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with my noble friend in that matter and i can certainly give him the assurance for which he asks <e> <s> there is none better than he if i may say so to comment on these things <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand it has been a long-standing principle that those who seek to leave these shores lose their automatic entitlement to benefit of this kind <e> <s> however it is perhaps worth saying that of the or so people living abroad who are in receipt of retirement or widows pensions in fact receive increases of one kind or another under either european community regulations or reciprocal agreements <e>", "<cs> my lords the million is an annual figure which would have been arrived at by i think a somewhat complicated calculation no doubt including actuarial considerations which the noble lord described <e> <s> but as i say the general principle always has been that once people leave these shores they lose their automatic entitlement to these benefits <e>", "<cs> my lords the latter point is of course a very important one <e> <s> these are very often people who have for quite proper reasons chosen to live abroad and therefore are not within the compass of the inland revenue <e> <s> but i think the other point that my noble friend made is right <e>", "<cs> my lords i imagine it is a swings and roundabouts situation to be fair <e> <s> i think that although there are some countries with a lower rate of inflation than ours there are also some with a higher rate <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of the precise group of people to which the noble lords question related but i take note of what he says <e>", "<cs> to be truthful my lords i am not aware of the answer to the noble lords supplementary question <e> <s> perhaps i can look into the matter and write to him <e>", "<cs> i hope i can dispel the noble lords fears <e> <s> i am advised that the bill comes into force on royal assent <e> <s> therefore if the bill is passed as presently drafted section of the act would indeed be repealed when this bill receives royal assent if it does <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that the present arrangement is unsatisfactory <e> <s> it will be necessary i understand to change the existing supplementary benefit conditions of entitlement regulations and that will be done as soon as agreement has been reached on the way forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that the effect of the recent decision is unsatisfactory and that is why the government are reconsidering the matter in the way that i have described <e> <s> i must however say that the recent decision is currently the subject of an appeal to the commissioner and i would not wish to forecast the outcome of that appeal <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot precisely forecast the time-scale upon which my honourable friend will be bound in reaching his decision but i can assure the noble lord that he is seized of the urgency of the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baronesss question goes to the very heart of the question <e> <s> as i said in the original answer the intention is that the hours should relate only to classroom work <e>", "<cs> my lords the appeal procedure is of course independent of government <e> <s> i am sure that the noble baroness would not wish us to intervene in any formal way in this but i will certainly see if there is any difficulty with the time taken by appeals and perhaps write to the noble baroness if there is <e>", "<cs> my lords in this context different arrangements apply to those over <e> <s> perhaps i might write to the noble baroness with the details <e>", "<cs> i do not think the noble baroness is quite correct in that <e> <s> if an employee is absent for seven days for example he then becomes eligible for statutory sick pay by virtue of the fact that he has reached the qualifying period and sick pay becomes payable for the full seven days <e>", "<cs> i confess that i come as a novice to these matters <e> <s> i think i was right in what i said <e> <s> i shall double check the position and write to the noble baroness if i was wrong <e>", "<cs> may i in answer to the important point made by the noble baroness say that the period over which the average wage will be calculated for the purpose of this provision is the eight-week period preceding the sickness which is the point that the noble baroness was anxious about <e> <s> the amendment however goes wider than that and would remove from the list of those excluded from receiving statutory sick pay people who earned less than the amount on which contributions become payable <e> <s> this is currently a week <e> <s> the effect of that would be to widen the scheme far beyond its intention <e> <s> it would give ssp entitlement to those on very low earnings who would not normally be entitled to sickness benefit <e> <s> we would thus be putting on employers a statutory liability which the state does not have <e> <s> the payments would cause a loss of revenue to the national insurance fund which could not be recouped in any way from those benefiting since they would by definition be those earning too little to pay contributions <e>", "<cs> with permission i shall speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> these amendments would include in entitlement to statutory sick pay those who fall sick during a stoppage at their place of employment and consequentially on this would remove the exception from this general rule of those with no interest or participation in the dispute <e> <s> the area of trade disputes is a troublesome one as i am sure we all agree <e> <s> when we were considering this scheme in its early stages we looked at employers sick pay practices in a wide variety of industries and found that in general if sickness pre-dated the dispute liability for occupational sick pay was accepted but if it began after the dispute commenced no payment was made <e>", "<cs> may i make two points arising out of that intervention first whether employees in the context of the relations with their fellow employees who feel it invidious to make representations to their employer about their non-participation in a dispute are able to seek sickness benefit <e> <s> the noble baroness explained this and we confirmed it a moment ago <e> <s> indeed as the noble baroness pointed out sometimes they will be better off by claiming sickness benefit than they would be if they were to rely only on the statutory sick pay as provided for in the bill <e>", "<cs> i still feel it would be better if i were to reflect upon the profound nature of the questions that have been put to me and answer them in writing <e> <s> but i take the point of the noble lord lord fletcher <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will forgive me i will finish my remarks and he can intervene again if he still feels dissatisfied <e> <s> i have undertaken to write to the noble lord lord mishcon and i shall be happy to send a copy of that letter to the noble lord lord fletcher <e> <s> in the meantime i wonder whether i can help your lordships further in this way section of the social security act to which i referred earlier provides that a person who has lost employment by reason of a stoppage of work which is due to a trade dispute at his place of employment shall be disqualified from receiving unemployment benefit so long as the stoppage continues <e>", "<cs> i was endeavouring to help the noble lord with the words i used just now in response to what he said earlier and indeed in response to the words of the noble lord lord fletcher <e> <s> the truth is that in a circumstance such as this per cent <e> <s> or more of cases would doubtless be settled by common sense <e> <s> it is likely to be obvious to most people in most cases whether or not a particular employee was concerned with or participating in a dispute <e> <s> i accept that there will be some cases where it is not obvious and where there will be a clear and genuine disagreement between the employer and the employee <e> <s> in those cases the employer will have recourse first to the employers guide which is published by the department to assist in these cases and secondly if necessary ultimately he can refer to the so-called statutory authorities who hear appeals when asked to do so <e> <s> if an employee is refused statutory sick pay by an employer and then seeks sickness benefit it will be up to the authorities to decide whether he is entitled to sickness benefit that is not entitled to statutory sick pay and they will be the ultimate authorities in this matter <e>", "<cs> with respect i was not proposing to answer the case for the amendment by way of a letter <e> <s> i was proposing instead to give the noble lord lord mishcon a considered reflection upon the provisions of the social security act <e> <s> it is not of course the act that is before your lordships now <e> <s> it is the social security and housing benefits bill which i hope will become an act in due course <e> <s> it was a narrow point relating to another act upon which i proposed to write to the noble lord lord mishcon and i hope your lordships will agree that that is an appropriate thing to do <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that the noble baroness could have listened to everything i said <e> <s> she usually does so with such care <e> <s> i endeavoured to explain i accept as i said earlier that i come as a novice to these matters and may not therefore have explained it as clearly as i might have done that the ultimate decision in these matters actually rests as it has done for a good many years with the so-called statutory authorities of the national insurance system who have to <e>", "<cs> your lordships will forgive me if i resist the temptation to join in the exchanges about the relative efficiency of the whips on either side of your lordships house <e> <s> as a former whip i take it as a compliment that the noble lord lord wallace of coslany complains of the majority we manage to achieve from time to time although it is in fact the case that we do not always manage it there have been a good many government defeats in your lordships house in recent years <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord banks has explained this amendment removes the three rates of statutory sick pay which are payable depending upon an employees average earnings and replaces them with a single rate of for all employees <e> <s> it also adds an amount payable for each dependent child to the flat rate of statutory sick pay <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble baroness is right <e> <s> as a general rule someone cannot claim two benefits from the state at the same time <e> <s> there are very often ifs and buts to general assurances of that nature and at the risk of incurring the odium of your lordships once more i should like to undertake to write to the noble baroness if i am wrong <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord replies i should like to correct what i said to the noble baroness lady phillips <e> <s> i understand that widows can in fact draw both their widows pension and statutory sick pay at the same time and i have thus saved myself another stamp <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e> <s> i apologise for intervening yet again <e> <s> i did endeavour to explain that one of the features of this arrangement which we have been anxious to incorporate is that the employer and it is of course the employer who is making the payments in the first instance under this new scheme should not be asked to pay more to the employee than the employee would earn when he was fit <e> <s> that was why we arrived at the particular level that we did arrive at <e>", "<cs> i had hoped that my noble friend was reaching an agreement with the noble baroness on the front bench opposite to settle this matter amicably <e> <s> i am not sure that the intervention just now of the noble baroness was wholly helpful <e> <s> may i say that if there is any excessive complication in this matter much of it stems from the act passed by the previous administration <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is of course right in suggesting that if one deducts from one gets whatever it was <e> <s> the noble baronesss mental arithmetic is vastly superior to mine and that is not a difficult position to achieve i must say <e> <s> however i should perhaps make two points which might have escaped the committees attention but which have been referred to in connection with earlier amendments <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble lord i do not want to indulge in a detailed exchange of figures across the floor of your lordships committee at this moment <e> <s> i could do so at very considerable length i have five or six pages of figures here but i have a feeling that your lordships would be unduly wearied if i were to deploy all the figures which are before me at this moment <e> <s> most of them are contained in the document called <e>", "<cs> there are many members of your lordships house and i am among them i must say who would like to see our legislation in very many areas including this one simpler and easier to understand <e> <s> the difficulty is that when you apply your mind with these good intentions to the structure as one finds it the remedies are not quite so easy to discern <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has explained this amendment is intended to require the secretary of state to take account of the per cent <e> <s> abatement of sickness benefit which was introduced in november when determining the rate of statutory sick pay this autumn <e> <s> i have explained in response to a previous amendment how the rates of statutory sick pay were calculated and my noble friend lord cullen amplified what i said on another occasion <e> <s> essentially they relate quite closely to the rates of sickness benefit so it could be argued that if the rate of sickness benefit had not been abated the rates of statutory sick pay would be higher <e> <s> i accept that there is some force in that argument but before dealing with that point i should like if i may to say a little more about the detailed financial effects of the scheme <e>", "<cs> i think that it is per cent <e> <s> of employees both male and female in full-time employment <e> <s> i have a feeling that it does not include part-time employees many of whom are women <e>", "<cs> what i said earlier was that a widow in receipt of a widows pension could also receive statutory sick pay <e>", "<cs> sickness benefit <e> <s> i must confess i am not quite certain whether sickness benefit is also available with a widows pension <e> <s> perhaps i could let the noble baroness know later ah <e> <s> manna from heaven <e> <s> as i said earlier statutory sick pay and widows pension are payable together but sickness benefit is not payable with widows pension <e>", "<cs> i suppose it is true to say that whatever index is selected for use one year or another somebody will say that it is the wrong index and that they would have been better off if yet another index had been devised or if another existing index had been used <e> <s> the wording of the clause closely follows the wording which appears in the social security act <e> <s> therefore i can give an assurance that the index to be used for this purpose will be the united kingdom retail price index <e> <s> that is the index which has been used for this purpose for a number of years <e> <s> to use another index for this statutory sick pay figure for example the tax and prices index to which the noble baroness referred would mean that we were using a different index for statutory sick pay as compared with some of the other national insurance benefits <e> <s> i hope the noble baroness agrees that this would cause confusion and would not be desirable <e> <s> as i say therefore it is proposed that the united kingdom retail price index should be used for the purposes of this measure <e> <s> in the light of that assurance i hope the noble baroness will agree that this clause should stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> one of the difficulties in handling legislation like this as noble lords will by now have appreciated is that sometimes one needs to rely upon the advice of ones officials <e> <s> this evening i have received a note which i think tells me that the regulations will be produced immediately after royal ascot but when i look a little closer i think it says royal assent <e> <s> i can give an assurance that the regulations will be kept as simple as possible that they will be produced immediately after royal assent and that they will be accompanied by an employers guide <e> <s> the local offices will stand ready to help employers to organise any instructional courses which may prove to be necessary <e> <s> the employers guide will appear just after the regulations in july assuming that the bill has received royal assent by then and it will be available also to employees and to the public in general <e> <s> we are looking at the possibility of publishing the regulations or at least the employers guide in other languages <e> <s> but that presents difficulties and i cannot give an assurance about it at present <e> <s> however we recognise its desirability and we shall see what can be done <e>", "<cs> my honourable friend the minister of state whose words have been quoted at considerable length this evening indeed dealt with this matter when it was considered in the other place <e> <s> of course statutory sick pay as provided for in this bill is earnings for tax and contribution purposes <e> <s> as i have already said in connection with a number of amendments this evening it will perhaps form only part of the sick pay entitlement of employees under their occupational schemes <e> <s> but if it was earnings for supplementary benefit purposes it would of course exclude people from supplementary benefit as such and that was the point that my honourable friend mr rossi was making when he spoke in the other place on st january <e>", "<cs> the difficulty is that we have to live in the real world <e>", "<cs> the real world is that if there is a circumstance in which a work person and this applies as much to management as it does to shop floor workers or any other kind of worker is substantially or even marginally better off when he is sick i fear that there will be an inducement for some a few and only a few to suggest that they are sick when they are not <e> <s> this i think is a most unhappy inducement and is not the situation that we seek to create under the provisions of this bill <e>", "<cs> it would be a brave noble lord or noble baroness who would suggest that there were no circumstances under which that would happen <e> <s> i accept that they are rare <e> <s> i imagine that the number of people who seek deliberately to mislead in order to achieve access to benefit of whatever kind is comparatively small but they do exist <e> <s> it would be folly and mistaken to suggest that they do not exist <e> <s> they exist but on a small scale <e>", "<cs> we are not proposing to penalise anyone under this legislation <e> <s> what we are seeking to avoid is actually rewarding them for their misdeeds and also to avoid putting temptation in their path <e> <s> we are all human and if additional remuneration is available to us when we are genuinely sick then on occasion we are certainly tempted to consider whether we are sick or whether we are not and it is that temptation that we seek to remove by this provision <e>", "<cs> that is a question for the right reverend prelates who sit in your lordships house and not i think for me <e> <s> if part of these full wages the element representing statutory sick pay is to be exempt from national insurance contributions the employee would be taking home more money when sick than when at work <e> <s> as i earlier said for someone entitled to the standard rate of statutory sick pay the advantage could be more than in a full week of sickness <e>", "<cs> if i may say so that has been the position of successive administrations and not just the one of noble lords opposite over the years <e> <s> i was brought up to believe that if you look after the pennies the pounds will look after themselves <e> <s> i fear that successive governments have not paid attention to that worthwhile dictum and as a result of not looking after the pennies the pounds have run away with themselves <e> <s> it is necessary to have regard to some of the smaller sums in government expenditure programmes so that the major cost overruns that have been such a feature of government administrations of both complexions over the years will not cause such difficulties <e> <s> i would not accept the argument that just because we have indeed been able to make certain savings in other areas or indeed in related areas of government activity we are therefore in a position to blow all that straight away <e>", "<cs> i can well understand the feeling in the minds of noble lords and noble baronesses opposite that a junior minister of a conservative administration and a hereditary peer to boot is unlikely to have much idea of the real world but i should like to tell the committee that before i had the privilege of joining the present government i did indeed work and live in the real world <e> <s> i can for example tell the noble baroness about sick notes <e> <s> she was not entirely clear about what happens to a sick note <e> <s> i know because i have had a sick note and i can tell the committee what i did with it <e> <s> i gave it to my employer first of all to tell him that i was not feeling too good <e> <s> he then passed it on to the dhss in order to process the application for sickness benefit as it was <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly would not describe the transplant procedure as hit or miss as i think the noble lord did <e> <s> it is in fact by far the best treatment for this kind of illness and is only inhibited from expanding further because of the shortage of kidneys available for transplant purposes <e> <s> it is unfortunately the case that last year the supply of kidneys declined somewhat and therefore the number of transplant operations was fewer last year <e> <s> but there are encouraging signs this year that the number is picking up again <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord rightly pointed out the number of kidneys is limited and that certainly restricts the number of patients who can be treated in this way <e> <s> the other types of treatment for example dialysis of two or three different kinds is certainly an alternative but it is less satisfactory both in terms of cost and from the patients own point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords i would certainly agree with the noble lord that this should be done <e> <s> the kidney donor card is a red card like this <e> <s> i understand that supplies are available in your lordships library so those of your lordships who do not carry such a card and who would like to can do so if you wish <e>", "<cs> no my lords only his heart <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly acknowledge the apprehensions of the people involved as the noble lord said <e> <s> the conference was i think in fact conducted by a commercial organisation and the government did not therefore participate in the conference although we had an observer present <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady jeger and other noble lords and ladies who have spoken will probably not be surprised to hear that the government cannot accept this amendment <e> <s> the per cent abatement of short-term benefits and invalidity benefit in november was part of a package of measures designed to secure essential public expenditure reductions <e> <s> it was carried out in anticipation of the taxation of these benefits and it takes from claimants overall very much less than the tax would have yielded <e> <s> we have given a commitment that the per cent <e> <s> abatement of invalidity pension will be restored when the benefit is brought into tax but we have said on many occasions that the restoration of the abatement in the case of the other benefits would have to he considered in the light of the economic and other circumstances prevailing at the time that each benefit was to be brought into tax <e> <s> proposals for taxing sickness benefit have not yet been brought forward and we have no plans to restore the abatement of this benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a formal complaint procedure for these matters <e> <s> the local family practitioner committee would wish to look into any such case as the noble lord describes and the complaint should be made within eight weeks of the event but if there is any such occurrence falling outside the ambit of the complaint procedure and the noble lord would like to draw it to my attention i should be happy to look into it <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very relevant point and again if the noble lord will draw my attention to any particular difficulty i shall be happy to look into it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that in the first instance that would be a matter for the family practitioner committee to which i referred just now but i certainly think that any wrongly made charges ought to be refunded <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the occasions when doctors should or should not charge for certificates of this nature are quite clearly laid down in the doctors terms of service and the matter which is referred to in the question is in fact covered by paragraph of the doctors terms of service so i would not necessarily agree that there is need for greater clarification of these matters but i am certainly open to be convinced if the noble lord wants to persuade me otherwise <e> <s> as for the wish of doctors to charge or not to charge there are circumstances i think when doctors should very properly make a charge for an examination particularly when a patient is not suffering from any particular disease but needs a certificate for some private purpose <e> <s> i gather for example that a number of london doctors were somewhat concerned recently to be asked to examine people prior to the recent london marathon to make sure that they were fit to participate in that event but that perhaps is another matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to my noble friend is of course that the figure i gave was an average one <e> <s> in a few cases local authorities have seen fit to reduce expenditure on these services because they have apprehended greater priorities elsewhere but it is also true to say of course that some local authorities have increased their expenditure at rates greater than the ones i gave <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not denying that services have declined in some areas and of course the noble lord has put his finger on a particular area where a particular service has been reduced but the house will appreciate that local authorities have a wide range of discretion as to the order of priorities which they apply to the different services they provide in their particular area <e> <s> in some areas where the total expenditure over all the services may have increased it is still possible to see one particular service which has been reduced for probably very good local reasons <e>", "<cs> no my lords we certainly have imposed global restraints upon local authority expenditure with which the noble lord and the house will be familiar but of course it has been necessary to contain the very sharp rate of growth of local authority expenditure which we inherited when we came into office <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to confess to your lordships that having only recently come into my present responsibilities i have not yet been able to catch up with all the reading that i should have done but i hope to do so before too long <e> <s> the fact is that some local authorities for perfectly proper political reasons draw attention to certain cuts that they have had to make but they sometimes fail to mention the growth in other areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not agree that any particular figure has no relevance <e> <s> it certainly does have relevance in the context in which the figure is prepared but it is true to say that figures can sometimes be used for purposes other than those for which they were intended <e>", "<cs> my lords i would certainly endorse what my noble friend says <e> <s> the work that is carried on by people working in these services is in almost every case exemplary <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a good deal of material to get through in the next minutes or so and therefore i hope your lordships will forgive me if i proceed rather more quickly than i normally would <e> <s> i am of course delighted to have been given the opportunity to take part in this debate this afternoon particularly because that debate has been enhanced by the maiden speech of the right reverend prelate the bishop of exeter which i found both stimulating and inspiring <e>", "<cs> my noble friend reminds me that she was referring particularly to the eec <e> <s> i fear that my noble friend is probably correct <e> <s> it is the governments intention to reduce the number of custodial sentences made and to develop the facilities necessary for effective community-based disposal <e> <s> i shall have more to say about that in a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i misunder <e>", "<cs> i accept that in that specific context the noble baroness lady david was referring to the removal of the married mans tax allowance with a possible redistribution of funds and the resources thus made available <e> <s> i said earlier that that is a matter which forms part of the green paper proposals on which consultation is now being undertaken <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has fired about eight barrels at us this evening <e> <s> in the six seconds since she sat down i am afraid that i have not been able to marshall all the answers but i shall cover as many points as i can and write to her with pleasure on any points that i omit <e> <s> indeed my noble friend lady faithfull may well wish to deal with some of the points when she comes to reply <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord i think that he over-eggs the pudding somewhat in regard to the announcements made yesterday which in any event have no relation to the health service which is the subject of the question on the order paper <e> <s> i think the offer that has been made through the nurses and midwives whitley council is a very proper one and i hope that it will be accepted <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> it was something in excess of per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords the increase for members of parliament is of course per cent <e> <s> which is somewhat less than the latest offer to the nurses through their whitley council <e> <s> as for the other matters to which the noble lord refers they really have no relation to this particular matter <e> <s> but perhaps i may say that they were of course related to increases forgone in some years past <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder who was responsible for that <e>", "<cs> my lords there was indeed some catching up to be done but the noble lord and his colleagues had been in office for some years before that <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble lord accurately reflects the truth of the position <e> <s> as i said earlier in response to one of my noble friends the percentage increase that has been allowed to nurses in recent years is very substantial <e> <s> with regard to other increases that have been announced recently in other areas there was a very considerable element of catching up in those increases <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords <e> <s> of course these decisions are always very difficult and i cannot think that they have found a solution on the other side of the iron curtain <e>", "<cs> not without notice my lords <e> <s> in any event i am not responsible nor are the government for what is paid to secretaries in the other place <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the accuracy of my noble friends observations if that is what he says <e> <s> i have no means of checking them but i am not sure what inference to draw <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not seek to gloss over the announcements relating to other salaries to which the noble lord and other noble lords have referred <e> <s> but they do not relate to the question which is upon the order paper and in any event different considerations apply <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that all my right honourable friends are well aware of the strong views held by the members of the health service and by others in respect of this matter <e> <s> but of course we have to establish an order of priority and if additional funds were made available for a wage settlement now that would mean a reduction in the level of services in the health service which i do not think is what the noble lord would wish <e>", "<cs> my lords i think some of the funds to which i have referred have already been used for that purpose on a small scale <e> <s> there can be no doubt of the importance of play and recreation to the mental physical and social development of handicapped children and indeed the dhss is already making grants to the save the children fund for example of to help with play schemes for mentally handicapped children in hospitals <e> <s> another grant of for example has gone to the handicapped playground association <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i wholly endorse the sentiments expressed by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords these matters actually cut across two or three government departments <e> <s> i know that my noble friend has recently written to my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment on these matters and my right honourable friend will be replying very shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble baroness is asking me something slightly different <e> <s> the matter which she raised and very properly in her supplementary question was covered at some length the other day in our debate on these matters when i was able to record the governments concern and indeed announce a grant <e>", "<cs> my lords having regard to the number of applications received by my department and indeed others i am surprised that no grant has been made to the organisations to which my noble friend refers doubtless she will put that right <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so that is a rather profound supplementary but not an inappropriate one <e> <s> none the less it is a matter that is the subject of a good deal of research just now <e>", "<cs> my lords the department of education and science does encourage local eduation authorities to make school facilities available to the community wherever possible and there is no doubt that schools are being increasingly used in this way <e> <s> a survey conducted in for example showed that virtually all secondary schools and about two-thirds of primary schools were in use regularly in the evenings or at weekends during term time and that a substantial number were also used during the holidays <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to my noble friends first supplementary question i can say that about per cent <e> <s> of national health service expenditure goes on salaries and wages <e> <s> with regard to my noble friends second supplementary question i have to say that it would be difficult to determine that figure at least until we have a better idea of the effect of todays unfortunate action <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said the increase in expenditure in real terms since is a figure approaching per cent <e> <s> the answer to the noble lords question must therefore be that the standard of service has indeed improved <e>", "<cs> my lords if we were to meet the full demands of the health service unions i think the figure would be i am speaking from memory on this something like million or million <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we have met the demands of the health service employees in a rational way <e> <s> for example we have provided additional funds over and above those that were originally earmarked for this purpose for the nurses and midwives <e> <s> their offer as the noble lord will know is in excess of per cent <e> <s> the figure i gave for the increase in health service expenditure generally since was of course the figure which had already taken account of inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been no lack of communication between my right honourable friends and the trade union leaders in this matter but of course the question of industrial relations between the workers and the management is a matter for the health authorities themselves and is not primarily a case for ministerial intervention <e>", "<cs> my lords my recollecton is that in previous times when a pay policy of one sort or another has been in operation we have not avoided difficulties of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords it is sometimes the case that health service facilities that have been in existence for some time such as hospitals that have been built for many years do actually need to be closed but in general the aggregate result of government policy in this matter is an increase in expenditure which i described in the original answer <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend will be aware my right honourable friend the secretary of state discussed development of permanent arrangements for nurses pay with the nurses and midwives whitley council on th march <e> <s> as a result of that meeting a small working group on which both sides of the whitley council will be represented has been asked to produce more detailed proposals <e> <s> we are most anxious to move forward on this complex issue and i hope that the working group will meet shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not got that information to hand <e> <s> perhaps i could write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will know the day-to-day management of the health service rests with the regional health authorities and the district health authorities <e> <s> it is not always the case however that difficulties such as the one which the noble lord has described are the result only of lack of resources <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i could be asked to comment on that matter which of course goes pretty wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> clearly the government have no responsibility for the matter to which the noble lord refers <e>", "<cs> my lords the health service is i think inevitably a very labour-intensive operation and there are limits to the improvements in productivity which one can make by employing more technical equipment for example <e> <s> but i can say that the number of in-patients treated has increased by per cent <e> <s> betwen and while the number of nhs staff has increased by only per cent <e> <s> which is a measure of the improved efficiency of the organisation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness asks a rather different question if i may say so <e> <s> but if she is meaning that we should make greater resources available to the health service for example by acceding to the demands of the unions i would have to say that that would result in a reduction in the level of services available and not in an increase <e>", "<cs> my lords i have the figures for the total number of medical staff which i gave in my original answer <e> <s> if the noble lord will allow me i will write to him with the precise break-down of the different categories of medical staff involved <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures i gave did indeed apply to the health service in england which is of course far and away the largest of the different regions in the united kingdom <e> <s> that is not of course <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is right to point to the long-stay mental hospitals where it is true that certian difficulties do exist <e> <s> we are making a number of efforts to improve the recruitment levels for those particular hospitals and i hope that our efforts will have some success <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly look forward to the day when the number of patients treated is reduced because there is a reduction in the demand for the services of the health service <e> <s> however that is not the same as reducing the productivity of the health service which is an undesirable aim <e>", "<cs> my lords yes indeed <e> <s> i and my right honourable and honourable friends are particularly concerned to see that the monitoring of these matters continues and is indeed improved <e> <s> we have taken certain steps to that end <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have figures in front of me for the whole of the united kingdom which i understand are collected on a different basis <e> <s> but i will certainly see what additional information there is that i can pass to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is suggesting that this matter should go to arbitration i would have to disagree with him because within the context of the cash limits an increased pay offer would only mean a reduced service <e>", "<cs> my lords there is of course already existing machinery for these purposes within the health service <e> <s> it is in any event as i said a matter for the various health authorities but i am sure that any helpful suggestion from acas would be carefully considered by those bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said just now arbitration is not a practical proposition in these circumstances because as i said within the context of the cash limits <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is right to point to the lack of machinery for some of the purposes of pay determination in the public sector <e> <s> that is why the megaw inquiry for example which is looking into these matters in connection with the civil service have been asked to make proposals and why indeed my right honourable friend the secretary of state has said that we would be willing to create appropriate machinery with respect to the nurses and midwives <e>", "<cs> my lords i doubt that very many health service workers are in receipt of the benefit to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> the average earnings for example of the ancillaries is of the region of a week <e>", "<cs> my lords there is as so often if i may say so considerable merit in what the noble lord has to say but nonetheless a reasonable offer has been made through the whitley councils to these various groups of employees and we hope that they will accept them <e>", "<cs> my lords it is in fact the average earnings of a full-time male ancillary worker <e> <s> a number of other workers in the health service are of course part time <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asks that we make a special case of the nurses and midwives <e> <s> we have indeed done just that <e> <s> we have made available for that purpose extra funds some million which has resulted in the enhanced offer to the nurses and midwives through their whitley council <e> <s> as for the earlier part of the noble lords supplementary about the difficulty of conducting industrial action in the health service without affecting patient care he is quite right it really is not possible in our view to conduct industrial action in the nhs at any rate on the scale we saw last week without affecting patient care <e> <s> there was one example to which i would refer your lordships where the normal catering staff of were replaced by only five people to serve meals in a certain hospital and i fail to see how they could have provided a proper service <e>", "<cs> my lords i will see if the information the noble lord seeks is available and whether it can be provided to him and the house in a meaningful form <e> <s> i doubt whether there are very many such people <e> <s> a large number of workers in the health <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i should perhaps say tha t the great majority of nurses have not so far indulged in industrial action and that so far as i know they do not intend to do so because as i understand it the rules of the royal college of nursing preclude that although i gather that that may be a matter they are planning to consider <e> <s> as for referring the matter to acas as i said earlier there is well-established machinery in the health service namely the whitley councils for determining the pay of those who work in the health service and that is the proper method to use <e>", "<cs> my lords no central record is kept of the number of wards which may have been designated locally as stroke units <e> <s> we are however aware of growing interest in them among the professions <e> <s> the decision to set up such units is a matter for local professional and management discretion <e>", "<cs> my lords we want to provide the best facilities we can within the limits of our resources for stroke patients <e> <s> i must say however that it is not yet proved that the units to which the noble lord refers are necessarily the best way of doing it <e> <s> a number of studies have been carried out into the matter two in particular in of which i have the results with me which tend to show that in certain ways at least it is better to treat patients in the general wards of hospitals <e> <s> but the government do not have a closed mind on the matter and if further evidence becomes available or studies are made we shall be very willing to look into the matter further but in the end it is a subject for the local area health authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am of course aware that there are some stroke units already in existence which are doing an admirable job but in general as i say the case for them is not as clear-cut as some have had us imagine <e> <s> the government do not have a closed mind on the matter and if further evidence comes to light or if further experience of the existing units is more favourable we shall be happy to consider the matter further <e>", "<cs> yes my lords certainly in recent years there has been a significant increase in the number of expert therapists of different kinds available to patients and perhaps i may write to the noble baroness with the details <e> <s> there are also the stroke clubs in which i know the noble baroness has an interest <e> <s> many of them are under the auspices of the chest heart and stroke association for which my department provides financial support <e>", "<cs> my lords the point is that circumstances vary from hospital to hospital and from district to district and that is why it is better for local people to take decisions of this kind on the spot <e> <s> if i may say so the health service is not a puppet con <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i understand that hypertension and high blood pressure are an important cause of strokes and that is why research into the matter is going on i think by the medical research council again with my departments financial support <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that more research into this matter is necessary <e> <s> there might be difficulties in proceeding along the lines which the noble lord suggests of having specialists visit patients in their homes at an early stage if only because of the problem of determining when that should be <e> <s> however what the noble lord says will certainly be borne in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment and the two that follow it which have been tabled by the noble baroness and her noble friend go to the very heart of this bill <e> <s> therefore i hope that your lordships will forgive me if i deal with them at rather greater length than i would normally but i hope at not quite the same length i make no complaint of this as that of the noble baroness in introducing the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that family income supplement would continue to be payable along with statutory sick pay <e> <s> thus the fear expressed by the noble baroness is unfounded <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that generally speaking oil rigs do count as part of the united kingdom even though they might be outside territorial waters <e> <s> there is a whole plethora of special legislation relating to the conduct of affairs upon oil rigs <e> <s> in general i think the noble baroness can be assured that the workers on them are properly protected <e>", "<cs> my lords present advice issuing from the department on this point which is in circular / is that when a students educational award has been reduced because of a parental contribution his income may normally be assessed as including the full amount of the award before the reduction <e> <s> this is in line with existing supplementary benefits policy which similarly takes account of the assessed parental contribution to the grant <e> <s> the noble lord has claimed that this can cause hardship but i think that the noble lord is addressing his complaint at the wrong target <e> <s> if it is considered right within the grant system to look to the parent to make a contribution to his childs grant then that is not a fact we can ignore when considering the claim for housing assistance of the student himself <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of any category of persons who would be worse off as a result of this provision than if the change were not to be made <e> <s> it will not affect many people in total <e> <s> i have a figure of about people altogether who will be affected <e> <s> i hope the noble baroness will forgive me if i do not go into greater detail about sickness benefit and injury benefit at this moment <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of the amendment as the noble lord has explained would be to <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness will not i suspect be surprised to hear that the government cannot accept this amendment which introduces an unnecessary complication into the rules governing statutory sick pay <e> <s> as it stands at present the rule relating to entitlement to ssp during a strike is straightforward <e> <s> if an employee falls sick during a trade dispute his entitlement is to sickness benefit not to ssp <e> <s> if your lordships will pause for a moment and consider those two separate terms the difference in the circumstances will i think be apparent <e>", "<cs> my lords if this amendment were to be accepted by the house the effect would be to increase the general level of child benefit by p a week for each child in a family <e> <s> the principal aim of the proposition i presume is to produce the equivalent of a child dependency addition for statutory sick pay by increasing child benefit by the amount of the child dependency addition to sickness benefit which is currently in payment <e> <s> at the same time of course the amendment if accepted would enhance the value of child benefit which in any case is to be increased from its present level of to per child per week when the uprating becomes effective in november <e>", "<cs> my lords the second interview to which the noble lord referred in the first part of his supplementary question i would say only applies to a tiny percentage of the patients and in our view the additional staff that may be required is minimal <e> <s> i said this in my original answer <e> <s> i stand by what i have said that the number of extra staff and hence the cost of the new scheme will be very tiny <e>", "<cs> my lords in general overseas students will be regarded as visitors and therefore liable to pay the cost under this scheme but certain transitional arrangements are being agreed and these <e>", "<cs> my lords when the health service was set up in i think that was the time of the first legislation and there was subsequent legislation in it was clearly intended for the people of the united kingdom and not visitors <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that those visitors from countries with whom we have reciprocal arrangements there are a number of them will be exempt from charges <e>", "<cs> my lords students from overseas will be regarded as visitors for the purpose of this scheme but we hope that they will see fit to take out appropriate insurance to cover their medical costs <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that the noble lord is mistaken <e> <s> the act which amended the act took powers to make these charges by virtue of regulations which were authorised under the act <e> <s> those regulations have not yet been implemented but we are now doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure what figure it is that the noble lord is seeking but there are very many millions of visitors each year i think in excess of million and it is thought that these regulations would apply to the bulk of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i imagine that the cost of insuring for a year say will be of the order of <e> <s> i would not wish to minimise that amount for students who are here on grants from the british council or elsewhere but it is the case that most of those people would have to bear medical costs if they were at home anyway <e>", "<cs> my lords there will be no question of assessing the patients ability to pay before offering treatment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is partially correct <e> <s> it is true to say that the health service is generally speaking funded from the main body of taxation although there is an element from the national insurance contributions as well <e>", "<cs> no my lords quite the contrary <e> <s> all the reciprocal arrangements and there are so far as my memory serves me about will be honoured in full including the special arrangement with countries of the european community <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed i can <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount will recall that there was a working party set up to look into this matter and the new element i suppose is the report of that working party which indicates as i have said that whatever was thought previously the costs of collection are now thought to be minimal <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the government did consider such an arrangement but it was ruled out on a number of grounds not least the lack of the necessary statutory powers <e> <s> it would furthermore have required the processing of all arriving passengers at the port of entry and the issue of or million documents per annum <e> <s> the effects of such a scheme at heathrow in mid-summer for example i leave to your lordships imagination <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the case that the bulk of the visitors to this country come not from the <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept the view that visitors to this country be they students or any other have to be fed with a spoon at every step of their existence from the moment that they step ashore to the moment that they leave again <e> <s> the costs that would normally be incurred for the insurance that we have been discussing are comparatively small in connection with the total annual costs of staying in this country including the fees and i hope will not cause any significant difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not a matter for the british council it is a matter for the students themselves to decide how best to meet the costs that may fall upon them <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that british insurance companies will want to take this matter up <e> <s> i would not rule out the possibility of insurance being available at ports of entry <e> <s> the question that i was answering was on the possibility of compulsory insurance being sold at ports of entry and that presents the administrative difficulties to which i have referred <e> <s> i see no objection to slot machines at points of arrival where people could purchase appropriate insurance <e> <s> indeed i recall that when one is travelling abroad these days one can purchase insurance on departure for various purposes in any event <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i would put it round the other way <e> <s> the fact is of course that when the health service was established in this country we were the forerunners of a scheme of that kind and we had hoped that it would attract a wider following in the world at large than it in fact has <e> <s> if every country had a scheme such as ours then we could doubtless have a reciprocal arrangement with every country and this difficulty would not arise <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not describe it as a penalty <e> <s> we have certainly given very careful consideration to the position of students and the arrangements are to be as i have described <e> <s> the fact is that students or others who come to this country seeking a totally free health service are seeking access to a service which is essentially designed and paid for by the resident population <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly our health service is something of which we can be rightly proud <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that information in the form requested is not available centrally and would be disproportionately costly to collect <e> <s> capital expenditure on existing staff accommodation of all kinds amounted to million in and million in <e> <s> the importance of adequate residential accommodation for nursing staff is always recognised in any scheme to build a new hospital or to upgrade existing hospitals <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may deal first with the second part of my noble friends supplementary question this is a matter which the nurses and midwives whitley council are at present considering <e> <s> as my noble friend will recall it was decided as far back as that we should progressively increase lodging charges for nurses and we are about halfway through that process now <e> <s> thus when the charges are fully implemented which will be in i think that the question of a rent allowance will not then arise <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that schemes of this nature which are expected to cost less than million do not require specific approval by the department provided of course that they are contained within the general budget of the region or the district <e> <s> that is the reason why we do not keep detailed statistics in the way that my noble friend has asked <e> <s> there are of course regional health authorities and i think approaching district health authorities under the regions and it is for that further reason that we do not have the details which are asked for <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i am not quite certain to which joint committee the noble lord is referring <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord misunderstands the purpose and the nature of the whitley councils which are negotiating bodies with both workers and management representatives on them <e> <s> the government are not concerned in the whitley councils <e>", "<cs> my lords as i think i said in answer to the noble lord lord molloy on an earlier occasion the national health service is not a marionette controlled on strings by my right honourable friend from the elephant and castle <e> <s> we are determined to give the regions and the districts autonomy in running their own affairs and that is why we do not seek to dig up the plant and look at the roots as often as has been done on previous occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords i will choose my metaphors more carefully in future <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear what the noble lord says but that is a different question <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i am right in saying that accommodation attached to hospitals nursing homes and the like is for single people <e> <s> i will write to the noble baroness if i am wrong <e> <s> in fact the detailed guidance for these purposes is contained in hospital building note no <e> <s> of which i can perhaps send a copy to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree about the merit of the work of professor glanville who was the previous holder of this seat <e> <s> also of course i agree about the importance of rehabilitation work but l have to say that the filling of this chair is a matter for the university and not for the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that the merit of the chair in scotland is equal to that of the one in southampton when that chair is filled <e> <s> also of course i agree with my noble friend about the importance of the work carried on <e>", "<cs> my lords the filling of this chair is a matter for the authorities of the university in question <e> <s> of course it is desirable that the chair should be filled <e> <s> in fact the chair was originally endowed by the government some eight or nine years ago but it is also necessary of course that the chair should be filled by an appropriate candidate <e>", "<cs> my lords the chair was endowed by a gift from the government of some eight or nine years ago so i do not think that resources are a problem in connection with the filling of the chair itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with that <e> <s> it is also the case that the best available man is not always able or willing to take the job <e>", "<cs> my lords that depends on how long the sum of money is expected to last <e>", "<cs> rear hear <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord wallace of coslany pointed out despite the absence of his spectacles the noble lord lord banks has explained the purpose of the amendment with his usual clarity <e> <s> indeed as at least two noble lords have already said we debated the question of the level of child benefit itself at report stage <e> <s> all parties are agreed on the importance of maintaining and the desirability of improving the value of the benefit <e> <s> as i said during that debate the government have made great efforts to protect its value in difficult circumstances <e> <s> we are honouring the undertaking given in july by the then secretary of state for social services that its real value would be maintained <e> <s> this is a considerable achievement in the circumstances especially because as your lordships know child benefit is very expensive <e> <s> much as we should like to increase its value in real terms the extra resources needed are simply not available <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may intervene again with the permission of your lordships i have to say that the remaining stage after the third reading here in your lordships house tonight assuming that the bill is passed is consideration of your lordships amendments in the other place <e> <s> in that situation it is of course not open to the other place to do anything other than accept or reject our amendments or possibly offer amendments in lieu <e> <s> it is certainly not open to the other place to introduce new amendments <e>", "<cs> surprise surprise <e>", "<cs> my lords at report stage the house showed great sympathy for an amendment which drew attention to local authorities discretionary powers to disregard war disablement and war widows pensions under their local schemes <e> <s> the government have as promised put down a revised amendment to this end which my noble friend lord avon has it in mind to move shortly <e> <s> the amendment which we are now discussing would provide for a total statutory disregard of such pensions in other words the disregard would be mandatory and not discretionary and local authorities would be able to claim a per cent <e> <s> subsidy from central government towards the cost of the disregard <e>", "<cs> my lords as was announced during the committee stage in another place the ssac will be assuming responsibility for advising ministers on housing benefit <e> <s> i should not like noble lords to think that ssac will not have available the expertise to cope with the new responsibilities <e> <s> as my noble friend lord avon explained on report dhss ministers and the chairman of ssac sir arthur armitage agreed that the membership of ssac should be increased by two specifically to allow the committee to be strengthened for its new responsibilities <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e> <s> may i very briefly express my gratitude to those members of your lordships house who have taken an interest in this bill <e> <s> on a personal note may i thank noble lords for their tolerance of me as a new boy to social security <e> <s> it is a major bill <e> <s> it recasts the arrangements for income maintenance during sickness and rationalises the provision of help to people on low incomes with their rent and rates <e> <s> as with most social security legislation there has been much technical material in the bill but despite this there has been a loyal band of your lordships taking part in the debates and i particularly welcome the constructive approach of the noble baroness lady jeger and her colleagues on the opposition front bench <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i again thank all noble lords for their participation in the debates on this bill <e> <s> i am sorry that i have not been able to persuade all of your lordships to the views that i advanced <e> <s> i fear that that was hardly to be expected <e> <s> may i just make one point <e> <s> the noble baroness lady jeger complained that unusually this is a benefit which is related to wages <e> <s> but it is not a benefit that we are introducing it is an extension of occupational sick pay <e> <s> i would not wish your lordships to go away with any thought that that was the governments view although i understand that the noble baroness may wish to disagree <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord lord molloy that the government have no intention of trying to humiliate anybody <e> <s> we have made the very best offer that we can in the circumstances <e> <s> we have recognised the very special position of nurses and midwives by giving them a rather larger offer than it is possible to give to other workers and also by declaring our determination to establish permanent machinery for determining nurses pay in future <e>", "<cs> my lords the tsrb covers a very small number of senior staff <e> <s> its recommendations are for catching up awards from recommended levels which could perhaps be analogous to the clegg awards of <e> <s> even after the recent tsrb award the pay of those persons affected is at the very most only i per cent <e> <s> above the level recommended for st april <e> <s> since then nhs staff have received increases nearer to per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords while my noble friend lord morris might be right there have of course been a good many other changes since that time as well <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should make it clear that mr lowry has not been asked to solve this problem but rather to act as a line of communication in this matter between the government and the tuc to see whether he can determine what common ground may exist <e> <s> the other matter which the noble lord raised is of course an important one too <e>", "<cs> my lords the government certainly agree that the nurses occupy a very special place in the national health service <e> <s> that is why we have offered rather more to the nurses on this occasion than we have to other workers in the same service and why we have agreed to establish the special negotiating machinery to which i referred earlier <e> <s> we hope that these special considerations will weigh with the other members of the service as well <e>", "<cs> my lords only about per cent <e> <s> of nurses in the health service actually live in accommodation provided within the health service <e> <s> quite a wide range of nurses student nurses pupils and others enjoy discounts from the accommodation charges and indeed those who live in substandard accommodation also have discounts <e> <s> furthermore the charges are being introduced on a progressive basis and will not be fully in place until <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already said the government certainly accept that the nurses deserve and indeed have received special consideration in this matter that is why we have made the provision to which i have already referred <e> <s> but at the end of the day the cost of the health service can only be within what we can afford and that is why arbitration for example is not a possibility open to us because it is for the government to decide what the nation can afford in the circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to say that arbitration is not a possibility in these circumstances <e> <s> the government have through the whitley council made the best offer that can be made within the limits of the resources available <e> <s> the noble lord is quite right that if a larger offer had been made it would have had to come from within existing funds available to the health service <e>", "<cs> my lords in any situation of free bargaining the employer whoever he may be whether the government or some private company has to decide the maximum sum he can afford in terms of wage increases <e> <s> that is what is going on now <e> <s> we have decided the maximum sum that is available for this purpose <e> <s> arbitration would only threaten that <e>", "<cs> my lords the act to which my noble friend refers was a consolidation measure which consolidated a number of provisions including provisions which over the years had been enacted in various finance acts <e> <s> there are a number of precedents for measures such as this to be included in finance acts including for example schedule to the act <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a perfectly respectable point of view but the fact is that a number of provisions of this nature including administrative matters relating to customs and excise have down the ages been included in finance acts <e> <s> this is by no means the first case <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that this is not a matter for me <e> <s> however it is certainly the case that these arrangements are of long standing <e> <s> perhaps therefore it is a matter which if it were thought appropriate could be taken up in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect it is a matter for the speaker in another place who attaches a certificate to the finance act that it is a money bill and is therefore subject to the various provisions of the parliament act <e>", "<cs> my lords the department of health does not specifically monitor the prices opticians charge for private optical services but is aware from evidence in the professional journals that in some practices the prices of private frames have been reduced by as much as per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend will know there have been discussions recently between my department and the opticians with regard to certain underpayments which have been made in recent years and in one small area a certain overpayment as well <e> <s> the underpayment amounted altogether to some million <e> <s> we hope that these discussions will be concluded by the end of this summer and that new charges will thereafter be authorised in respect of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the director general expects to publish his report before the end of this year <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so this is a new departure for the director-general of fair trading <e> <s> as my noble friend will be aware the supply of spectacles is a statutory monopoly that is to say it can be conducted only by those who are registered with the opticians council <e> <s> for that reason the director-general of fair trading has had to approach this matter in a rather different way from his approach to some other inquiries <e> <s> this is one of the reasons why it has taken as long as it has <e> <s> however i am not certain that the dramatic results that my noble friend anticipates from the director-generals report will materialise in practice <e>", "<cs> my lords doubtless the noble baroness is correct in her quotations from the education act <e> <s> but the question of whether vat should or should not be charged of course stems from the provisions of the finance act <e> <s> in essence these are that vat should be charged only where the courses are run for a financial profit or where they are for sporting or recreational activities <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been no change of action as the noble baroness puts it <e> <s> the situation has not changed since the statutory provision was first made in <e> <s> what has happened recently <e>", "<cs> my lords what is important is that courses operated by what i might call the private sector which have for long been subjected to tax because of course they are more generally operated for commercial reasons should be treated in the same way as the local authority courses or any other public body courses operated on the same basis and that is what is now happening <e>", "<cs> my lords courses of the sort that we are discussing are not those which the authorities are statutorily bound to provide <e> <s> for example they include a course on witchcraft which i do not think can be regarded as a statutory requirement <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so that is not quite correct the position is not quite so simple as that <e> <s> it is that where courses of a sporting or recreational nature are provided by the local authority they are in general excluded from the exemption and again where courses are operated on a commercial basis they are excluded from the exemption <e> <s> but on the other hand where courses are included as part of a wider educational course for example by a university or a school then they attract exemption <e>", "<cs> my lords the list of those courses that might be regarded as recreational and therefore not exempt from vat could of course be a very long one <e> <s> but in addition to witchcraft yoga and ballroom dancing are possibilities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble baroness lady david feels so strongly about this matter but as i say the circumstances have prevailed since including the years to for which she and her honourable and right honourable colleagues had responsibility for these matters <e> <s> nothing has changed in that time <e> <s> if the noble baroness and her friends thought that there was a problem then they could have changed it <e>", "<cs> my lords i did explain that the list could be and indeed doubtless is a very long one <e> <s> of course in the end if anyone wishes to challenge the suggestion that his course is or is not of a recreational or sporting nature i suppose it is open to him to go to the courts to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords that depends which government <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said just now i presume that it is open to anyone who thinks that he is being treated other than in accordance with the law to challenge the fact at court <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier what has happened recently is that some local authorities have chosen to withdraw the subsidy for some of the courses that they offer <e> <s> they are now in direct competition with organisations in the private sector which in many cases also offer similar courses on which they have to charge vat and the customs rightly in my view think that in those circumstances local authorities ought also to charge vat <e>", "<cs> my lords i and my right honourable and honourable friends in the department of health lose no opportunity of making the figures public not least in answer to questions from the noble baroness and members of the other place <e> <s> i am not sure what more there is that we could do in present circumstances but certainly i hope that the importance of the figures that i have mentioned is not lost on those who are now contemplating industrial action of one sort or another <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that the noble lord is wholly right on that <e> <s> no doubt the bill that he sought to introduce all those years ago was right and proper at the time but today for example an enrolled nurse earns a staff nurse a ward sisters pay is approaching and a nursing officer grade i earns and that is before any offer in respect of is added on <e> <s> so the picture is not necessarily as black as the noble lord paints it <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not doubt that much of the work which nurses do is difficult and very often they work very long hours indeed <e> <s> but on the other hand the work is very satisfying perhaps more so than the work done by the kind of secretary whom the noble baroness has described <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the government certainly recognise that nurses are a special case even within the health service <e> <s> that is why the offer that we made included special provision for the nurses and that is why we made additional funds available for the purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that i do not speak from experience of that kind but i am sure that the noble lord is right <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect arbitration has one drawback and that is that it does not say where any additional money is to come from <e> <s> it is for the government surely to decide how much money is available for the purpose <e> <s> that is what we have done and that is what the offer incorporated <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very sorry to have to say that during the last day of action as it was called emergency care was not maintained right across the country in particular with regard to the ambulance services in some areas and therefore special arrangements had to be made <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i do not have in front of me the figures for every single area of british industry but the noble lord recently asked me about the tsrb report and on that occasion i was able to tell him if he recalls that members working in the health service have i think enjoyed a per cent <e> <s> increase since and are now therefore paid in the order of that percentage above levels while those to whom the tsrb award applied are still paid only about per cent <e> <s> above the levels of that year <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a good deal of force in what the noble lord says but i fear the fact remains that we have to find the money from somewhere <e> <s> the health service employs altogether about a million people about half of whom are nurses and so your lordships will appreciate that even a modest increase costs a very great deal of money overall <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i will now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for employment <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to both noble lords for their halfhearted welcome to the proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords i misinterpreted the noble lord opposite and i apologise <e> <s> as for the resources available to the scheme i think it is important to recognise that the total resources available remain unchanged <e> <s> it is simply that <e> <s> in general employers will be making a greater contribution to the training programmes and thus it has been possible to raise the allowance to individual trainees <e> <s> but that is within the context i would emphasise this of the unchanged resources for the scheme as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord for that response <e> <s> could i just make two points <e> <s> the noble lord asked about the rate of which as i said is regarded now as appropriate for september but we have said that we are prepared to keep an open mind on this and maybe review the figure between now and then <e> <s> on the withdrawal of benefit for six weeks in the event of unreasonable refusal to participate in a course that would apply to both -year-olds and -year-olds <e> <s> on the final point the noble lord made about the conditions to be completed before the scheme comes into force i would like to consider the implication of that question before giving the blanket assurance that the noble lord asks for and if necessary perhaps i could write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not able to say off-hand what assistance the social fund is giving to other members of the community for similar schemes <e> <s> can say so far as we are concerned that we are receiving some million or did receive some million in in respect of our own yop scheme which is of course subsumed into this new scheme <e> <s> we would hope that we could get a little more for the coming year but it is too early to say precisely how much more that will be <e> <s> it is of course fairly simple arithmetic to determine what percentage of the total cost that contribution is <e> <s> but it is very welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is of course a doughty champion of the co-operative movement <e> <s> i confess that i have not always gone all the way with him on some of his ideas in that connection but in regard to the scheme he has described i must confess i do not have immediate knowledge of that scheme it sounds a very imaginative one and certainly appears to deserve support <e> <s> on the general point of finding jobs for those who complete their course i can say that about half or perhaps more than half of the trainees who complete courses do manage to find jobs at the end of that or soon after <e> <s> i am looking forward to the day when more than that number will do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is not correct <e> <s> in this particular context to be specific the revisions which we have made to the training scheme were literally a change of emphasis because they were a reordering of existing resources it was not possible to make available additional resources <e> <s> with regard to the supplementary benefit question the second part of the proposals i have announced we are saying that although we are not going to withdraw supplementary <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord says the select committee of which the noble lord was i think a distinguished member recognised that the youth training scheme represented in their words <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord lord wallace of coslany was not able more <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl had a distinguished role to play in these affairs in years past but whatever negotiating machinery is devised somebody has to find the money to meet these wage settlements <e> <s> if we were to give teeth to the whitley councils and for example were to give them a total say over how much money they have to dispose of that would be in effect an open-ended commitment and the government cannot enter into an open-ended commitment <e> <s> we have a clear and binding duty to control public expenditure one way or another and to give particularly health service pay negotiators an open-ended ability to conduct their negotiations would be a wholly unacceptable imposition on the public purse <e>", "<cs> my lords the distinction between the award to the teachers and the civil servants on the one hand and to the health service workers on the other hand is that in the first two cases the awards were contained within existing cash limits of around per cent <e> <s> it has not been possible to do that with regard to the health service award <e> <s> it is perhaps worth mentioning that the health service altogether employs something like a million people <e> <s> your lordships will appreciate therefore that a very tiny percentage increase can mean a very substantial sum altogether in public expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords it is of course the case that the health service unions are already taking industrial action and have been for some considerable time while the nurses are not doing so have not done so and so far as we know will not do so <e> <s> it is thus hardly surprising that if there is any difficulty my right honourable friend is anxious about the health service unions who have already taken industrial action <e> <s> indeed as i said in answer to the noble baroness lady lane-fox the other day even emergency cover has in some places been withdrawn <e> <s> however it is the intention of my right honourable friend to get a settlement in this matter and that is why he has made the additional funds available to which i have referred today <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the government can abandon responsibility for determining the sums of money available for these matters <e> <s> we have long said that it is necessary to contain the growth in public expenditure and we have therefore to contain the growth in funds available to the health service <e> <s> that is why my right honourable friend has to set the total sums available to the whitley councils for the negotiations in respect of their different grades <e> <s> within those total sums it is of course open to the whitley councils to allocate the money as best they can and as they think fit after discussion between the management and staff sides <e>", "<cs> my lords i must join other noble lords who have thanked the noble baroness lady lane-fox for introducing this short debate this evening because it gives me the chance to welcome the report prepared by the multiple sclerosis society on benefits for partial disability <e> <s> the report has understandably generated much interest in the continuing debate on the need for provision for those who are unable to work full-time because of disability or chronic illness <e> <s> it has also made some useful suggestions on how such help could be given <e>", "<cs> my lords i too have seen the report of that matter and i and my colleagues have asked for some advice and information about that particular case <e> <s> i must agree that it appears to be something that needs to be looked into <e>", "<cs> doctors and nurses are trained in this country primarily to meet the needs of patients in this country where the practices referred to by the noble lord are deprecated unless performed for purely medical reasons <e> <s> for doctors and nurses going overseas who require training specifically related to these practices it would have to be arranged specially <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have that figure immediately in front of me but i understand that the increases to which i referred ran ahead of the increases in population <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that at a time such as now when the waiting lists are unhappily lengthening largely as a result of industrial action there is a degree of unsatisfied demand though i am not sure i am in a position precisely to measure that <e>", "<cs> my lords it is of course the case that the number of nurses has also increased during that time <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to agree with my noble friend that the question of whether or not a patient is an emergency case is a matter for the medical <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the case that in the past there has been some anxiety that some areas of the country have not been given an appropriate allocation of resources in regard to health service development <e> <s> that is why some years ago a body called the resource allocations working party was devised <e> <s> it is the recommendations of that working party which are now incorporated into the annual plans for expenditure in various regions <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said the number of nurses has in fact increased over that period but the additional number of patients being treated is also accounted for by the fact that they actually stay in the hospital beds for a shorter time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure whether i quite follow the implications of the noble lords question which is a fairly wide one if i may say so but he will be well aware of our attitude to the current pay position which i dealt with in some detail yesterday <e>", "<cs> on the contrary we have taken into account the views of those who would be concerned as the noble lord describes <e> <s> that is why my noble friend lord elton tabled amendment no <e> <s> which we shall come to in a moment and which i shall move with your lordships permission on behalf of my noble friend which specifically requires that the views of these people be taken into account at the moment when they are most valuable <e>", "<cs> without looking at all the correspondence which i cannot do in a second i am not quite certain when it was that this amendment <e>", "<cs> it may be of assistance to your lordships if i say that my noble friend lord elton will have something more to say on that matter when we come to clause stand apart <e>", "<cs> i should not wish to delay your lordships any longer <e> <s> i think the noble lord lord elystan-morgan will have appreciated that this amendment seems to command a good deal of support <e> <s> may i just say that in the old days i suppose it was occasionally possible for the courts to impose conditions on supervision orders which were difficult in respect of compliance <e> <s> i believe we have gone a long way towards eliminating that <e> <s> i am sure no court has deliberately done that but it may have happened inadvertently from time to time <e> <s> i believe we have gone a long way seeing that that does not happen in the future <e>", "<cs> i certainly accept that this is a serious and thoughtful amendment which deserves our proper consideration <e> <s> its purpose which is to strengthen the confidence of the courts in the supervision order as an alternative to custody is entirely in accord with the governments policy <e> <s> indeed i am aware that the amendment commands influential support outside your lordships house <e> <s> i am afraid i feel therefore something of a killjoy in asking your lordships to consider some of the difficulties involved in this amendment although i am reinforced in the view that some of those will have occurred already to the noble baroness lady birk and indeed to my noble friend lord digby <e>", "<cs> i think that varies <e> <s> i am speaking from memory here but i think he could go either to a borstal of some sort or to a detention centre <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i shall now repeat a statement being made by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for industry in the other place <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord ponsonby for the solitary cheer he was able to give to the statement which was broadly reflected in the remarks of the noble baroness lady seear for which i also thank her <e> <s> as for the rationale behind the proposals which i think was at the heart of what lord ponsonby was saying as i made clear in the statement the assisted areas are really too large presently to be effective <e> <s> moreover there are places outside the areas which reasonably feel they are being treated unfairly by the present arrangements which they consider to be anomalous which was also the point made by lady seear <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for wales intends to reply to a question for written answer in this connection <e> <s> i think that it is to be today but it is certainly to be in the very near future <e>", "<cs> my lords what i have announced today has some relevance to scotland <e> <s> to some extent there are separate arrangements for wales to which i have already referred and certainly the arrangements for northern ireland are entirely different <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no secret on the matter or there would not be if i could find the relevant piece of paperhowever as i say it is a fact that my right honourable friend intends to reply to a question for written answer and i can tell the noble lord and the house that he will be describing the arrangements that are to be made for mid-wales which are actually made under different legislative provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords i have in front of me what i think is a draft on the written answer that my right honourable friend intends to provide <e> <s> if my noble friend would care to table a suitable question for written answer i should be happy to answer it today if possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i am of course aware of the anxieties about mid-wales which the noble lord has expressed <e> <s> the announcement that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for wales will be making will i think go a very long way towards allaying the anxiety <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that the spread of unemployment is not even throughout the areas <e> <s> the statement that i have repeated this afternoon related to the assisted areas in general and not to <e>", "<cs> the government are of course aware of the concern expressed by the parliamentary all-party penal affairs group and others which underlies this amendment <e> <s> we are firmly of the view that the care order should remain available to courts dealing with juveniles in criminal proceedings <e> <s> it is necessary in order to help the courts to deal with difficult offenders without having to resort to custody <e> <s> the courts are already criticised for imposing custodial sentences on young offenders too readily <e> <s> the care order must be retained as a substantial alternative <e> <s> that there may well be room for better practice is one thing <e> <s> it is another to conclude that there should be legislative restraint <e> <s> and one must not exaggerate <e> <s> in the latest year for which we have statistics fewer than juvenile offenders were made subject to a care order to be precise <e> <s> that is really a very small proportion of the total number of juveniles found guilty in the courts in which was <e> <s> its use has moreover declined in recent years while the use of custody has increased <e> <s> we must beware of further discouraging its use in proper cases <e>", "<cs> as always i come to these occasions with an open mind and a flexible approach <e> <s> i am impressed by the weight of opinion which i have heard this afternoon in connection with the amendment <e> <s> there could perhaps be a case for introducing into the bill some indication of the nature of the circumstances in which orders of this kind should be made <e> <s> therefore i am willing to give an undertaking that both i and my right honourable friends will consider the matter with a view to bringing forward an amendment for that purpose at the next stage of the bill <e> <s> in the light of that undertaking i hope my noble friend will see fit to withdraw her amendment <e>", "<cs> if i may first answer my noble friend lady macleod of borve i understand that foster parents would indeed be covered by the proposal in the amendment <e> <s> in answer to my noble friend lady masham of ilton the present position is as she described it that is of course the concern of my noble friend lady faithful <e> <s> but the concern which underlines the amendment is one that the government share <e> <s> a care order made in criminal proceedings is undoubtedly a very serious sentence and one that should not be made when any less substantial form of intervention in a juveniles life would suffice <e>", "<cs> i want to say right away of course that i understand the anxiety which underlies this amendment <e> <s> i think that it is part of the wider debate which is developing about the philosophy of the children and young persons act and its approach to children in trouble <e> <s> the amendment goes to the heart of the framework of that act <e> <s> that is something which the government have sought to avoid doing <e> <s> as recently as the magistrates associa <e>", "<cs> i find myself happily in sympathy with the intention behind this amendment <e> <s> indeed we would go further <e> <s> the government consider that the cases of all children in care not only those in care as a result of criminal proceedings under section of the act should be subject to review and indeed section of the child care act already requires local authorities to review the case of each child in their care at intervals of not more than six months <e> <s> this clause is concerned with imposing a duty on the secretary of state to make regulations <e> <s> section of the act already enables the secretary of state to make regulations regarding the procedure of reviews <e> <s> this clause would therefore to a large extent duplicate existing provision <e>", "<cs> may i make just one observation which i hope will assist my noble friend lord onslow <e> <s> a care order is not a custodial sentence <e> <s> a child who is in care and who happens to be placed in a residential home for example or who is in foster care or even in his own home is not under a legal constraint <e> <s> of course if a child of a later age is sent to a borstal home that is something different <e> <s> he is then in some form of legal custody <e>", "<cs> of course that would be a breach of the terms of the care order and suitable disciplinary procedures would then no doubt be applied <e> <s> but a care order is different from a custodial sentence <e> <s> a care order can be terminated at any time more or less during its course by application to the court which originally made the order <e> <s> indeed care orders are reviewed as i have said on a regular basis <e> <s> your lordships were saying in the context of amendment no <e> <s> that you thought the review should be carried out by the juvenile court <e> <s> that was something that i thought it necessary to resist but i am much less resistant to the proposals in this amendment which in principle we have accepted <e> <s> indeed in practice the concerns expressed in connection with the amendment are already met by what happens in the reviews by local authorities to which i have referred already <e> <s> the sort of anxieties expressed by my noble friend lord onslow went very wide of what happens in practice <e> <s> if my noble friend was right in saying that children were being locked up from the age of to the age of without any review that would be a different matter but that is far from being the position in practice <e>", "<cs> no with respect i do not think i would agree with that <e> <s> the order is for the child to live under the care of the local authority and that is a very different matter <e> <s> the local authorities have wide discretion as to where that child should live whether in a residential home with foster parents or indeed in the childs own home <e> <s> i think that is a very different thing from a custodial sentence <e> <s> a care order is most certainly not a custodial sentence and i hope your lordships will not be misled into thinking that it is <e>", "<cs> i wanted to indicate the wide range of possibilities that are available to the local authority in respect of their responsibilities under a care order which we are considering <e> <s> indeed i imagine it is the case that a particular child for whom a care order is made might spend time in all three of the various situations that i have referred to <e> <s> i believe that we are considering something very different from a custodial sentence and i also think that the judicial review which is effectively what is proposed by the earlier amendment is not appropriate <e> <s> i agree that some less formal review is desirable <e> <s> that is why we have accepted the principle of this amendment and why indeed in practice as i have said reviews of one sort or another take place on a regular basis <e>", "<cs> this new clause seeks to do something which the government are already committed to trying to achieve <e> <s> we are therefore wholly in sympathy with the intention behind it which is to bring to an end the remand to prison of juveniles who are certified as being so unruly that they cannot safely be committed to the care of a local authority <e> <s> this is a somewhat emotive subject <e> <s> it was given a full debate on an identical amendment in another place and your lordships here have spoken eloquently about it this evening <e> <s> but i am afraid that the government cannot accept this new clause <e> <s> my right honourable friend the home secretary already has power under section of the children and young persons act to make orders amending the remand provisions <e> <s> the power was last exercised last march when -year-old boys were excluded from this provision <e> <s> it now applies only to boys aged and <e> <s> we are already looking to see what can be done about that age group <e> <s> this new clause would make an abrupt change in an area where we need to move very carefully and to try to carry with us the confidence both of the courts and of the local authorities <e> <s> i should therefore like to try briefly to explain the difficulties <e>", "<cs> yes most certainly <e>", "<cs> the words in the long run were the words of my noble friend <e> <s> they were not my words <e>", "<cs> i should have been willing to go further if my noble friend had asked me <e>", "<cs> i cannot i am afraid give a specific date as to when this happy state of affairs will arrive <e> <s> certainly i agree that it is a most desirable objective <e> <s> in recent months we have made significant progress <e> <s> indeed since the written answer which i provided to my noble friend lady faithfull we have been able to <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble baroness lady david but it would be helpful if she will give me more of a clue as to the figures she is talking about <e>", "<cs> which unhappily is not me <e>", "<cs> i am sympathetic i must say to the underlying intentions of this amendment <e> <s> the position of children in care who are admitted to secure accommodation is at present the subject of <e>", "<cs> i am not aware of any review failing to take place which should take place <e> <s> if the noble baroness or my noble friend lady faithfull know of a specific instance where a review required under the regulations or under some other provision should have taken place but did not take place i would most certainly want to know about it and i would certainly be anxious to look into it and find out what did or did not happen <e> <s> however i think that the genreal position leaving aside the question of the european convention on human rights which as i have said is something we really need to look into <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that there are two separate issues on which i need to satisfy your lordships this evening in connection with this amendment <e> <s> the first is the general question of the regulations at present in force as to their suitability and as to their merit <e> <s> the second is the narrower point of whether or not the present arrangements enable us to comply with our obligations under the european convention on human rights <e>", "<cs> i think that we are dealing with two different matters here <e> <s> the noble lord referred to the mental health case <e> <s> it is the case that legislation currently before parliament in fact the mental health amendment bill which i believe started in your lordships house and which in any event is now in the other place makes certain provision with respect to appeals to mental health tribunals which is of course a separate matter <e> <s> that of course relates to detentions under the mental health acts which is not specifically <e>", "<cs> i accept that the principles are very likely similar but they may well not be identical and are certainly arrived at under different statutory provisions <e> <s> in any event this matter which comes under this particular legislation is i understand currently before the law officers and doubtless they will be letting us have the benefit of their advice in the very near future <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord will give way <e> <s> may i amplify what i said about the law officers <e> <s> the matter is now before the law officers whatever may have been the delays previously and i hope therefore that their advice will be available very shortly <e>", "<cs> i am not sure whether the noble lord lord donaldson has anything further to say <e>", "<cs> i will deploy my arguments now in full if i may and the noble lord can then intervene again if he thinks fit <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will contain himself for a moment i will come to the points he is making <e> <s> the intention is that new regulations will be laid before parliament during the next session <e> <s> clause in its present form includes general criteria but we accept that these criteria will need to be refined particularly in relation to absconding <e> <s> on the one hand we do not wish the words likely to abscond to become a catch-all phrase which is capable of application to almost any child <e> <s> on the other hand we do not wish children whose placement in security is genuinely indicated for example those who are remanded to care to be excluded <e> <s> the wording of the revised regulations will be looked at very carefully and i can assure your lordships that what has been said tonight will be taken into account but we see the refinement as being a matter for consideration during the course of the preparation of the revised regulations rather than as a matter for primary legislation <e> <s> the noble lord has raised a proper and important point but i hope that on reflection he will think that the adjustment of the regulations i have referred to is the better way of meeting his anxiety <e> <s> i therefore hope that he will not press his amendment <e>", "<cs> as i said earlier i always come to the proceedings of this chamber with an open mind and not shackled to the pieces of paper i have in front of me <e> <s> as far as this particular amendment is concerned i realise that the noble lord lord donaldson feels very strongly indeed about it <e> <s> i must say that i remain convinced that the arguments which i sought to deploy to your lordships carried considerable force <e> <s> i am prepared to take the matter away and think about it again without commitment i must say because i see some difficulties which i have already deployed to your lordships and if the noble lord will withdraw the amendment i undertake that the matter will be considered carefully between now and the next stage and we can perhaps return to it on that occasion <e>", "<cs> this amendment would enable my right honourable friend to include in regulations governing the conduct of community homes a requirement to establish boards of visitors <e> <s> the intention underlying this amendment which is to ensure that community homes are properly monitored is one which the government strongly support <e> <s> i am confident however that adequate provisions already exist to ensure the effective monitoring of community homes <e> <s> section of the child care act enables the secretary of state for social services to make regulations governing the conduct of community homes which specify requirements for securing the welfare of children in community homes <e> <s> the current regulations are the community homes regulations <e> <s> these regulations are now being revised and it is our intention to lay fresh regulations in the next parliamentary session <e> <s> in addition section of the child care act makes provision for the inspection of community homes <e> <s> inspections are carried out by the social work services of the department of health and social security <e>", "<cs> i understand every community home has a board of governors <e> <s> there are of course different types of community homes <e> <s> there are maintained homes controlled homes and assisted homes in all of which the local authority plays a greater or lesser role <e> <s> the answer to the first question of the noble baroness is yes <e>", "<cs> i am advised that every community home has a hoard of governors of one sort or another <e> <s> i hear what my noble friend says about certain homes within his own purview <e> <s> i would not wish to offer a specific view on the particular homes to which he refers <e> <s> it may be that the board of governors are less active in certain cases than they are in others <e>", "<cs> i have already spoken at some length on this point and i gave quite clear undertakings <e> <s> i cannot go further than the undertakings which i gave then <e> <s> if the noble lord will study tomorrow morning in <e>", "<cs> this is one of the most complex and sensitive provisions of the bill <e> <s> our aim is to clarify and simplify the existing law which provides in section of the children and young persons act that the courts must in the case of a child and may in the case of a young person order that any fines costs or compensation awarded against him be paid by the parents unless they cannot be found or the court is satisfied that they have not conduced to the commission of the offence by failure to exercise due care and control <e> <s> we replaced this <e>", "<cs> my lords later in my speech i was going to say more about the statistics point <e> <s> perhaps i could make further reference to it now since my noble friend has intervened <e> <s> our view is that the proposals for determining these areas of eligibility and the nature of the statistics used are not particularly satisfactory <e> <s> we have considerable doubts for example about calculating regional gdps <e> <s> frankly national gdps are difficult enough to calculate accurately <e> <s> if you try to calculate regional gdps it is even more difficult particularly so if one wants the figures to be as up to date as possible <e> <s> certainly we accept some of the criticisms which have been made about figures <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend said the bill incorporates some of the nacro points she raised <e> <s> i hope she will forgive me if i say that it might unduly detain the committee if i gave a long disposition on the views of the government on other nacro recommendations <e> <s> i am certainly willing to write to my noble friend and will see that that happens before the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> so far as i know in the main the rationale is inflation only <e> <s> perhaps i can inquire into the question of whether there is any further rationale and let the noble and learned lord know <e>", "<cs> against such an onslaught what can i do other than accept the amendment <e> <s> i am happy to do so <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> at the risk of incurring the displeasure of the noble lord lord melchett whose interests in this matter are well known i would say <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may preface my brief remarks by making it clear to your lordships that clause as it now stands in the bill resulted from an exception we agreed in another place to make to the bills general provisions on fines in the light of representations made to ministers by the national farmers union and the association of county councils <e> <s> we are now asked to go even further and i make no complaint about that <e> <s> i merely wish the committee to know that clause was inserted in the bill in response to the anxieties of those concerned who wish to see more effective control exercised in the burning of straw and stubble <e> <s> the burning of straw and stubble is a necessary and indeed desirable activity in the interests of good husbandry but we must encourage more effective control <e> <s> as regards the proposal that the maxi <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may address myself to the question of the penalties which is the thrust of the amendments of the noble lord lord monson and his colleagues <e> <s> i would remind your lordships that we are dealing here with offences made under by-laws for good rule and government which local authorities are empowered to make under section of the local government act <e> <s> such by-laws are of course intended generally to deal with relatively minor local regulatory matters and the general maximum fine for the offences they contain is accordingly <e> <s> an exception was made in relation to certain by-laws by the criminal law act and the maximum fine for straw and stubble burning was thereby increased to <e> <s> that was to reflect the particular problems created by uncontrolled burning <e> <s> we have agreed to make a further exception by increasing the maximum available to which is the next step on the standard scale of fines established by clause of the bill <e> <s> amendment a and its consequential a now seek to double that figure by taking it to the top step of the scale <e>", "<cs> with respect to my noble friend i did recite some of the difficulties over the amendment which had occurred to me <e> <s> i am not sure whether my noble friend was in his place at that time <e>", "<cs> having said that i do not want to appear to be inflexible <e> <s> i have given an undertaking that we shall introduce amendments at the next stage with a view to increasing the penalty to <e> <s> in the light of the views which have been expressed this evening i shall consider the matter further to see whether there is any more that we can do <e> <s> however i do not wish to give to your lordships a categoric undertaking that we can do so <e>", "<cs> while the government have a certain amount of sympathy for the arguments put forward in connection with this amendment i fear that we cannot accept it <e> <s> it is important to remember that we are dealing with a penalty for a breach of a by-law <e> <s> as your lordships will know by-law offences are at the bottom of the scale of offences and the simple penalties for their contravention are correspondingly low <e> <s> the great majority attract a maximum fine of or less <e> <s> in some cases where public health or safety are involved and the noble lord lord melchett referred to these earlier a fine of up to may be imposed and the government accept that the straw and stubble burning by-law which may be made under section of the local government act requires a relatively high penalty <e> <s> but i know of no by-law which carries a penalty of disqualification <e> <s> must say that i am not persuaded of the need in this case <e>", "<cs> that is if i may say so rather a different matter but if the noble lord will allow me to finish perhaps he will take a different view <e> <s> as i said that is why it is controlled on a local basis by means of by-laws <e> <s> but by-laws are a peculiar form of instrument they are normally valid only if among other things they are impartial and treat everyone equally <e> <s> so the current by-law creates a general ban on straw and stubble burning except where certain conditions are met <e> <s> turning this about the effect is that anyone may burn so long as they meet those conditions <e> <s> the effect of the amendment would be to disqualify certain people from burning straw and stubble even if in future they were to meet every single condition imposed <e>", "<cs> i find myself in an unusual position for a government spokesman in this parliament namely in agreement with an amendment to which the noble lord lord avebury has attached his name <e> <s> as the noble lord suggests there may not have been many previous occasions upon which that was so <e> <s> the government accept this amendment in principle <e> <s> i therefore propose that the government should bring forward an amendment on report to deal specifically with the provision of social inquiry reports in the case of adult offenders who have not previously served a sentence of imprisonment <e> <s> like this amendment it will retain discretion for the court to dispense with a report where one is manifestly unnecessary <e> <s> on that understanding i hope the noble baroness will not press the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that one needs to distinguish in ones mind between what may have been the merits or demerits of going off the gold standard many years ago and going back on it again now <e> <s> whatever may have been the position in former times i think that the difficulties of going back to a fixed price for gold for example now are very formidable indeed and not to be lightly dismissed <e> <s> there have recently been a number of inquiries into the possibility not least one by the united states gold commission which the noble lord may have seen and clearly the arguments are still very sharply against going back onto the gold standard <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord boothby is of course a great expert in these matters and has consistently advanced the view which is reflected in his question today <e> <s> but i must say that circumstances in regard to the international monetary system are now very different indeed from those of or even years ago <e> <s> i think that the new approach towards a multi-currency international reserves system is better <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that the bretton woods system served quite well perhaps rather than very well from when i think it was first established to or thereabouts when it was discontinued <e> <s> the matter of course arises at conferences of every kind from time to time as it did not least at the versailles summit quite recently when the heads of state addressed their minds to this matter and made some reference to it in the communiqu <e> <s> but the fact remains that circumstances have changed very much since and we need to move forward <e> <s> i think that the approach of the imf and the development of the special drawing rights in other words a general approach towards a multi-currency system of international reserves is much better suited to the second half of the th century <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that it is in the gift of any single nation even the united states to take one single step that will lift us all out of the international recession <e> <s> we need a steady and steadfast if that is the right word economic policy by all the major trading nations of the world including the united states the united kingdom france federal germany and the rest so that together we can improve the trading situation of the world <e> <s> as regards the united kingdom that is what we are seeking to do <e>", "<cs> my lords the brandt commission report was of course a very wide-ranging document but it is perhaps worth remembering that in the united kingdom we spend something in excess of billion a year on retirement pensions and other benefits for elderly people and we have a record of which i think we can be proud <e>", "<cs> my lords if that report were correct it would indeed be discouraging but i would advise the noble lord not to believe anything he reads in the newspapers <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that it is an important feature of our policy to get all people who are unsuitably accommodated in hospitals into community homes of every kind whether they are handicapped people elderly people or infirm people in some other way <e> <s> we have an order of priority in that regard <e> <s> we are particularly concerned at the present time with mentally handicapped people and wish to get them out of long-stay hospitals <e> <s> i certainly agree that the other categories of people who are inappropriately housed in that way ought to be seen to and we shall do so just as soon as resources permit <e>", "<cs> my lords policy statements will be made in due time <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i agree with that <e> <s> the voluntary agencies certainly play a very important role in this matter and indeed we provide help from central government sources to quite a number of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i have never regarded the noble lord as helpless but then he might like to go to the conference himself <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i think that the noble lord slightly misunderstood the answer <e> <s> perhaps i did not make it sufficiently clear <e> <s> the two matters to which he referred are things which we shall be doing in this country to mark the convention in vienna but what actually happens at the convention is different <e> <s> it will be a forum for discussion <e> <s> there will be a number of major proposals put forward <e> <s> i think that a draft document has already been circulated for consideration by delegates informally before they come to the conference <e> <s> i was particularly asked what we would do in this country and those were the items to which i referred <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier in answer to my noble friend lady trumpington we greatly welcome the activities of the voluntary agencies in this sector <e> <s> but with respect to the noble lord the main thrust of his supplementary question went slightly wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the assembly is not actually one in which proposals are to be made by individual delegates <e> <s> we estimate that there will be or more delegations at the conference <e> <s> anyone who is a member of the united nations is i understand entitled to send a delegation <e> <s> as we understand it the conference is still some weeks off the principal work of the conference will be to consider an important document which as i have said has been circulated in draft <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect that is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that arising from the health service dispute there has recently been some delay in getting mail to st thomas hospital <e> <s> it is for the post office and the institution concerned to take the necessary steps to resolve difficulties of the sort being experienced at st thomas hosptial <e> <s> the post office is treating this as a matter of urgency and has already offered the hospital alternative arrangements to get its mail <e>", "<cs> my lords i absolutely agree that it is most deplorable that this obstruction has occurred <e> <s> it does if i may say so give the lie to the union assertion that you can conduct industrial action in the health service without affecting patient care <e>", "<cs> it is a pity my lords if that is the view of the trade union leaders that they do not do more to control the actions of those whose actions they say they deplore <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree as i said earlier that it is deplorable that this obstruction to the mail <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all the noble lord asked about the application of these arrangements to australian beer <e> <s> as i understand it this order applies only to our european community obligations <e> <s> it does not relate to the importation of spirits for example where i think there are no community obligations and it certainly does not apply outside the european community <e> <s> made-wine is a fermented drink made from imported grape juice or the juice of other fruits imported <e> <s> there is i understand a type of cider in france of which the noble lord may not have partaken and i must confess that i do not think i have done so either <e> <s> clearly some have and that is why this regulation applies to that <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will forgive me i think if i do not repeat all the rationale i deployed a moment ago for this particular increase <e> <s> i should like if i might to conclude simply with this point <e> <s> the building societies find themselves in competition with the banks in the supply of mortgages <e> <s> the fact is that the banks work without restriction of any kind in this area and we thought it right having regard to that having regard to the degree of inflation which has taken place since and having regard to the need to avoid coming back to parliament time and time again for modest increases in this limit to set the level at as the order provides <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble lord is right in ascribing the high-powered results from these agreements which he has described but i think it is important that people who propose to travel abroad ascertain the arrangements which will apply in the countries which they propose to visit <e> <s> my department issues a leaflet for that purpose which perhaps i could make available more widely to your lordships through the printed paper office which gives particular guidance to almost every country that people are likely to visit including of course the european community <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> we have agreement of course with the european community <e> <s> we also have agreements with some or countries outside the european community <e> <s> my noble friend mentioned iceland <e> <s> i am happy to tell him that we are on the point of concluding an agreement with that country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite certain which initiative of the council of europe the noble lord is referring to in this matter <e> <s> if he would like to give me more details i will certainly look into it <e>", "<cs> my lords in general nhs cards do not play a significant role in this matter because they are not a certificate of entitlement to treatment under the national health service <e> <s> they are issued to patients who are included on the list of a particular doctor <e> <s> as for persons entering this country again the card is not as i say a certificate of entitlement <e> <s> that particular matter is determined in other ways <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of the health service charges for overseas visitors was as the noble lord says discussed in response to a question from the noble lord lord kilmarnock a week or so ago <e> <s> i am not sure that i have anything to add to the answer that i gave on that occasion <e> <s> as for the case of zambia the country to which the noble lord is referring it is the case that we do not have a reciprocal agreement with that country and therefore the overseas charges regulations will apply in that case <e>", "<cs> my lords if there is a case for examining a reciprocal agreement with zambia as the noble lord seems to be suggesting i shall certainly be willing to do that <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will be willing to give me more information of the matter he describes <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm what i said earlier to my noble friend that national health service cards are not a certificate of entitlement to treatment under the health service <e> <s> they are normally issued to persons at birth or when they are entered on to a doctors list <e> <s> that is not the same thing as determining entitlement to treatment <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that he is pushing at an open door in this matter <e> <s> we certainly accept the merits of these agreements where arrangements can be made <e> <s> one of the difficulties is that many other countries do not have the comprehensive health service that we have and therefore a reciprocal agreement is not really possible <e> <s> it is possible however to have a limited reciprocal agreement of some sort for example the sort of agreement that we have with some of our dependent territories where primary health care is really the only thing immediately subject to the agreement <e> <s> perhaps that may be a possibility in the case that the noble lord lord hatch raised <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise that progress on these schemes has been slower than we would have wished <e> <s> however in addition to the total of places which will be available by the end of the current financial year places are currently under construction and further places are to be started hopefully before the end of this calendar year <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will be aware that the designation of funds for this purpose is a curiosity if i may call it that in the health service funding generally because as a matter of usual course we do not specify precisely the purpose for which funds which we supply should be used <e> <s> in fact million has been provided for revenue purposes and million for capital purposes in the financial year since / <e> <s> i cannot say offhand what percentage of those figures has been used precisely for rsu purposes <e> <s> but i can say that during the period that we are discussing in addition to the creation of the small number of permanent places to which i referred earlier more than interim places have been provided and of course it would be quite proper for the funds to be used for that purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords the system is that funds are provided to each regional health authority for this purpose and they propose plans for the precise number of places that they think appropriate for their particular region <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that the rsu at st lukes hospital middlesbrough is fully operational <e> <s> but i will look into that and if i am wrong will write to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that the facilities to be provided by the rsus will form an essential feature of the range of options available with regard to the detention of mentally disturbed people <e> <s> i would certainly agree with the thought behind the question of the noble lord that prison is the wrong place for the great majority of them <e> <s> there are difficulties in creating these facilities for example in planning permissions which sometimes cause a great deal of delay and i think it is right that the funds that are earmarked for this purpose are with the necessary authority sometimes used for interim facilities in particular pending the completion of the permanent facilities which the noble lord has asked me about <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that the interim facilities which have been provided play a very important part in this matter <e> <s> but the security provided in rsus whether they be interim or permanent is not of the same order as is provided in for example the special hospitals and it forms an important halfway house if that is the right term to use between special hospitals on the one hand and ordinary psychiatric hospitals on the other <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord lord rochester for his response to this statement but less obliged to the noble baroness lady jeger for her response <e> <s> the position of the opposition now contrasts very sharply with the position that pertained in february when there was industrial action in the health service at that time <e> <s> on those occasions mr ennals who was then the secretary of state for social services said <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may deal with the question of arbitration which was also raised by the noble baroness lady jeger <e> <s> it is for the government to decide how much money is available for the purpose of salaries and other wage payments in the health service <e> <s> the individual allocation of those moneys is for the whitley councils <e> <s> so arbitration of a kind at least takes place within the whitley councils <e> <s> the only possible result of arbitration would be increased salary awards and i regret to have to tell your lordships that the money is not available for any increased salary payments <e> <s> for that reason the government have felt it right not to agree that arbitration should take place <e> <s> the noble baroness if i may revert to her remarks i am sorry that i did not deal more fully with what she said earlier also referred to the tsrb salary awards particularly to judges which were announced a few <e>", "<cs> yes they are <e> <s> nurses are something like per cent <e> <s> better off now in real terms than they were in whereas judges now are only per cent <e> <s> better off than they were at that particular time <e> <s> so the tsrb award had a very considerable element of catching up involved in it and not all the catching up has yet taken place while nurses within the health service have more than caught up with any arrears which may have existed at that time <e> <s> as for the letter in <e>", "<cs> the position my lords on secondary action as i understand it it is of course a comparatively complex legal matter is that where an employer believes that he has suffered damage by way of secondary action he has the right to take civil action against those who conduct the secondary picketing for example for the recovery of damages <e> <s> it is not a criminal act but it is clearly a civil offence <e> <s> it is therefore for the health authorities to consider in any particular case whether they think they have suffered damage and if so to seek to get appropriate redress <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked what action was open to those who felt aggrieved in circumstances such as those in which the health service workers now find themselves <e> <s> i would answer that that would depend literally upon the circumstances in which they found themselves <e> <s> i think they have been made indeed i am certain that they have been made a very fair and reasonable offer <e> <s> the right course of action for them therefore is to desist from the threat of industrial action and to remain at their posts and at the same time for their representatives to go back to the whitley councils to begin discussions on the distribution of the very substantial funds million no less which are now available for distribution through the whitley councils <e> <s> as for the second matter which the noble lord raised it is the case that the funds which we have made available to the nurses whitley council is slightly higher in percentage terms than the funds which are available for the other groups of workers <e> <s> but it is right i believe that the workers who are specially concerned with patient care and who in the distant past at least have had a very unsatisfactory deal should be recognised in this way and i am quite convinced that the government have made the right move in that direction <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments policy is no such thing <e> <s> however i have been asked to give an accurate indication of the money which workers take home in their pay packets at the end of the week <e> <s> surely that is the right figure to offer to your lordships not some other figure which appears only on a piece of paper <e> <s> as i said in the statement a male full-time ancillary worker only working three or four hours a week of overtine which is not very significant in total working terms gets an increase of something like a week <e>", "<cs> my lords as i indicated in answer to an earlier question to the dismay apparently of the noble lord lord mishcon it is indeed the case that the opposition at the time of the last serious dispute in the health service did stand by the government and it is a pity that we do not have the same support now <e>", "<cs> my lords i doubt whether the patients will be able to detect the difference between unofficial action and official action which the noble lord lord molloy asked us to observe <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that if one is a patient in hospital and the services of the staff are withdrawn it makes no difference at all whether that is official or unofficial action <e> <s> as to the figures i adduced in the statement and which my right honourable friend has prepared and to which the noble baroness lady jeger also referred these are as i said before the figures reflected in the wage packet at the end of the week and i would have said that they are the most helpful ones <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right in drawing comparisons <e> <s> since the total pay bill in the national health service has increased from billion to billion which is precisely a per cent <e> <s> increase <e> <s> the total costs in the health service at the same time and the total money made available to the health service by the government since has increased from billion in to billion for the current year <e> <s> these are very substantial sums <e> <s> they surely indicate our total commitment to a flourishing health service <e> <s> at the same time the staff has significantly increased too <e> <s> i do not believe that we can be accused of neglecting the health service <e> <s> we are making enormous resources available and yet at the same time we are not supported by the workers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of the standard or cost of living of individual judges or for that matter of individual nurses <e> <s> the fact is that there was a substantial element of catching up involved in the pay award made to judges and it applies to only a very small number of people <e> <s> it might be worth saying in that same context that the total number of nurses has increased in the same period by some per cent <e> <s> and now stands at something approaching half a million <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the accommodation charges are still under discussion with the whitley council and it is too early to draw the comparison which the noble baroness wishes me to draw <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that is the case <e> <s> it is also the case that student nurses and nurses asked to live in sub-standard accommodation enjoy substantial discounts <e>", "<cs> my lords i am greatly obliged to the noble lord lord byers for his response to the statement <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede was less enthusiastic towards its contents <e> <s> the noble lord lord ponsonby asked me a whole string of questions and perhaps i may reply to those which i believe he would regard as the most important <e> <s> first with regard to rural costs and coin-box telephones unhappily it is the case that the cost of the provision of all utilities whether the utility be water electricity telephones gas or anything else is much higher in rural areas for example to remote houses in the midst of wales than it is in the centre of a large town or city <e> <s> however as at present constituted british telecom has a certain duty spelled out in section of the british telecommunications act to provide its services save where it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with my noble friend that the difficulties which telephone users have been subjected to in recent times particularly the sharply escalating cost of the service are matters from which we ought to offer them the earliest possible relief and i am certain that this is the best way to do that <e> <s> as to whether or not the government w ill retain per cent <e> <s> or any other percentage of the shares in this corporation i should say that that is not a matter upon which we have yet reached a final decision <e> <s> speaking for myself i see no reason why in principle we should retain any particular percentage of the corporation but in the first instance we are proposing to dispose of the per cent <e> <s> which is referred to in the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all on the monopoly question as i said when i repeated the statement a second network has now been licensed the mercury consortium and it will be open to them to provide such additional services as they feel able and as they want to do <e> <s> value-added services that is to say services which derive their usefulness from being attached to the network will be generally licensed under the provisions which again are referred to in the statement <e> <s> on the question of employee shares which the noble lord raised and i regret i did not reply to that point when the noble lord lord byers raised it it is certainly our intention that employees should be entitled to acquire shares <e> <s> the detailed proposals have not yet been worked out but i fancy they may well be something along the lines of the scheme we devised for british aerospace the bill for which passed before your lordships a year or so ago <e>", "<cs> my lords it is one thing to create a scheme to facilitate the purchase of shares in a company by the employees of that company that is what we did in terms of british aerospace and that is what we have in mind to do in respect of british telecom it is another to insist that they hold on to those shares for ever and a day <e> <s> sometimes they sell them for perfectly good and justifiable reasons <e> <s> most of the schemes that are devised in this sort of area usually have a proviso that the shares have to be held for a certain period by trustees or some such but i think that the important thing is to make available the necessary facilities for employees in the business if they wish to acquire shares at the outset <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have explained the existing level of telephone charges is set having regard to the need not only to provide the running costs of the network and the equipment but also to make provision for per cent <e> <s> no less of the capital investment of british telecom in any particular year <e> <s> under the new arrangements british telecom will be able to borrow as they think fit on the market and as they are able to do so and this may well relieve them of some of these very high capital appropriations which have to be made <e> <s> that is the first answer to my noble friend but there is going to be a considerably greater degree of competition generally in the telephone service overseen as i have said by a new director-general and i am certain that that too will have an effect on the charges to which my noble friend referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that the fear of the noble lord will prove to be unfounded <e> <s> the telephone arrangements at present are that there is an initial fixed charge for the installation followed by annual or quarterly rentals and then additional charges are levied in respect of each call <e> <s> with a simple installation the fixed charge is not unprofitable and i see no reason why difficulty which the noble lord foreshadows should arise <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord mishcon has pointed out the purpose of this amendment was discussed at the earlier stage <e> <s> the purpose of enabling the courts to include negative requirements is to strengthen the supervision order <e> <s> our intention is to restore the confidence of the courts in the use of this non-custodial measure particularly in cases where the offender might otherwise be given a custodial sentence <e> <s> a negative requirement can be included in an order only under the provision which this amendment would delete and after the court has gone through several steps and these have been strengthened since the provision was debated in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i have permission to speak just once more <e> <s> both sides of the house appear to agree that we need to provide the court with the maximum number of non-custodial options <e> <s> these supervision orders are one of those options but they have unhappily fallen into disuse in recent years because of their shortcomings <e> <s> one of their shortcomings we seek to reduce if not eliminate by providing for these negative conditions <e>", "<cs> my lords it may come as something of a surprise or as a disappointment to your lordships that the performance which i am about to give so widely foreshadowed and expected is unlikely to achieve the rave reviews that are hoped for <e> <s> during our discussion in committee i described this as a serious and thoughtful amendment which deserved proper consideration <e> <s> indeed the noble lord lord harris has himself given it further consideration for the power to resentence for breach would now be available only within six months of the making of the supervision order and not as in his earlier amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for interrupting but i rather thought that the noble baroness would have preferred to deploy her arguments on this point and listen to the fairly long response that i fear i have to make on the following amendments and not on this one which deals with a slightly narrower point <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to deal briefly first with amendment no <e> <s> and before i sit down deploy what i fear will be my rather slightly lengthier thoughts on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> on amendment no <e> <s> i am totally sympathetic to the intentions of the amendment but i hope that the noble baroness will not wish to press it because i believe that it is superfluous <e> <s> the government are already committted to revising the community homes regulations and to introducing criteria for admission to and retention in secure accommodation <e> <s> the existing regulations include a large number of references to periods of time for example the permission of the managers of a home that includes secure accommodation must be obtained if a childs placement is to extend beyond hours and that of his care authority if a placement is to extend beyond days <e> <s> there is of course the requirement for the three monthly reviews <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to respond to the point raised by the noble lord lord avebury <e> <s> i have said that we would wish to bring forward legislation at the earliest possible moment <e> <s> it is not possible for me to foreshadow precisely when that would be but i can say that i should be very surprised if it proves to be as long a period as the noble lord appears to fear <e> <s> with regard to the <e>", "<cs> my lords with permission i should like to make two points arising from the remarks of the noble lord lord elystan-morgan <e> <s> clause about which he asked me closely is a permissive power <e> <s> it allows regulations to be made and we shall be consulting about the regulations themselves <e> <s> on the decision to embark upon the building of adequate secure accommodation that i understand was made by the labour administration of mainly in order to provide adequate secure facilities to enable the practice of remanding juveniles to prison department establishments to be ended <e> <s> that is a policy with which everyone agrees <e>", "<cs> my lords again with your lordships permission i happily confirm that the noble lord accurately read a passage from the letter which i wrote to him and also that it is our intention to bring it forward with the regulations incorporating this point during the next session <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first stress that i sympathise very much with the intention behind my noble friends amendment <e> <s> it reflects the widespread concern which of course i share about the need for careful and regular reviews of the case of every child in care <e> <s> there is already a firm statutory requirement for authorities to carry out such reviews at not less than six-monthly intervals <e> <s> there is also on the statute book a provision originally enacted in the children act and now consolidated in the child care act enabling the secretary of state to make regulations which would govern the way in which such reviews are carried out <e> <s> we are anxious that there should be such regulations and very much regret that we have been unable to bring them in for want of the very considerable resources estimated at some million a year which would be needed <e> <s> but when we are able to do so we shall certainly be consulting widely with all interested bodies on the content of the regulations <e> <s> there will be an opportunity for comprehensive consideration of the way in which cases should be reviewed <e> <s> and that will be the right time to my mind to consider the very important ideas which underlie this amendment <e> <s> in the meantime i do not think it would be right or helpful to institute a procedure for one group of children in advance of this wider consideration and in isolation from children in care generally for whom reviews are equally important <e> <s> but i thank my noble friend and indeed the noble and learned lord opposite for their views on this matter <e> <s> i happily give the house an assurance that we shall bear these views most carefully in mind when we come to consider the specific matter of reviews <e> <s> with that assurance i hope that my noble friend will feel able to withdraw her amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house as i understand it the existing reviews are conducted within the local authority and thus the additional resources would be related to the magistracy as the noble and learned lord said <e> <s> this costs money and that is the figure which i am advised it would cost <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not in a position to give to your lordships a detailed breakdown of the sum to which i have referred but surely it stands to reason that an additional load upon magistrates courts or upon magistrates costs money <e> <s> the magistrates courts system is already a quite expensive system not so much because of the salaries because magistrates do not draw salaries but they do draw expenses <e> <s> and the premises in which they work are not constructed for free <e> <s> where there is a total increase in the burden additional facilities like additional accommodation have therefore to be provided <e> <s> it is not necessarily the case as my noble friend appears to think that the existing courts can accommodate the extra load which will be imposed upon them by these new arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords the cost of introducing the regulations for which statutory backing already exists was assessed i understand by a working party of my department <e> <s> it includes the cost of assisting parents and children who may wish to appear before magistrates <e> <s> i wish to stand by the figure which i have given to your lordships <e> <s> i regret that i am not in a position to give a more detailed breakdown but i have referred to some of the elements which go towards making up the cost <e> <s> i accept that by themselves magistrates expenses will not make up the million but there are the costs of the parents and the children appearing before the magistrates the costs of the premises to which i have already referred and other similar matters <e>", "<cs> my lords again with the leave of your lordships i have explained some of the elements which go towards the costs to which i have referred <e> <s> however i shall be happy to write to my noble friend and to the noble lord lord mishcon with a whole page of information if that would be helpful to them <e>", "<cs> my lords again with the leave of your lordships and i am stretching procedure more than somewhat i understand certainly if i find myself to be seriously mistaken in the figure i have offered to your lordships which i do not think will happen i will hasten to come and explain that to your lordships <e>", "<cs> may i say that i am certainly willing to write to my noble friend lady faithfull and i will be happy to see that a copy of that letter goes to lord elwyn-jones and perhaps to lord harris of greenwich <e> <s> i think lord mishcon would like a copy as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to the remarks of the noble baroness supported by the noble lord lord donaldson <e> <s> it may be helpful if before addressing the particular issue raised by this amendment i very briefly outline the different arrangements for management of community homes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness lady masham for having tabled this amendment because of the opportunity that it has given for consideration of the provision of education in ches <e> <s> all but a very few children who are accommodated in ches are of school age and it is of the utmost importance that the education they receive is or high standards and is relevant to their needs <e> <s> education in this context may also make a significant contribution not only to their adolescent development generally but also to the alleviating of those difficulties that have led to their placement in a che <e>", "<cs> my lords i am constrained not to wait to third reading but to give your lordships a short recital of the governments position on the amendment <e> <s> as i made clear when we debated an identical amendment in committee the governments aim is to clarify and simplify the existing law <e> <s> section of the children and young persons act provides that the courts must in the case of a child and may in the case of a young person order that any fines costs or compensation awarded against him be paid by the parent or guardian unless they cannot be found or the courts are satisfied that they have not conduced to the commission of the offence by neglecting to exercise due care and control <e> <s> we have simplified that by relying on the concept of reasonableness trusting to the good sense and experience of the courts in deciding what is or is not unreasonable in the circumstances of each case <e>", "<cs> my lords again with the leave of the house i think that the noble lord intervened i would say that i was referring to the present law which distinguishes between children and young persons <e> <s> i accept that clause of the present bill does not distinguish <e>", "<cs> my lords i was describing the principles upon which clause is founded <e> <s> the family is the first and foremost influence for good or ill on a childs development <e> <s> it is of the highest importance that parents exercise their influence for the good and in this they most certainly must be supported by the law <e> <s> the responsibility which parents have is one of the weightiest of the citizen parents cannot disown this responsibility <e> <s> parents may have difficulty they may not be very good at exercising their responsibility but they cannot disclaim responsibility for their children <e> <s> clause is intended to reinforce this when children become delinquent <e> <s> we start with the presumption that parents should be expected to accept responsibility for what their children do not just up to as in section of the act but up to <e> <s> this is the basis of our approach in strengthening section and it is in this light that the government looked at the tests proposed in this amendment and in the similar amendments which were tabled in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly deplore the fact that in many cases including at st thomas as my noble friend says the action of the pickets has led to very serious effects on the running of the hospital <e> <s> emergency services have in general been maintained although there have been one or two cases where even that modest level of service has not been achieved <e> <s> perhaps i could say that on the occasion of the explosions in london recently the pickets who were on duty at once went back to their posts to treat those who were injured <e>", "<cs> my lords let me deal first with the nurses <e> <s> the question of the increase in charges for nurses accommodation if there are to be any is presently being considered by the whitley council <e> <s> no agreement has been reached but when it is it will be an agreement between the two sides that make up the whitley council in that regard <e> <s> but the kind of increases that are being considered in the whitley council would in no way absorb the increases as the noble lord is suggesting <e> <s> only about per cent <e> <s> of nurses actually live in the accommodation to which the noble lord refers the rest of them of course live in accommodation away from their hospitals with their parents or whatever and they too are no doubt experiencing increases of some sort <e>", "<cs> my lords the present law as i understand it and i would want to stop short of offering your lordships a definitive definition of the legal position is that peaceful picketing at ones place of work is perfectly lawful <e> <s> of course if pickets go beyond that and break the law then that is a matter for the police in the pat titular circumstances prevailing <e> <s> as for a review of the law as my noble friend suggests that is a rather profound question if i may say so which perhaps deserves more careful consideration than i can give on my feet at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not accept that for a moment <e> <s> arbitration would i presume be some system which is what the noble lord is thinking whereby some third party would call upon the government to make more funds available for the purposes of the present offer <e> <s> i have to tell your lordships that there is no more money available and arbitration is not therefore an option <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indeed aware of the difficulties which my noble friend describes <e> <s> that is why i have asked that the action should be ended forthwith <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the fact that the trade unions have issued a code of conduct in this matter <e> <s> the pity is that it has not always been <e>", "<cs> my lords if we want to bandy across the floor of the house the relative positions of our respective parties over the years i would draw the noble lords attention to the present position of his party as compared with the position of mine at the time of the dispute <e>", "<cs> my lords on the question of avoiding this type of situation in the future i absolutely agree with the noble lord that we do need to avoid this hassle every year in the futute <e> <s> that is why my right honourable friend has initiated negotiations with the nurses to establish a machinery which we very much hope will be in place by next year to fulfil this function and that is why we stand ready to have parallel negotiations with the other trade unions to achieve a similar machinery if only they would come and talk to us about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that it is the case in times of extreme financial stringency as regards <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord cockfield said when he made the statement yesterday we very much hope that a solution to this problem concerning the united states can be found <e> <s> we believe that it can be found and in that case there will be no effect upon british steel <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly the case that british rail is an important customer of the british steel corporation but of course as in so many nationalised industries british rails own capital plan needs to be carefully monitored <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly the case that since for which i have the figures in front of me there has been a substantial reduction in the workforce of british steel <e> <s> as regards future job losses in british steel mr macgregor has made clear to the workforce that the new plan envisages further general de-manning throughout the corporations plants to cut costs and to improve productivity <e> <s> the corporation is not yet in a profitable condition and for that reason i cannot rule out the possibility of further reductions in the labour force <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right to make that point <e> <s> mr macgregors tenure of office has so far been remarkable and successful <e>", "<cs> my lords i could not put a precise figure on that aspect without further reflection but certainly improved technology is one of the features of the corporations new posture <e>", "<cs> my lords the extent of future de-manning depends among other things upon the continued level of demand for the products of the british steel corporation and it is not possible for me to put a figure on it at the present time <e> <s> but if demand holds up or even increases somewhat then i hope that the figures will be kept as low as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords that last point would i think be a question for the noble lord to address to my noble friend perhaps in the bar on some later occasion <e> <s> as for the first part of the noble lords supplementary about the quantity of steel that might or might not be required for a replacement for the atlantic conveyor i cannot without notice answer that question in terms of tonnes or in terms of workers to be retained but i presume the numbers would be significant <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i have not got figures for that in front of me perhaps i should have and i will therefore happily write to the noble lord with the figures if i can find them <e> <s> it is certainly the case that the number of persons employed by the british steel corporation has sharply declined in recent years but so too has the total level of production <e> <s> the numbers of workers have declined rather more fast than the level of production and thus the productivity has improved <e>", "<cs> my lords no one doubts that in some of the towns where british steel formerly had a major presence the social costs of what is really the decline of the world steel market have been very high <e> <s> but the social cost of allowing british steel to continue upon its original course would have been even higher <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure my noble friend is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords easter school-leavers become entitled to supplementary benefit at the end of the easter holidays and if they do not find work will therefore be able to satisfy the new three-month qualifying condition for study under the -hour rule in time to begin a course in september <e> <s> summer school-leavers who become entitled to supplementary benefit in september will not be able to satisfy the three-month qualifying period until december <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the important feature of the supplementary benefit arrangements and for that matter of the unemployment benefit arrangements as well is that those who are entitled to those benefits should hold themselves available for work and not be involved in full-time education or indeed in some job or other <e> <s> that is why the conditions which i described have been brought into effect <e> <s> we need to be certain that the supplementary benefit is not being paid to those who are simply continuing their education in one form or another <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me that the arrangements which the noble baroness is describing would be in relation to somebody who was continuing their original course of education which is not the essential purpose of the -hour rule <e> <s> but if there is a specific narrow problem which she has in mind i shall be happy to look at it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked me for the source of our information and i gave it to him <e> <s> the document to which i referred is quite comprehensive <e> <s> it is i inderstand available in the library but i should be pleased to send the noble lord a copy <e>", "<cs> my lords i would have to check whether oil production was included in the figure to which i referred <e> <s> i believe it was but if i am wrong i will write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i am afraid it is an historical fact my lords that an improvement in the unemployment <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am aware that the construction industry has shown a remarkable improvement in recent months somewhat in line with the figures to which my noble friend referred <e>", "<cs> indeed with pleasure my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware as i said in answer to the noble lord lord shinwell that the unemployment situation is far from satisfactory and is of course a tragedy for the individual people concerned <e> <s> the general trend in unemployment however is one where the rate of increase at least is not as high as it was so perhaps there is a little bit of hope even in that field <e>", "<cs> frankly my lords i heard the noble lords supplementary on the first occasion he asked it <e> <s> i understand the point he is trying to make and i attempted to answer it by saying that we accept that the position in terms of unemployment is far from satisfactory <e> <s> i do not attempt to explain it away or apologise for it but it is not a feature of the document to which i referred <e>", "<cs> i would not accept that my lords <e> <s> i gave the figures in my original answer relating to the increase in productivity for the quarter march april and may of this year <e> <s> i accept that we are probably now on something of a plateau <e> <s> i certainly do not accept that productivity is likely to decline <e> <s> the important thing is to keep inflation under control and to notice the drops in interest rates for example which have occurred over roughly the same period <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is quite right my lords but it is fair to say also that there has been a very substantial improvement in productivity in british industry in recent months <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that the noble lord has views which differ from those of the government <e> <s> i am afraid that i just do not agree with him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of the concern which doctors have expressed about the effects of the industrial action <e> <s> we have consistently urged the trade unions to call off the action which can only be harmful to patients and to return to the negotiating table <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i deplore the effects of the industrial action however it may be manifested but in particular in the case of sterile supplies in regard to which in a number of cases departments have been reduced to issuing supplies for emergency purposes only <e> <s> as for the determination of emergencies that is of course a matter for the doctors concerned and not for the medically unqualified personnel and i believe that the unions appreciate that <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a rather different matter <e> <s> but of course i deplore industrial action whenever it takes place in the health service and we have made our views clear on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord is referring to something slightly different <e> <s> my noble friend was referring in particular to the hospital service within the health service <e> <s> with regard to the effect on general practitioners patients i should say that in some parts of the country some gps indeed many gps i think are having difficulties as a result of <e>", "<cs> my lords we have indeed made a very substantial offer to the workers in the health service <e> <s> your lordships will be familiar with the percentages but the total sum of money at present on offer is in excess of million a quite enormous figure <e>", "<cs> no i do not accept that for a moment my lords <e> <s> as the noble lord will know the increases spread across the various grades of worker range from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> and are even higher in some of the grades within the particular whitley councils <e> <s> i think the offers which have been made in global terms are entirely fair and reasonable but the individual distribution of those sums is for the whitley council <e>", "<cs> my lords if the mail is being impeded then it is a matter for the local police who would presumably act upon information received from the district health authority <e> <s> the legal position is not quite as simple as the noble lord describes it because in some cases the problem has simply been that postmen are unwilling to cross picket lines <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think there should be any picket lines at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the social security benefits up-rating order be approved <e> <s> i hope it will be for the convenience of your lordships if i speak at the same time to the subsequent six motions standing in my name on the order paper and then move those motions formally when we come to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been confronted with a very considerable number of points raised by the two noble lords and the noble baroness who have spoken <e> <s> i shall do my best to deal with as many as i can <e> <s> it is interesting to note that much of what has been said this evening has been concerned less with the contents of the instruments before us than with other improvements which the government might have introduced if the necessary resources had been available or with the recounting of changes in social security provisions which have been made in earlier years again largely to reflect the resources then available <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very fair point <e> <s> i am not entirely clear about the answer <e> <s> i think that they do not include them but i will ascertain the position and write to the noble baroness <e> <s> the noble baroness also asked about publication of the information and arrangements relating to these matters particularly the so-called s manual which is the main guide to supplementary benefit procedures for local office staff and is being revised to incorporate the guidance on the application of the law which the chief supplementary benefit officer issues to benefit officers to assist them in making decisions on claims to benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it once the estate is designated as being hard to heat then all those on the estate in receipt of supplementary benefit will automatically get this adjusted heating allowance <e> <s> i suppose that it will be for the first tenant who applies to have this up-rated allowance and at that point the estate will be designated or not according to the merits of the application <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should first deal with the point made by all three noble lords who have spoken and i am grateful to them for their contribution to this debate about the nil cost aspect of these proposals <e> <s> i can confirm that these proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the fourth motion standing in my name on the order paper namely that the united kingdom central council for nursing midwifery and health visiting electoral scheme order be approved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to your lordships for your reception of this motion and i am particularly grateful for the informed intervention of the noble baroness lady mcfarlane <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will now approve the order <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord elton i rise to move amendment no <e> <s> in his name <e> <s> during the committee and report stages of this bill your lordships expressed considerable concern that our present arrangements for reviewing the placement of children in secure accommodation might be in breach of the european convention on human rights <e> <s> at report i outlined the governments draft proposals for revising the arrangements for the use of secure accommodation and undertook to consult relevant organisations on them <e> <s> it did not seem likely that we would be able to bring forward a considered scheme in time to be included in this bill and i therefore gave the house a firm commitment to seek an early legislative opportunity to introduce proposals taking the consultation fully into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i do apologise for interrupting but this is rather an important point and i hope i have the leave of the house to do so <e> <s> we never accepted that our arrangements were in breach of the european convention <e> <s> that would be much further than we ever went but we did agree that there was some room for doubt and it was to resolve that doubt that i have brought forward this amendment today <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first touch on the point made by the noble baroness lady masham of ilton <e> <s> all secure accommodation is approved for use by the secretary of state who is of course my right <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for missing that amendment <e> <s> i am in large measure sympathetic to the intention behind it which i take to be to ensure that where a child is to be placed in secure accommodation it is likely that he would injure himself or other persons and that that likelihood should have been demonstrated by previous dangerous behaviour <e> <s> i think there are good reasons for not accepting that particular proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords the power to which the noble viscount refers is of course contained in other legislation <e> <s> what we are looking at here is a specific power to submit this particular kind of legislation to requirements the times and so forth that may be provided for it is particularly to ensure that the new provisions are precisely in compliance with the european convention <e> <s> it is for this reason that we have provided for this new power for my right honourable friend to make regulations and have precisely defined in this particular subsection the nature of those regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not propose to divide your lordships on this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should make it clear right at the outset that i have great sympathy with the thinking behind this amendment <e> <s> it is most important that the statutory reviews of children in care which are required every six months should be used for a proper consideration of the future needs of the child <e> <s> where a care order applies the review must include consideration of whether to make an application for <e>", "<cs> my lords i was about to say that my objection to this amendment is not on the grounds of cost <e> <s> in fact i did say that as far as these particular reviews which my noble friend proposes are concerned it would be much less than the figure to which i referred <e> <s> the hallowed figure if i may call it that of million of course refers to the case of all the children in care which is not the purpose of my noble friends amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords that is largely the position at the present time as my noble friend has pointed out and indeed as i said during the course of my remarks <e> <s> there are no doubt cases when that is not the most desirable way to proceed but the important thing is that we should proceed in accordance with the best professional advice in each individual case and that is what the regulations will in due course provide <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend may be referring to a case that attracted some publicity recently namely the case of a drug called zyloric which is apparently available in spain at about a quarter of the price at which it is available in this country <e> <s> it was a special case <e> <s> that drug has been available in spain for about years and it was introduced into that country in at which time it was more expensive in spain than it was here <e> <s> but since that time price controls in spain have prevented any price increases apart from two recent ones and the sale of that drug in that country is now unprofitable for the manufacturer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to hear about the noble lords unfortunate experience but our own method of controlling price and profit levels is of course the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme <e> <s> it does not control the price of individual drugs which are fixed by companies but it ensures that excessive profits are not made <e> <s> british pharmaceutical companies make a very large contribution to our exports the balance of payments in our favour in pharmaceuticals is about million per annum they invest heavily in research and development and employ about people <e> <s> it is important that they should be given a proper return on their investment and of course we take these benefits into account in operating the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i am looking at the cost of drugs right across the spectrum <e> <s> some drugs in this country are more expensive than they are elsewhere some drugs in this country are less expensive than they are elsewhere <e> <s> i was taking a broad look at the position when i made the general assertion which i did just now <e> <s> perhaps i should add that of course in some of the countries of europe not all of them they do not have the large pharmaceutical manufacturing industry which we have in this country and we have to take the interests of that industry into account when operating our scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right that the source of funds for research purposes in the pharmaceutical companies is from the margins they make from the sales of their products <e> <s> it is also the case that without the necessary controls upon the manufacture and sale of pharmaceuticals one cannot he certain where the drugs come from whether they are counterfeit whether they are contaminated or indeed whether they are the product they say they are <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has put his finger on what i believe is a very important point <e> <s> i wonder whether he has seen the work done by professor turner at barts hospital where he has prepared what is called a formulary to give advice to doctors and others about the best and most economical drugs to prescribe in any particular case <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect that goes slightly wide of the question on the order paper but speaking from personal experience as regards my own cat which had to go to the vet recently we found it very expensive <e>", "<cs> yes my lords in total goverment expenditure on the national health service in england was billion <e> <s> last year we spent over billion <e> <s> this represents growth in services of about per cent <e> <s> in real terms and there will be further growth this year <e> <s> over the same period net current expenditure on personal social services grew by some per cent <e> <s> in real terms <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> if i may underline what i said just now we are spending more now in real terms on the national health service than ever before <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no region in the country which in real terms is suffering a cut in the funds which we are making available to it <e> <s> by real terms i mean that we are providing more money than just the increase in inflation would necessarily require <e> <s> that is what i mean by real terms and the increase in real terms over the time during which we have been in office is about per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i confess that i have been asked that question before in your lordships house and i do not think that i have been able to give a satisfactory reply <e> <s> the figures for scotland are separately collated <e> <s> i do not have them in front of me but i shall write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether the question of unemployed people is particularly relevant but i take the point about the question of elderly people <e> <s> certainly in some areas there are more elderly people as a percentage of the population than there were before and the distributions of funds that we make take that into account <e>", "<cs> my lords the demographic changes as they are called in the jargon of health service economics are taken into account in the allocation of resources to the various regions <e> <s> as for the increase in elderly people to which the noble baroness lady jeger referred and which i think is at the back of the mind of the noble lord <e> <s> i believe that would account for about per cent <e> <s> of the per cent <e> <s> increase in real allocations to which i have referred <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is right when she refers to the reduction in the nurses working week which took place about the time she mentioned <e> <s> that was of course one of the reasons but not the only reason why the number of staff in the health service and particularly of nurses has increased since that time <e>", "<cs> my lords i have seen figures which purport that but there is no shortage of doctors in the health service <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that the noble lord is right in that <e> <s> i was replying earlier to the particular question of the health service and the relation of unemployed people to demands on the social services <e> <s> but of course i agree that unemployed people very often find themselves in need of what the social services can provide <e> <s> that is why we have seen an increase in the demands upon the social services and why we have responded to that increase with increased funds is real terms of about per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to say that the lengths of the waiting lists prior to the commencement of the present industrial action have been significantly reduced since we came to office <e> <s> unhappily it is the case that since the recent industrial action started the lists have lengthened again but that of course is one of the inevitable consequences of this action <e>", "<cs> my lords i must of course start by thanking my noble friend for bringing this question to the attention of your lordships <e> <s> i should like before responding to the debate to pay tribute to the valuable work which she does as national chairman of the leagues of hospital friends but particularly for the interest she has shown in rampton hospital and the encouragement which she has given to the staff working in the hospital during a very difficult period <e> <s> the league of friends of rampton hospital under the chairmanship of canon mason have given considerable support over the years to patients at the hospital to patients visitors and to the staff and i gladly include them in this tribute <e> <s> i know something of the great lengths to which my noble friend has gone in giving her personal support to canon mason and his colleagues and to all at the hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is true to say that the word cuts is not wholly appropriate in this context <e> <s> only one benefit has actually been removed and that is of course the earnings-related supplement to unemployment benefit although i would accept of course that certain benefits have not been increased at the rate that some would wish <e> <s> but these decisions have to be taken in the context of the necessity to contain public expenditure overall and i can give the noble lord no assurance that they will be restored <e>", "<cs> my lords the figure i gave was a cash figure and not a real figure as the noble lord was asking <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the figure i gave did not include the item to which the noble lord referred <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the figure i gave included the money saved from that source <e>", "<cs> my lords unemployment benefit as such has not been cut of course it is the earnings-related supplement <e> <s> i do not have a precise figure for the sum that has been saved by that change but it is of the order of million <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the commons amendments be now considered <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i should like to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> to inclusive and then to move the remainder formally as we reach them <e> <s> i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> to <e> <s> these amendments concern compulsory admission to hospital and guardianship <e> <s> several of the amendments amendments nos <e> <s> and -are purely technical and i shall not detain your lordships with a complicated explanation unless there is a particular point which a noble lord should like me to clarify <e>", "<cs> my lords let me say straightaway that i have a great deal of sympathy with what the noble lord lord winstanley has said but i can assure him that the timetable for the bill has not been arranged in such a way as deliberately to deny your lordships an opportunity to amend the commons amendments <e> <s> i of course appreciate that the bill is one which began its life in your lordships house and was the subject of considerable and important debate here under the guidance of my noble friend lord elton <e> <s> but i think it would be right to say that the vast majority of the commons amendments which are before us today would in general be welcomed by your lordships <e> <s> many of them were certainly taken up in another place in response to points made here in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i was discussing a longish-term situation as my noble friend put it <e> <s> i believe that it will be possible for hospitals to obtain the services of the medical officer who is the appropriate medical officer in this case and if a genuine difficulty arose i have no doubt that they would re-nominate someone if that is what is necessary <e> <s> i really think that my noble friend is exaggerating the difficulties in the situation that may <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already done so <e>", "<cs> my lords these six amendments that is to say nos <e> <s> to made to part v of the bill in another place are for the most part technical and i will not delay your lordships by expounding them in detail <e> <s> i believe however that your lordships will be particularly pleased to see amendment no <e> <s> which extends the range of options open to a mental health review tribunal when considering a case <e> <s> this was a matter raised by your lordships both in committee and on report <e> <s> your lordships may recall that we had intended to provide for this extension by means of the tribunal rules made by my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor but so as to make our intentions absolutely clear to both houses we have agreed instead to provide for this extension on the face of the bill itself <e> <s> i hope your lordships likewise will be persuaded of the merits of this proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i can satisfy your lordships on this point <e> <s> the advice i have is that regulations are being prepared and will come into force within the next few months <e> <s> i deduce from that although i do not have it in black and white that the consultations are complete and that it is now simply a matter of completing the necessary administrative arrangements <e> <s> i would certainly hope that the regulations will be in force by the time the act comes into force <e>", "<cs> my lords we now come to a topic and a block of amendments through which we shall have to pick our way with care particularly through the procedural niceties of an amendment which my noble friend lord mottistone proposes to move in respect of one of the commons amendments <e> <s> i will with your lordships permission move that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> to a <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall deal first with the points raised by my noble friend lady faithfull and then i shall come to the others <e> <s> as regards the position of the patient who seeks a certain kind of treatment one of the kinds of treatment that will be covered by these amended provisions if the second medical opinion does not agree that the treatment would be given then it will not be given <e> <s> all of these treatments require the consent of the patient that is the main body of the treatments <e>", "<cs> my lords i now move amendment no <e> <s> formally and i think my noble friend lord mottistone will wish to move his <e>", "<cs> my lords we are considering only the most extreme kinds of treatment such as psycho-surgery <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord is anticipating offering himself for that kind of treatment <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that with your lordships permission i must at this point intervene <e> <s> it is not a government clause that we are discussing the amendment was proposed by the noble lords honourable friend in the other place <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise if i intervened rather hastily when the noble lord lord wallace of coslany was speaking a few moments ago but i did not want the noble lord inadvertently to convey to your lordships the impression that the amendment was some kind of government plot <e> <s> at the outset i want to make it absolutely clear that the amendment was proposed by the opposition in the other place and accepted by the government and therefore enjoyed the support of the two largest parties in the other place <e> <s> i hesitate to say that it enjoyed all-party support <e> <s> i am not certain what the attitude of the other parties in the other place would have been that was not clear from the record of the debate that i have seen <e>", "<cs> my lords i confess that i had forgotten the question that the noble lord had asked and i must also say that for the moment i have lost the answer too <e> <s> i wonder if the noble lord will forgive me on this occasion and allow me to write to him with the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i have already spoken to this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> to <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> this amendment is consequential upon amendments nos <e> <s> to <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> with your permission may i speak at the same time to amendments nos <e> <s> to and <e> <s> these all relate to the mental health act commission and its functions <e> <s> a number of them relate to a wider power to investigate complaints including complaints from former detained patients and complaints by other people about the use of the statutory powers <e> <s> the commission is also given a wider duty to keep under review the exercise of all the powers in the act and the discharge of the duties it imposes <e> <s> the first of its biennial reports will be made two years after it is set up a year earlier than was proposed when the bill left your lordships house and the code of practice will he subject to a negative resolution procedure to facilitate parliamentary scrutiny <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be a mistake to impose too many burdens on the commission in the early months and years of its life <e> <s> certainly i think that annual reports would be too great a burden but i hope the noble lord lord kilmarnock will agree that what is now proposed is at least an improvement on the original provisions in the bill <e> <s> that is not to say that the mental health act commission could not and would not produce <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> my lords i obviously did not speak as clearly as i should <e> <s> i am moving amendments nos <e> <s>

friend that assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house doth agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> to <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house doth agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> to <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house doth agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> and which were discussed with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first point of my noble friend about the drafting and the otiose words to which he referred your lordships will have heard him make that kind of complaint before <e> <s> i have to confess that my noble friend is almost always right in drawing the attention of your lordships to these difficulties <e> <s> i am sorry that this one has been detected at such a late stage in the passage of the bill that we might have difficulty in persuading the usual channels that time ought to be found in the other place tomorrow to consider just that point <e> <s> so i hope that my noble friend will not persist with it <e>", "<cs> my lords with permission i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> to <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i agree with the figures which the noble lord has advanced <e> <s> the top rate of tax when we came into office was something like per cent <e> <s> on unearned income and about per cent <e> <s> on earned income <e> <s> these rates were widely believed certainly so far as the government were concerned and i believe so far as many members of the opposition were concerned to be insupportable <e>", "<cs> my lords if the manifesto of the party opposite had been put into effect as a result of the general election at that time the level of tax now would be vastly greater than it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not deny that we should have preferred to move faster in reducing the general level of taxation than has in the event proved possible <e> <s> the main thrust of our economic policy was <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that was the point i was trying to make that the money available to the average income earner is significantly greater now in real terms despite the fact that we have been unable to reduce taxation as fast as we would wish <e> <s> and that is as a result of the main thrust of our policy which is to get inflation under control <e>", "<cs> my lords it has certainly been necessary during the course of our period in office to ensure that inflation is brought under control and as part and parcel of that policy that public expenditure is kept under control also <e> <s> as i have already said we should have wished to move faster in reducing the level of taxation <e> <s> that has not proved possible but we hope that it will prove possible in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords the containment of the rate of inflation which we have achieved to a very remarkable extent i believe during the time we have had responsibility for these matters started in the face of the real difficulties which are now widely accepted and public knowledge <e> <s> we are not suggesting that prices are being reduced <e> <s> it is the rate of increase initially which we have sought to contain and we have been very successful in doing that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certainly aware of that and it contributes to the figures to which i have referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not for a moment agree that the price of gas being set at a proper market level is some element of taxation <e> <s> of course it would be possible to give away gas <e> <s> of course it would be possible to give away electricity generated or created at the public expense <e> <s> but that would be a most unwise policy and would not in any way represent government thinking <e>", "<cs> my lords gas is a form of energy <e> <s> there is a very clear market level for the right price for a particular source of energy when compared with other sources <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly the case that we have sought and have achieved increases in the price of gas faster than the increase in inflation but that as i have explained was to bring the price of gas up to a clear comparison with other forms of energy <e> <s> prior to that gas which is a very attractive form of fuel for many purposes was being sold well below the proper market price <e> <s> quite apart from the economic considerations this was not a proper husbanding of scarce resources <e>", "<cs> my lords if i was to list the unwise policies of the previous administration i should be here all day <e>", "<cs> that may well be my lords but it was the noble lord lord hatch of lusby who tabled this question <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to amend the law relating to the financing of certain social services in england and wales and scotland and to children and young persons to make fresh provision for the central council for education and training in social work and further provision for the remuneration and conditions of service of medical practitioners in the national health service and health service officers to amend the law relating to homes regulated by the nursing homes act the child care act the residential homes act and the childrens homes act to change the status of family practitioner committees in the national health service to repeal enactments about the designation of health authorities as teaching authorities and membership of authorities so designated to make further provision for social security adjudication to abolish certain advisory bodies to make minor alterations in certain enactments relating to health and for connected purposes <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords with the permission of the house i will now repeat a statement being made by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for health in the other place <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> i did <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for the welcome that they have given to the statement <e> <s> i should first like to deal with the points made by the noble lord lord wallace of coslany <e> <s> the noble lord asked why was it just now that we were making an offer in respect of the nurses and midwives and related professions and not to the other members represented by the tuc health services committee <e> <s> the fact is that we made a revised offer on th september and have had discussions with the nurses representatives more or less continuously since that time <e> <s> it was only last friday i think that the representatives of the tuc health services committee actually came to have a discussion at all <e> <s> previously they had rejected out of hand the proposals which my right honourable friend had put forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i made myself clear in either the statement or the subsequent response to noble lords opposite <e> <s> i emphasise that we intend to consult on the proposals and therefore maybe to change them in the light of the consultation <e> <s> we have certainly not reached a final view as to which of the professions on the margins of the ones that the noble lords are describing ought or ought not to be included within the ambit of the new review board <e> <s> but at present we have in mind that it should include nurses midwives health visitors physiotherapists radiographers remedial gymnasts occupational therapists orthoptists chiropodists dieticians and speech therapists which i believe cover most of the professions that the noble earl had in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not at present have in mind to include within the ambit of the review body the grades to which the noble baroness refers but i make it clear that we have no closed view on the question <e> <s> we intend to consult on the proposals that we have made and maybe to adjust them in the light of the consultation <e> <s> it was not we who divided as the noble baroness suggests the various groups of workers within the health service <e> <s> even after september th if you leave aside what happened before that time it was the nurses who came in response to the proposal that we had made for discussions with us and not the other groups who spurned the offer of discussions that we made at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords i have on a number of occasions explained to your lordships why the government cannot proceed along the line that the noble lord suggests namely to appoint an arbitrator to determine these matters <e> <s> as i have said many times it is for the government to decide what is the total sum of money available for this purpose and then to allow the whitley councils to formulate and make the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to my noble friend for that information <e> <s> not for the first time he puts his finger on the nub of the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord thinks that the effects of the industrial action have been anything other than serious he is i assure him deluding himself <e> <s> it is of course true that not all the ancillary workers have been on strike <e> <s> indeed in some areas very small numbers indeed have been on strike <e> <s> but they have been carefully selected so that they have <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that the tuc and the main unions involved in the dispute issued some guidelines with regard to the maintenance of emergency services but i have to tell your lordships that those guidelines were not adhered to and there were cases where emergency services were not maintained <e>", "<cs> my lords it was a very substantial sum of money as the question indicates and that was the essential difference on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords it will become part of the public sector borrowing requirement when and if the guarantee is called but of course we hope that will not happen <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand it is the first time that a loan of this size has involved the treasury and thus called for the guarantee to which the noble lord refers <e>", "<cs> my lords another difference apart from the one to which i referred earlier is the statutory basis on which these guarantees are made <e> <s> this latest guarantee has been done in accordance with the general arrangements for providing for public expenditure which are different from the specific arrangements which lead to the guarantees to which the noble lord referred <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of whether or not the noble lord wishes to pursue the matter further is one for him and the usual channels <e> <s> as for the relations between mexico and the united states that falls rather wide of the matters for which i have responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords the bonus will be paid from week commencing th november on the same basis as last year and in accordance with the provisions of the pensioners payments and social security act <e>", "<cs> my lords million <e>", "<cs> my lords in order to restore the bonus to its value the payment would have to be about and that would cost an additional million in public expenditure as has been said so often the main thrust of our policy is to contain and reduce inflation thus preserving the value of these benefits <e> <s> however i have to say that it would not be possible to restore this particular bonus to the figure that i have just indicated nor indeed to any other figure above the one that we are making without imposing unreasonably upon the public purse <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord contemplates what is going to happen next year he might perhaps reflect upon the fact that pensions are to be increased by per cent <e> <s> next monday <e>", "<cs> my lords naturally we shall want to keep the matter under review as time passes but i must say that it will not rate high in the priorities when compared with other improvements of benefits which yet press upon us <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite correct <e> <s> the bonus is tax free and it will cost about million this year <e>", "<cs> my lords opticians are entitled to purchase their lenses or their frames from wherever they please provided of course that the items they acquire meet the required standards and they are then entitled to claim reimbursement at standard rates <e> <s> of course all this is in the context of arrears of some million or million or even more due to opticians which have arisen over the last four years or so <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the important thing is to be sure that we get the best value for money out of the sums of money that we make available for these purposes and to make our purchasing arrangements accordingly <e>", "<cs> my lords that was the arrangement in the past in view of the fact that reimbursement was at a standard rate <e> <s> that is one of the things that we are looking at now <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly the case that there was some anxiety about the prices charged for private spectacles <e> <s> i am happy to say that there has been some indication of these prices having gone down in recent months following our new arrangements with regard to national health service spectacles because opticians used to maintain that they had to subsidise <e>", "<cs> my lords i have endeavoured to explain that the noble lord lord rugby is mistaken in the assertion contained in his question but anything after that is for the noble lord himself <e>", "<cs> my lords i must emphasise that the government have no evidence of any falsification of accounts such as the noble lord sugests but he must use his sources from where he finds them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether the noble lord is referring to private customers or health service customers <e> <s> health service customers get their spectacles in accordance with the provisions of the health service scheme under which they pay a fixed charge <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself rising to my feet rather earlier than i had at one time expected during the afternoon and therefore i hope that your lordships will think it appropriate if i reply at slightly greater length than i might have done had the hour been a little later <e> <s> if i see your lordships getting restive i will rapidly wind up my speech <e> <s> i would naturally wish to join those noble lords who have expressed their appreciation of the opportunity given to us by the noble lord lord wells-pestell to debate this important subject again today <e> <s> it has been an important and fascinating debate and i have listened to it with very great interest <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend if i may call her that raises a very important point <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords i do have a lot of information on that and i wonder if the noble lord would allow me to write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords it is i fear an inevitable consequence of industrial action such as we have seen recently in the health service that there should be some resultant difficulties like the extension of waiting lists to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> as for priorities the <e>", "<cs> my lords the proposed transfer of patients from tadworth to the st marys hospital at carshalton which has been referred to in the press recently will of course have to come to ministers for approval <e> <s> naturally they will want to consider that matter very carefully <e> <s> on the general question of resources for the health service it is not true that we have reduced health service resources <e> <s> on the contrary we have significantly increased them <e>", "<cs> my lords nobody will disagree with the noble lord about the importance of the work being carried on at tadworth court <e> <s> but the fact is that the facilities there are not being fully used <e> <s> the proposal is to transfer those facilities to the st marys hospital at carshalton <e> <s> the noble lord will be aware of that <e> <s> the two hospitals great ormond street and tadworth court are as the noble lord will know operated by a single special health authority and it is the proposal of that board as it is called that we shall have to consider <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend puts his finger on an important point <e> <s> one of the features of the so-called rawp formula is to provide funds for things called cross-boundary flows which goes some way towards meeting the anxiety expressed by my noble friend <e> <s> i agree that the rawp formula may not work as efficiently as it should in this particular area and that is certainly a matter we would want to keep under review <e> <s> i certainly share my noble friends admiration for st marks because that is another of the hospitals that i have visited recently <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the anxiety which the noble baroness refers to <e> <s> again it is a case of achieving the best use of limited resources <e> <s> it is not always wise to spread resources right across the country in other words to duplicate facilities all over the place and not achieve their full use anywhere <e> <s> however i am certainly aware of the anxiety that the noble baroness refers to and of course that too will be carefully considered by ministers before any decision is taken <e>", "<cs> my lords nonetheless it is a case of using facilities to the best effect <e> <s> there are other facilities which provide the services at the royal marsden and naturally we need to be certain that they are all used to the best advantage <e> <s> at the same time of course we need to take into account that it is not possible for example to have such facilities in one location only <e>", "<cs> my lords it is i fear the case that those who enter the waiting list as non-urgent may if they have to wait a very long time then become an urgent case <e> <s> then of course they are differently considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i doubt whether increased secretarial resources would enable the committee to give more thorough consideration to this <e>", "<cs> my lords without wishing to be flippant in reply this is of course a very serious subject perhaps i can best help the noble baroness by saying that the main thrust of the work which the inquiry is concerned with relates to achieving viable pregnancies in women who would otherwise not be able to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that a preliminary report could be achieved only by skimping over the evidence that has been received and by hastily reaching conclusions on it which i do not think would be the right way to proceed in this matter <e> <s> as i said in the first answer we have asked a large number of groups to give us their views <e> <s> we have asked for those views by the end of next march and clearly the committee cannot be expected to consider all the evidence in detail before then <e> <s> i do not think that the time we envisage after next march for them to consider the evidence and produce the report is unreasonable and i do not think it could be properly hastened <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said the evidence will come from a wide range of different groups and the various members of the panel who are considering this evidence will i think want to consider all the evidence and not just some of it <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier no religious persuasion is represented on the committee but i was asked about the viewpoints of various members who are on the committee and i gave the answer <e> <s> the fact is of course that all the churches will be asked to give evidence to the committee <e> <s> i have a list in front of me of no fewer than various religious bodies including all the free churches and they will be asked to give evidence in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said no member of the committe is particularly representing the church of which he happens to be a member <e> <s> the members are there because of their particular expertise in these matters which may not particularly be a religious expertise <e> <s> but the views of all the churches will certainly be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that that is not a question for me <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said just now in answer to another question the main purpose of these inquiries relates to the promotion of viable pregnancies in women who could not otherwise achieve them <e> <s> this surely is thoroughly laudable and something which should be encouraged and assisted by all possible means <e> <s> i recognise that there is some anxiety about research going beyond that <e> <s> your lordships may have seen the guidelines put out last week by the medical research council which will greatly assist in these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords the board of governors of the hospitals for sick children has recommended the closure of tadworth court hospital and the transfer of its services to queen marys hospital carshalton a few miles away <e> <s> my honourable friend the minister for health is considering this proposal carefully will be receiving representations and will visit both hospitals before a final decision is made <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord slightly exaggerates the position but i will certainly undertake that the views of the noble lord and of your lordships are conveyed to my right honourable and honourable friends <e> <s> however the decision confronting my right honourable and honourable friends is a difficult one and not quite so simple as perhaps the noble lord imagines <e>", "<cs> my lords there is unused capacity at queen marys carshalton <e> <s> i have visited the hospital and seen some of the facilities there <e> <s> as for the wider point which the noble baroness makes about funding the operation of hospitals which sometimes take their patients from all over the world the government are thinking about this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is of course quite right <e> <s> the governors are very responsible people <e> <s> they have reached this decision in the face of what are undoubtedly great difficulties <e> <s> the government have to have their interests at heart too <e>", "<cs> my lords there are very many demands upon the taxpayer <e> <s> i am afraid that this is only one of them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord seems to think that the recommendation of the governors is totally without merit <e> <s> i can assure him that that is not the case <e> <s> there are many arguments in favour of what the governors propose <e> <s> my right honourable and honourable friends will have to take all these matters into consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is quite correct <e> <s> i believe she is thinking of the royal marsden hospital about which she asked me the other day and possibly of st marks of which she is also aware <e> <s> i told the noble baroness the other day about the position at the royal marsden <e> <s> i think it was another of my noble friends who asked me about st marks <e> <s> there is a rumour abroad about st marks being closed but i know of no foundation for that rumour <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i shall now intervene to repeat a statement being made by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for industry in another place about the european community discussions on steel <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords for their reception to my statement although the noble lord lord bruce had a good number of points to raise and i shall deal with as many of them as i can <e> <s> he asked whether there could be a debate in your lordships house on these important matters <e> <s> as he knows that is not a matter on which i could give him an assurance <e> <s> it will of course be discussed through the usual channels and i should certainly be happy to take part in any such debate should one be arranged <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right to say that the world is in great recession at the present time and i suppose that that lies at the very heart of the problems not only of the british steel corporation but of all the steel manufacturing companies of the european community <e> <s> the first step so far as we are concerned in restoring the world economy to health is to get our own economy into a healthy position and that is what our policies are aimed to achieve <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly i shall convey the thoughts of my noble friend to my right honourable friend <e> <s> as for the impact of energy costs upon the problems of the steel corporation this is a point that was raised also by the noble lord lord bruce of donington and i skated over it somewhat <e> <s> as i said the other day in answer to a different question from a noble lord opposite of course the raising of energy prices to a competitive level which is what has been happening in recent years is not imposing a special burden on the british steel industry or on any other industry but is lifting from them the prospect of any form of assistance with energy costs and that is a very different matter <e> <s> we have chosen a policy of restoring <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first take the opportunity to thank all your lordships who have contributed to the debate today <e> <s> if i may say so it is very helpful to ministers at this early stage in a bills progress to hear the reactions of noble lords and to have suggestions as to how the provisions of the bill might be strengthened or improved <e> <s> i have listened very carefully to the points raised this afternoon <e> <s> some of them i will attempt to answer in a moment others may require more time to think and work out and i promise to write to the speakers concerned as soon as i have had a chance to consider with care the issues that have been raised <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very sorry to say that the screening procedures to which the noble baroness lady jeger refers are not preventative they simply determine the existence or otherwise of this unfortunate disease <e> <s> furthermore there is no evidence as yet although we are conducting a study to look into this matter more carefully to show that this screening helps the expectation of life of those who are found to suffer from one or other of these diseases <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to say and i was surprised to discover this that the noble lord is mistaken and that that is not correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i must adhere to what i said earlier that the existence of the screening techniques welcome though they no doubt are in psychological terms are not yet proven to have a significant effect on the longevity of the patients <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that the noble lord lord byers is correct in that but i was referring to the longevity or otherwise of patients who are discovered to have the disease <e>", "<cs> my lords i did see the figures to which the noble lord has referred but unfortunately they were not accurate <e> <s> the costs of the unit for the year will be around and the unit will examine around or so patients that is or so attendances <e> <s> therefore the cost is as i have described it to be <e>", "<cs> i am afraid my lords that those who examine the evidence come to the conclusion which i have conveyed to your lordships <e> <s> the fact is that early diagnosis of this unfortunate disease does not necessarily lead to longer expectation of life <e> <s> as i have said there is a shortage of concrete evidence on this fact and we are conducting further studies to clarify the position <e>", "<cs> my lords my honourable friend will wish to consider all these matters very fully <e> <s> the studies to which i have referred are not likely to bring concrete conclusions before <e> <s> in the meantime some screening procedures at least are available at other places but that is not to say that my honourable friend has reached a conclusion on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords we are talking about a particular problem of breast cancer and the question put to me was whether early diagnosis resulted in a longer or shorter expectation of life and i had to report to your lordships the conclusions which we have so far reached on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness goes too far to reach that conclusion <e> <s> there are a number of different types of breast cancer and the prognosis for these different types is different in each case <e> <s> it is important that we get more knowledge on this matter and that is why we are conducting the studies to which i have referred <e>", "<cs> my lords the cost to which i referred is a proportion of the total costs of the royal marsden hospital calculated in accordance with a proportion of the capital charges and other items which exist <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise of course that this disease or the prospect of it and anxiety concerning it is widely felt among women and i am not surprised <e> <s> but there is a large number of other ways of determining the existence or otherwise of this disease <e> <s> for example there are screening methods other than the particular type which is carried on at this hospital and which are equally widely used <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness is suggesting that the board of governors are any less anxious about this matter because they happen to be men rather than women then she is mistaken <e>", "<cs> my lords guildford is one of the places at which the study to which i referred is being carried on and of course the conclusions reached there will be of great value in reaching final conclusions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure why it should cause anxiety <e> <s> there are a large number of different screening methods <e> <s> one of those type methods is carried on at the royal marsden <e> <s> there are other places where the same methods are carried on and there are of course a large number of other clinics where less sophisticated methods are employed <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord reached the wrong conclusion if i may say so from what i said <e> <s> what i was doing was casting doubt if doubt it was on the screening procedure not on the operations <e>", "<cs> my lords i yield to no one in my admiration for the technical advances which have been achieved within our medical profession in this country <e> <s> there have of course been no cut-backs the noble baroness if i may say so is mistaken <e> <s> the royal marsden itself has received a growth in its allocation this year <e>", "<cs> my lords we have made it clear that one of the advantages of the two-year settlement that we have proposed on which the staff groups are now consulting their members is that it gives time to seek new ways of determining pay and avoiding disputes <e> <s> in the case of nurses and professions allied to medicine we have proposed the establishment of a review body to advise on pay from st april <e> <s> for other groups of staff we have proposed that discussions about improved long-term pay arrangements start immediately on the conclusion of negotiations in the whitley councils on the current pay offers <e>", "<cs> my lords no doubt if we had conceded the original unrealistic pay claim a lot of the industrial action would have been avoided <e> <s> but the government cannot subcontract their obligation and it is an obligation to determine the sum of money available for pay purposes within the health service <e> <s> that is what we did and it is for the whitley councils to determine the allocation of those funds <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it would be of service to the nhs to provide unlimited funds for the purposes the noble lord describes <e> <s> it is the governments duty to decide the total sum of money available for this purpose <e> <s> we cannot abrogate or subcontract that duty in the way that the noble lord asks <e>", "<cs> my lords the conduct of industrial relations in the health service is not in the first instance a matter for the government it is a matter for the regional and district health authorities <e> <s> but i cannot get away from what i have been saying to the noble lord lord molloy <e> <s> the government really do have a responsibility for determining the total sum of money available for these purposes as indeed does any responsible employer <e>", "<cs> my lords i have explained in the past the distinction between the health service workers and some of the other groups of workers to which the noble lord draws my attention <e> <s> of course the per cent <e> <s> claim of the national health service workers was not actually per cent <e> <s> because they were asking for increased holidays and reduced working hours at the same time <e> <s> their real claim was around per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords as i say it is for the government to determine these matters the total sums of money available we have as the noble lord knows proposed a review body for the nurses and for the professions allied to medicine where a procedure not too far removed from what the noble lord proposes would doubtless take effect <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the railway tribunals findings are not binding on the railways board <e> <s> in any event the railways board and say the national coal board are different altogether in kind from the national health service because they are trading enterprises <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is of course quite right to say that many people have settled for wage increases considerably less than the per cent <e> <s> by which most benefits were uprated earlier this week but of course it was not the intention to uprate benefits by this excess whatever it may turn out to be over and above inflation <e> <s> the target is always as it was of course in the time of the previous administration to match the increase with the rise in prices <e>", "<cs> my lords the sum of money which the noble lord mentions is not yet properly established <e> <s> the figure which my right honourable friend referred to in the other place was the amount by which he was proposing to adjust the social security budget as a whole for the part year not a whole year running from the uprating next year to the end of march <e> <s> it was never the intention of the legislature it was certainly never the case when noble lords opposite and their right honourable friends were in power that pensions should be uprated above the rate of inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords the poverty trap and the problems which it brings in its wake are a pretty wide subject on their own perhaps a little wide for question time particularly on a day when we have a debate on these matters to follow shortly <e> <s> but i take note of what my noble friend says <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the noble lord is quite right we did add this year a small percentage to make up for a shortfall last year <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a number of improvements in social security benefits which we would like to make when the necessary funds are available <e> <s> as to the per cent <e> <s> abatement to which the noble lord referred my right honourable friends in the other place have acknowledged and accepted the principle of restoring that abatement as soon as resources allow <e>", "<cs> my lords we have not yet made any detailed anouncement in respect of the adjustment which the noble lord asks about <e> <s> it is perhaps worth noting that since we came into office retirement pensions for example which are of course a very important if not the most important benefit have increased in real terms by something approaching per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords no announcement has been made about the rate of any adjustment which may be made next year <e> <s> that is a decision which will be taken along with all others when my right honourable and learned friend the chancellor of the exchequer formulates his budget proposals next spring <e>", "<cs> my lords it is of course the case that the recipients of different types of benefit will wish to advance their own case to be shielded from any adjustment <e> <s> my right honourable and learned friend will take all these thoughts into account when formulating his proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising at this point in the list of speakers i should like to offer my profound apologies to the noble lord lord cledwyn for not having indicated more clearly my wish to speak at this juncture and indeed to other noble lords who have been thus displaced and to apologise for not having made my intentions clearer <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way so readily <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first ask for your lordships permission to speak for a second time in this debate <e> <s> owing to some administrative slip-up my name was not included earlier in the list <e> <s> the noble lord lord cledwyn very graciously gave way to allow me to speak at that time and thus i now need your lordships leave to speak again <e>", "<cs> my lords as my right honourable friend said in the quotation given by the noble lord that the rationale has ended as indeed it has we have accepted the principle that the per cent <e> <s> abatement ought to be restored and we will do so just as soon as resources allow <e> <s> the noble lord said that what was important to those in receipt of this benefit was not the principle but the money <e> <s> the money is also important to those in receipt of other benefits and we have to establish an order of priorities in this matter <e> <s> i should say that the restoration of this abatement is a very important matter and we shall certainly wish to do it just as soon as we possibly can <e>", "<cs> my lords i will come to the speech of my noble friend in a moment but the point i was trying to make was that a number of the people considered by the paper to which my noble friend referred are people who are not actually available for employment in the normal sense of the word and so the problems described as affecting them really do not in the sense that my noble friend has suggested arise <e>", "<cs> my lords i was addressing myself to some of the other proposals that have come forward from the party of the noble lord <e> <s> i would accept that some of the more modest proposals coming from the noble lord himself and he said they were simply part of a consultative paper i think might on the face of it appear less costly and doubtless therefore they will be less effective <e> <s> however i will certainly study what the noble lord has said with the hope of giving him a more detailed critique on another occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords as was made clear at the time and as i have made clear in your lordships house on more than one occasion the per cent <e> <s> abatement was also a matter of containing public expenditure at that time and those constraints are still with us <e>", "<cs> my lords we have indicated the date by which we would wish to see the handover take place <e> <s> however as my noble friend has requested we shall certainly not be inflexible in the discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords our support for this project is indicated by the fact that what is now happening points to the success of concordes present operations and not otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have indicated this will be a negotiated transfer and therefore there is no question of penalties arising in that context <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not a matter for the french government specifically because of course it is an arrangement between british airways and the british government <e> <s> however we are keeping them closely informed of what we are doing <e> <s> whether or not the french government wish to enter into a similar agreement with air france is not a matter for me to pass comment upon but no doubt they will be watching closely what we are doing <e> <s> as for the future of the spares which are presently as my noble friend says the property of the government they are one of the matters that will be discussed with british airways in the context of these negotiations generally <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble baroness but i must say that it is the passengers who will keep concorde flying and it is the passengers who are indeed supporting the transatlantic services to the extent that makes this transfer viable for british airways <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i know there is no ministry of defence requirement for aircraft of this kind <e> <s> however let me say at once that there is no prospect of british airways discontinuing these operations <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that they are at present making an annual operational surplus of something like million which i am certain ensures the continued operation of these aircraft for many years to come <e>", "<cs> my lords there are really only three ways in which we can do away with the poverty trap <e> <s> the first would be to lower the rate of benefits <e> <s> i do not think that the noble lord would support that <e> <s> the second would be to raise the tax thresholds further and that of course would be a very blunt instrument and would affect a great many people who <e>", "<cs> my lords the tax credit scheme to which the noble lord refers is i have to say not without its attractions but it still presents a great deal of difficulty not least the very considerable cost that it will incur and clearly it is not a runner in the short term <e>", "<cs> my lords the very small increase that we recently announced in the national insurance contribution is of course necessary to cover the cost of improving benefits which we have been doing <e> <s> i should have thought that the noble lord supported that as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i have described the problems with all the various proposals which come from the bench of the noble lord and indeed the benches of the liberal party not to mention the benches of noble lords immediately opposite <e> <s> i stick to what i said earlier the way to the long-term and lasting solution of these problems is to restore the health of our economy generally and we have made some progress in that direction <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have repeatedly said we are taking specific steps to deal with the problem by restoring the health of our economy <e> <s> as for the increse in numbers to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> i do not want to bandy statistics with him <e> <s> the figures that i have are not particularly recent and i <e>", "<cs> my lords no one has a greater regard for my honourable friend sir brandon rhys williams than i do <e> <s> but the fact of the matter is that when one studies with great care some of the proposals that come forward from such sources as my honourable friend and some of the other documents such as the one to which my noble friend referred the other day they are more difficult than may at first seem to be the case <e> <s> i do not dismiss the idea of tax credits as my noble friend suggests <e> <s> i said to the noble lord lord banks just now that those ideas are not without their attraction <e> <s> that is a long-term matter it is not something which could be done overnight and it would certainly be very expensive <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the dentists bill be now read a second time <e> <s> it is years since your lordships house had before it the dentists act the last major piece of legislation regulating the dental profession in the united kingdom and while one can say that the provisions of the act have stood up remarkably well to the test of time there are inevitably some modifications and additions which need to be made to it <e> <s> this is very much the purpose of the bill which i bring before your lordships today <e>", "<cs> my lords am obliged to all noble lords and to my noble friends who have spoken in this debate <e> <s> a large number of points have been raised and we can perhaps deal with a good many of them more effectively at the committee stage <e> <s> however perhaps i may touch on one or two now <e> <s> the noble lord lord winstanley complained that perhaps we were further restricting the activities of dental auxiliaries <e> <s> i do not think that that is so it is certainly not our intention to do so <e> <s> indeed in some areas we are loosening the controls on the work of dental auxiliaries and i hope that when the noble lord studies the provisions again he will reach that conclusion as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to take some advice if i may say so on the arithmetical correctness <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not answering that point <e> <s> i shall certainly write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble lords second supplementary is no <e> <s> as to the first supplementary question which the noble lord put to me the situation is rather different <e> <s> it is certainly part of the funds normal procedure to secure a change in domestic economic policy <e> <s> although i do not have before me the information about tanzania doubtless that was the circumstance there <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord his question goes rather wide of the question on the order paper which relates to the imf facilities which have been made available to south africa <e> <s> perhaps that could be a question for another day <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have consistently taken the view as i believe did our predecessors that it is wrong for considerations of this kind to be brought into the affairs of the specialised agencies of the united nations of which this is one <e> <s> we believe that the right way for the imf to proceed is without interference of a political kind <e> <s> that is why we support this proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree with my noble friend <e> <s> i have no doubt that there are those represented on the board of the imf who disagree with some of the policies that noble lords opposite followed when they secured imf support <e>", "<cs> my lords i absolutely agree that some of the policies followed by the government of south africa are deplorable but the fact remains that some of the policies supported by other governments which have secured imf support are also deplorable <e>", "<cs> my lords it is in the interests of all the nations of the world particularly ourselves that the economic arrangements between nations remain sound <e> <s> if the imf were to be selective on a political basis in the way that it disburses its resources that objective would not be achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that anybody in his right mind would support the proposal that imf funds should be made available to governments who are not determined to get their own economy in order and that they should be disbursed for political or sociological purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords the conditions imposed have nothing to do with the ideological persuasion of the government concerned but rather with the prospects of the money being repaid in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that would be a slippery slope if i may say so <e> <s> the united kingdom government have been criticised occasionally for alleged lapses in this area one or two recent occurrences come to mind <e> <s> i do not believe that is the right way for the imf to proceed and neither is that the governments policy <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me to decide precisely which are the best or worst bets from the imfs point of view but i certainly support the <e>", "<cs> my lords the united kingdom government have a representative on the board of the imf and we make our views known through that medium <e>", "<cs> i believe i can instantly allay the fears of the noble lord in this matter because the powers in the present section a and in subsection <e>", "<cs> i must confess that when i was considering exactly what the noble lord had in mind regarding this amendment the precise difficulty he had in mind did not occur to me <e> <s> however may i refer to some of the problems that did occur to me and then i can add further remarks at the end in accordance with the speech of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i hope your lordships will agree that in discussing amendment no <e> <s> we may also discuss amendment no <e> <s> set down by my noble friend lady faithfull <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services already has power to authorise or indeed require the appointment to joint consultative committees of persons who are not members of the authorities and he most certainly could use this power in relation to voluntary organisation representation <e> <s> however we see difficulties both of principle and of a practical nature in such a step given the large numbers of voluntary bodies in each health district their differences of organisation and the fact that at most times the joint consultative committee will wish to have access to specialist knowledge rather than generalised knowledge about voluntary activities <e>", "<cs> yes as often as you like <e>", "<cs> i have no doubt that my noble friend was addressing that question to me <e> <s> the difficulty is that the amendment seeks to make this compulsory in every case and i argue that there will be a good number of cases where it clearly is not appropriate <e> <s> i suspect that where there is a disagreement between my right honourable friend and the bodies concerned the view of my right honourable friend will prevail and so it should <e> <s> but of course my right honourable friend will be very reluctant indeed to impose his views on anybody in these circumstances <e> <s> no one knows better than i the difficulties of imposing views of any kind on voluntary bodies because they understandably resent that very much <e> <s> i am certain that my right honourable friend will want to go to the greatest lengths to avoid that <e> <s> in the meantime we are considering the amendment which seeks to make this compulsory in every case and that is the proposal which i ask your lordships to resist <e>", "<cs> the paragraph to which this amendment relates repeats one of the provisions in paragraph <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord wallace of coslany has explained the effect of this amendment would be to enable the secretary of state to make payments to voluntary organisations towards expenditure incurred by them in the provision of health services <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services already possesses the power to give assistance to voluntary bodies providing health services and personal social services by virtue of section of the health service and public health act <e> <s> the amendment will not give my right honourable friend any new power and so i hope that the noble lord will agree to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> it is already in another act <e>", "<cs> if i may just intervene again to answer the noble baroness i am grateful for the words of appreciation she used for the governments efforts <e> <s> of course it is not the governments money that we dish out with such largesse it is the taxpayers money <e> <s> i believe the taxpayers get good value for the money we issue in this way and i take note of what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> but i do believe that there is a considerable objection to adding another provision designed to achieve the same purpose as the earlier one <e> <s> the section provision to which i have referred has worked very well for a long time and i hope that the noble lord lord wallace of coslany will be happy with that <e>", "<cs> first i very much appreciate the work of the noble lord lord banks in bringing forward this amendment and i appreciate that noble <e>", "<cs> i can well understand the purpose of the amendment and i certainly appreciate the strong feelings at least in some quarters that have inspired it <e> <s> none the less i hope to be able to persuade my noble friend not to press the amendment <e> <s> the effect of accepting the amendment would be to enable a majority of local authorities in any of the existing regions to impose their wishes on the minority and deprive them of the devolution of powers and duties which is the main purpose of clause <e>", "<cs> if i have the permission of the committee to speak again since my noble friend has i think sought leave to withdraw her amendment i shall briefly answer the noble lord <e> <s> we do not really see that the function that the noble lord describes would be advanced by imposing upon unwilling authorities an obligation to plan together with others <e> <s> it might be thought that that kind of mandatory arrangement would effectively prevent some local authorities which provide homes with much-needed facilities from withdrawing them <e> <s> but it is most unlikely that such authorities would not continue to make available spare places in their homes for other authorities since this is the obvious way to keep down the running costs and maintain viability <e> <s> i am of course also dealing with the point that my noble friend raised <e> <s> i think that i should be trespassing unduly on the patience of the committee if i were to continue <e>", "<cs> i fear that my noble friends amendment gives me a little difficulty <e> <s> if i correctly understand her intention it is that before a local authority sets in motion the procedure to close a community home it should first give consideration to the special needs of any children that are being fulfilled by the home and by consulting the voluntary body concerned ensure that alternative arrangements are made <e> <s> if that is indeed my noble friends purpose as from what she has just said i think it is and i have to make certain deductions from the amendment as drafted then i am happy to assure her that the government are in sympathy with it <e> <s> moreover <e> <s> i can show that the worthy objective that she seeks will in fact be achieved through statutory safeguards in the primary legislation and indeed those proposed in this bill <e>", "<cs> i shall be very happy to look into any specific case that my noble friend brings to my attention and if the response that i give her is not satisfactory doubtless she will feel free to raise this matter at the next stage <e>", "<cs> we are hoping to introduce by virtue of paragraph of schedule to this bill provision for juvenile courts not to require the attendance of a legally represented child at court when an interim order in respect of him expires and where it is clear that the case will not be completed that day <e> <s> the proposed amendment will remove the discretion of magistrates not to require the childs attendance where the legally-represented child wishes to attend the court on the expiry of the interim order or where he expresses no clear view on the matter <e> <s> perhaps i may tell your lordships of some of the misgivings we have about the amendment <e>", "<cs> the question of which types of professional and vocational training should attract mandatory awards from local education authorities was debated fully during the discussion of what was then the education no <e> <s> bill in <e> <s> local education authorities make awards under section of the education act which specifies the categories of courses which may be designated for mandatory awards <e> <s> students on degree courses in social work are thus eligible for mandatory awards but the majority of students on non-graduate or postgraduate social work training courses do not qualify <e> <s> they do however attract support from other sources such as local authorities who release their employees on secondment local education authorities discretionary awards and from certain central government departments notably the dhss <e>", "<cs> before turning to the detailed effect of amendments nos <e> <s> and perhaps i may touch briefly on the underlying principles <e> <s> as i said at second reading the ccetsw has become too large and the arrangements whereby a large number of appointing bodies are prescribed by statutory instrument has become unwieldy <e> <s> but one of the important principles within the existing arrangements has been an equal partnership on the council between the social work profession the social work educators in colleges and universities and the employers particularly in local authorities and voluntary organisations <e> <s> it is this principle which the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord seebohm seeks to reflect explicitly in the bill and it is a principle which i know the present council considers to be important <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord seebohm decides whether or not to press his amendment may i simply repeat the assurance that my right honourable friend will conduct the consultation for which the noble lord is asking in a rather more informal basis than the one which the noble lord predicates in his amendment <e> <s> i believe that is a better way to proceed and hope that the noble lord will let it rest at that <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord renton is the distinguished president of the royal society and i happily give him the assurance for which he has asked <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord wallace of coslany has said the effect of this amendment would be to define old age as meaning the minimum state pension age a reference i suspect to the definition of pensionable age in the social security act <e> <s> we consider that it is not necessary and perhaps not prudent to define old age in this way for the purposes of the registration system <e> <s> there is a general conception of old age and whether or not a person receives personal care in a residential setting does not depend upon the attainment of a specific age but rather on his or her need for such care <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has explained the effect of this amendment would be to require the secretary of state to keep a register of all licensed that is registered residential homes and nursing homes in the country and he would also be required to maintain a register of owners and managers of such homes whose registration had been either cancelled or refused <e> <s> local social services authorities are the registration authorities for residential homes and while the secretary of state is the registration authority for nursing homes he has delegated that function to district health authorities <e> <s> in the circumstances the secretary of state is not in possession of the information necessary to compile a register of all registered homes <e>", "<cs> i have no doubt it would be possible to do that even having regard to the difficulties i have indicated but i think the objection is that however you define the list of undesirables if i can call them that those to be included in the list it would take on the nature of a black list <e> <s> i must say i find black lists a somewhat undesirable almost distasteful thing principally because of the possibility of an injustice <e> <s> as i said the reasons for which people might find themselves on such a list are sometimes influenced by purely local considerations <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord kilmarnock asked about the possibility of a list of those whose registrations had been cancelled and although i poured some cold water on that because it presents difficulties that is actually one of the things we are considering <e> <s> i cannot prejudge the outcome of that consideration because all lists of this kind entail difficulties as my noble friend has pointed out <e> <s> it might equally be possible to have a list of those convicted of some offence in connection with these matters <e> <s> we take the problem on board <e> <s> there is a problem where people might conceivably offer themselves for an appointment for which they were manifestly unsuitable and had been found to be so in a previous appointment <e> <s> i am much attracted to the line proposed by my noble friend because i am sure that responsible authorities will want to inquire into the background of their applicants and anyone who lies to conceal his background would be clearly obtaining the post under false pretences <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is right to draw attention to that necessary distinction <e> <s> we want to make sure that people who are held to be unsuitable really are unsuitable and have not simply been found so for some local reason as i described earlier <e>", "<cs> the effect of the amendment as has been described is to substitute in the bill itself a minimum frequency of twice a year for inspections one of which is to be without notice with power to make regulations prescribing the occasion and frequency of inspections <e> <s> the expressed intention is that the regulations should prescribe at least one inspection a year <e> <s> i believe i referred to this on second reading <e> <s> this frequency is considered appropriate for residential care homes <e> <s> it would be a minimum i underline that and registration authorities would be able to inspect more frequently if circumstances warranted <e> <s> on average this is about the level of inspections carried out by local authorities at present <e>", "<cs> that is a matter for the registering authority <e> <s> speaking personally i think that is a very good idea <e> <s> i do not think that we want to put into the regulation any provision which made it necessary for authorities to pre-announce their visit <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can first deal with amendment no <e> <s> and then i shall move on swiftly to amendment no <e> <s> because the noble lord has rightly chosen to speak to both together <e> <s> first amendment no <e> <s> would have the effect of removing the provision for consequential amendments to acts and regulations which may be occasioned by the fpc provisions of the bill but have not yet been identified <e>", "<cs> answering my noble friend first if i may it is of course the case that ever since the inception of the health service the family practitioners that is to say the general practitioners have not strictly speaking been part of the health service <e> <s> they have all been self-employed contractors to the health service <e> <s> what we are doing in this measure is not making that position worse or better but are changing the responsibility of the family practitioner committees within the health service <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> what is being proposed here is an alternative form of organisation for the administration of family practitioner services which the government have considered and rejected namely that of integrating them with the district health authorities <e> <s> as i made clear at second reading the majority of those whose views we sought last year about possible changes in the arrangements for fpcs favoured the solution that we now seek to implement <e> <s> as i mentioned earlier our consultations extended to health authorities and community councils <e> <s> i at this precise moment cannot provide a definitive list of the rest of the people whom we consulted but as i earlier undertook to the noble baroness lady jeger i shall most certainly prepare a list in the cold light of tomorrow morning and write to the noble baroness <e> <s> certainly i shall be willing to pass a copy of the letter to other noble lords who referred to the same point <e>", "<cs> i apologise for interrrupting the noble lord <e> <s> i wonder whether he will allow me to make one point arising out of what he said <e> <s> i intervene now because i suspect that he is about to withdraw his amendment <e> <s> i failed to make one point in answer to the noble lord lord hunter of newington <e> <s> i apologise for not mentioning this earlier <e> <s> the noble lord lord hunter put to me two points about accountability and forward planning <e> <s> in fact may i take the committee into my confidence the noble lord lord hunter had given me advance notice that he was going to raise those matters <e> <s> it was particularly remiss of me therefore not to deal with them when i was on my feet earlier <e>", "<cs> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services has made only two orders affecting joint consultative committees since these bodies were first set up in <e> <s> the first of these orders provided for most of the matters specified in subsection <e> <s> there is no record of any request ever having been made for an order <e>", "<cs> indeed i am yes <e>", "<cs> there are two factors which we took into account when deciding that it would be right for the secretary of state to appoint vice-chairmen as well as chairmen although he does not of course do so in respect of health authorities <e> <s> the first stems from the long-established practice of maintaining a balance between contractor and non-contractor membership of the committees not a feature of health authority membership <e> <s> it is our intention that in all the new fpcs the vice-chairmen should not be drawn from the same group of members as that of the chairman <e> <s> thus a contractor chairman would have a non-contractor vice-chairman and <e>", "<cs> a non-contractor could certainly be a lay person <e>", "<cs> i believe i can save a lot of your lordships time by saying that i accept this amendment in principle <e> <s> if the noble lord lord banks will be good enough to withdraw his amendment at this stage i will undertake to bring forward a suitable government amendment embodying the principle which the noble lord has enunciated at the next stage <e>", "<cs> first <e> <s> i should like to deal with the points raised by the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead or at least as many of them as i can and i will gladly write to the noble lord on some of the more arcane matters that he mentioned <e> <s> as to the first point raised by the noble lord who recounted his own <e>", "<cs> strictly speaking this amendment is not necessary because it is already open to the secretatry of state to provide funds specifically for individual hospitals and units if he so chooses <e> <s> in addition the implication that highly specialised services can somehow be insulated from judgments about the relative priority of different claims on the limited resources of the national health service is not one that we can accept <e> <s> however we are now well advanced with proposals for a new method of funding those services which are recognised as having a supra-regional character and it may be helpful to the noble baroness if i say something briefly about these <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly look into the specific examples the noble lord has referred to and let him know the position in regard to them <e> <s> the question of great ormond street has of course been discussed in your lordships house on more than one occasion and i do not think i need to repeat what has been said about that <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures i gave related to the question on the order paper which was about the national health service as a whole <e> <s> the financial considerations so far as the family practitioners are concerned are of course different <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly look into the specific case which the noble baroness has drawn to my attention <e> <s> i suspect that the same arguments will apply in that case as in the cases that the noble lord lord molloy put to me namely the question of priorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that that is an area that needs to be very carefully looked at <e> <s> it is not always the case however that administrative expenditure is misspent <e> <s> for example i heard of a case recently where it paid to provide a further private secretary for a particular consultant because it freed the consultant to get on with his proper work <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two points as i was saying to the noble lord lord molloy which we need to take into account when considering specific cases like tadworth <e> <s> they are first of all the priorities but secondly we must ensure that we get the very best value for money from the funds that we can make available <e> <s> in the case of tadworth and the noble lord will know that my honourable friend is considering that matter specifically and we have made additional funds available in the short term that hospital at the moment is less than half used and i do not think that that is the best use of the resources available <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is right to point to certain changes in some of the procedures within the national health service in recent years for example the greater use of day surgery and the greater use of short stay facilities which frees beds to be used by other patients <e> <s> but one does have to remember that such arrangements do sometimes throw a greater burden on the local social services <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i do not think that the secretary of state needs any lessons from me on how to address himself to these matters <e> <s> we have more than covered the growth in resources required by the demographic changes to which the noble baroness refers for example there has been the increase for the elderly of which i have no doubt the noble baroness is very much aware <e> <s> this is a matter of which we too are aware and the increase in resources that we have made available has more than covered that particular point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not going to give an assurance that money misspent in the health service will continue to be misspent or that half-empty hospitals will continue to remain so when there are other facilities nearby that could equally be used <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has made plain the intention behind this amendment is to exempt from charges all those people availing themselves of home help services provided by local authorities <e> <s> i am afraid i have to tell him that in that endeavour the amendment is defective <e> <s> it applies to charges made to the broad categories of disabled people provided with home help services under the national assistance act and the chronically sick and disabled persons act but does not extend to schedule to the national health service act under which local authorities may also provide home help services for other clients and make charges <e>", "<cs> i should like first to deal with the very last point that was put to me by the noble viscount <e> <s> i can say that the mobility allowance is centrally provided and what we are here discussing are services of and provisions made by local authorities <e> <s> so i can at once assure the noble viscount that the mobility allowance is not one of the matters that we are here discussing <e>", "<cs> i would need to take some advice as to the precise legal implication of an amendment other than the one that is on the marshalled list before us <e>", "<cs> as i understood it my noble friend was asking me what would be the effect of an amendment without the words to which he is referring <e>", "<cs> i had misunderstood what my noble friend was asking and i apologise <e> <s> as i understand it removing the words in the way proposed would mean that despite the bill we should be left with most of the inconsistencies to which i referred in my earlier remarks and that would be a distinct disadvantage <e> <s> i am sorry that i misunderstood my noble friend when he first put the point to me <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble lord it is not a question of intelligence but whether the local authority have the necessary information available to them <e> <s> i must say that i am unrepentant about the words in the bill <e> <s> i think that they offer a much better rgime for the future than has existed in the past <e> <s> i certainly take the point made by the noble lord <e> <s> if i am reading correctly between the lines of the speech of my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter i think that he too has some reluctance to see imposed a means-test in the worst sense of that expression <e> <s> so do i but that is not what is proposed by this provision in the bill <e> <s> i rest on what i have said already <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble baroness that is exactly what i am trying to avoid <e>", "<cs> at present the arrangements are in some local authorities at least that patients or recipients are required to pay a percentage of the cost of the service or of the item supplied <e> <s> that in some cases is a very large sum of money indeed <e> <s> it imposes a great burden on some people who are of limited means <e> <s> in future we should like to see the question of their means taken into account by the local authority not just an imposition of a bald percentage of the cost of the service which is being supplied <e> <s> i do not think that the cost of the service as far as the recipient is concerned is the right criterion <e> <s> i think that the criterion that we propose on the contrary the ability of the person to pay is a more relevant one and that is what i should like to see in the bill <e>", "<cs> if i may speak yet again on this matter that would be to replace one complex unsatisfactory system with another even more complex and probably even less satisfactory <e>", "<cs> it very much depends on the other resources available to the old-age pensioner in question <e> <s> some old-age pensioners particularly after the age of so far as men are concerned and so far as women are concerned are not means-tested <e> <s> there is no earnings rule applied to old-age pensioners after those ages <e> <s> that being so they might have very substantial other means <e> <s> i do not think that that would be a right criterion <e>", "<cs> my own father drew the old-age pension or would have done so after the age of had he lived that long <e> <s> he would certainly have been able to pay i think for the sort of facilities we are thinking about <e>", "<cs> i am not in a position to answer the noble baroness precisely because i think we want to leave some flexibility to local authorities in this matter <e> <s> i am trying to resist the suggestion that we are imposing some very formal classified precise procedure in these ways because we are not <e> <s> we are saying to local authorities that they ought to be able to take into account the means of people <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness will not press me too closely on that point because i should like to leave a good deal of discretion to local authorities on this matter <e>", "<cs> there will of course be guidance to local authorities in these matters and we shall have to see how that comes <e>", "<cs> i am certainly willing at some future stage of the bill to expand further upon the various issues that have been referred to this afternoon <e> <s> if the noble baroness wants to withdraw her amendment and tackle me again on the subject at another stage i have no objection at all to that course <e> <s> however i do not want the noble baroness to get the impression that the government are in any way wavering upon the proposals that are contained in this particular clause <e> <s> i am convinced and unrepentant that the right approach is to standardise to use a rather horrible word the procedures in assessing the charges for these services <e> <s> at the moment we are in a position where all sorts of different rgimes can and do apply generally i fear to the disadvantage of those who receive these services <e> <s> i should like a better rgime to apply in future <e> <s> that is what is contained in these provisions <e> <s> i remain willing to answer a similar amendment at another stage of the bill though i would not want the committee to imagine that the government are in any way reconsidering their position on this matter <e>", "<cs> i hope i can assist your lordships in this matter by saying that the government have complete sympathy with the principle of these amendments in so far as they seek to relieve people on low incomes and with small capital resources from local authority charges for services that they need <e> <s> it has been the consistent policy of the government that local authorities should not charge those receiving day and domiciliary services who are living at supplementary benefit levels or who would suffer real hardship if required to pay charges <e> <s> we need to be careful however about enshrining that principle in legislation and particularly in the terms proposed <e> <s> legislation removes any flexibility in suiting charging arrangements to the overall circumstances of the client <e>", "<cs> i think the noble baroness is quite right <e> <s> although i could no doubt insist upon this amendment or at least seek to i shall not do so and i seek leave to withdraw the amendment now <e> <s> if i am right in my brief that it ought to be in the bill i will bring it forward at the next stage <e> <s> but on behalf of my noble friend i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we are i think discussing amendments nos <e> <s> to which all address themselves to the same point <e> <s> local authorities have sought for some time the power to levy flat rate contributions in respect of children in care rather than <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> i said at the outset of my remarks that i thought he wanted to discuss amendments nos <e> <s> to together and that is why i made the speech that i did <e>", "<cs> the noble lord did not say no <e>", "<cs> again i apologise <e> <s> i thought the noble lord nodded in assent when i said that at the beginning of my remarks <e> <s> if i mistook the noble lord in any way i apologise <e>", "<cs> although i am always reluctant to resist an amendment simply on the basis of some alleged technical defect i am told that there is one in respect of this amendment of which your lordships will wish to be apprised <e> <s> it fails to make reference to any one paragraph of column in part iv of schedule to the social security act and therefore to any one benefit and is thus ambiguous <e> <s> be that as it may i deployed the difficulties about this amendment in my earlier remarks <e> <s> i am reluctant to bore your lordships with a further extract from what i have already said but the government see difficulties with this amendment along the lines which i described earlier <e> <s> i hope therefore that the noble lord will not press it <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that there is another small technical defect in this amendment <e> <s> if the noble lord turns his eye to paragraph <e>", "<cs> i must confess that my scrutiny thus far has not revealed any obvious technical defect in the noble lords amendment <e> <s> none the less i would ask the noble lord whether he really thinks it right to impose a detailed panoply of regulation and restriction upon the arrangements we propose <e> <s> we much prefer a more flexible approach to these matters <e> <s> experience has shown in some other areas of benefit that a whole raft of tiny minute regulations whether in statute statutory instrument or whatever tend to cost a great deal to administer throw up as many anomalies as they solve and in the end do not provide a greater level of benefit to those whom they are supposed to help <e> <s> at the same time they bring into being a great department of officials and staff of every kind to operate the system <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will therefore accept the general objection to the proposals contained in this and the immediately following amendments and although i am happy to deploy further detailed arguments if the noble lord wishes he might prefer that i did not do that <e>", "<cs> i do not want to be unreasonable in these matters <e> <s> i will certainly between now and the <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may take that point into consideration between now and the next stage as i undertook to do when replying to the noble lord lord wallace of coslany <e>", "<cs> i have no doubt that if i examine the amendment long enough a technical defect will occur to me <e> <s> in the meantime i should prefer to rest upon the difficulty i described during my earlier remarks about the inappropriateness of an upper ceiling to the amount of contributions which are payable <e> <s> complete exemption from liability is introduced for several categories of persons which i believe is one of the provisions of a later amendment <e> <s> as i said earlier there is a great deal of complexity inherent in the raft of amendments which the noble lord is now proposing <e> <s> in general i believe that these are undesirable and that is the principal difficulty with the amendment which the noble lord is now proposing <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to be unreasonable to the noble lord but at the same time i do not want to raise any unjustified expectations in his mind <e> <s> however if he does want to withdraw the amendment now and return to this matter at a later stage i shall certainly be very happy for him to do that and to give the matter further consideration myself between now and then <e> <s> but as i say i shall certainly come to this <e>", "<cs> may i make the same proposal in respect of this amendment as i did in regard to the last one and also if it would help the noble lord in respect of the next one <e> <s> thus we can dispose of this group of amendments to which i spoke in detail earlier <e>", "<cs> no no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> although the government accept the intention of the proposed amendment we do not think that it is appropriate for this bill <e> <s> a measure to achieve an incentive is however already included in that part of the package of changes agreed between dhss ministers and the local authority associations which will be effected in regulations to be made next year <e> <s> there are also technical difficulties in the amendment which i could go into if the noble lord wishes me to <e> <s> however i hope that with this declar-tion of the governments intent the noble lord will seek leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the capital disregard of is only one of the many factors taken into account in assessing a residents ability to pay for part iii accommodation in accordance with part iii of schedule i to the supplementary benefits act <e> <s> those provisions also governed the supplementary benefit system itself until november but then new regulations introduced a separate capital rule for supplementary benefit <e> <s> the two rules are now of quite a different character <e> <s> for supplementary benefit the rule is a complete capital cut-off with more than of capital no benefit at all is payable <e> <s> for residential charging purposes <e> <s> is the starting point for assessment with a tapering arrangement based on assuming p a week of income for each of capital above that level so that the assessed ability to pay rises gradually and does not reach full payment unless a very much higher level of capital is held <e> <s> although historically it was the case that the same rules were applied for both purposes there is in fact no very good reason why they should have been because the two purposes are entirely different <e> <s> the supplementary benefit system is designed to provide a safety net of financial support for people looking after themselves <e> <s> the residential care charging system by contrast is designed to reflect peoples ability to contribute to care which is being provided for them <e>", "<cs> no i do not think it means that <e> <s> i do not have the reference in front of me but it means the assets that are specifically assessable in <e>", "<cs> the most obvious example i can give to the noble lord this may also help the noble baroness is where an elderly person disposes of his house for example to a relative or a friend so that that is not taken into account or so he imagines in assessing his ability to pay the charges for the accommodation <e> <s> that is the type of situation that we are seeking to control the deliberate abandonment of an asset disposal in other words for the purposes of avoiding paying these charges or of avoiding paying them at the highest level <e> <s> of course in the imaginary circumstances that i have suggested the house would be sold for nothing or next to nothing <e> <s> that is the type of situation that we are proposing to control under this provision <e>", "<cs> if your lordships will look at amendment no <e> <s> which is part of this group your lordships will see that further details of this matter are provided in that direct reference is made to the provisions of the national assistance act <e> <s> but what we are here proposing is some kind of control over a circumstance where an elderly person deliber <e>", "<cs> that is the effect of the group of amendments which i have moved <e>", "<cs> i cannot immediately put my finger on the words but i will in a moment if the noble baroness will bear with me <e> <s> i want to persist with the view that what we are really proposing here is a means of restraining people who are deliberately divesting themselves of their assets in order to avoid paying the charges and are doing so in a way which in other circumstances might be regarded as fraudulent <e> <s> that is what we are seeking to control and i hope that your lordships will agree that it is the right thing to do <e>", "<cs> that seems to me not to fall within the ambit of these provisions because the purpose of that disposal was not deliberately to avoid having to pay the requisite charges <e>", "<cs> let me say at once that my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> first i want to put before your lordships the general proposal that is contained in these measures <e> <s> it is that sadly there are some people who find themselves wishing to go into part iii accommodation as it is called and who chose to do so <e>", "<cs> if the noble baroness will again do me the honour of referring to the marshalled list of amendments i would draw her attention particularly to amendment no <e> <s> which gives more detail as to how the assets will be assessed <e>", "<cs> in answer to the noble baroness lady masham i referred earlier to the provisions of amendment no which is one of the amendments that we are now considering which defines the assets to be taken into account as those defined in the national assistance act <e>", "<cs> as i said earlier and i think that i have covered this point three times the question of deliberate avoidance falls to be assessed by the local authority <e>", "<cs> i hope that your lordships will not agree to the deletion of this clause <e> <s> i am not inclined to brush aside quite so readily as the noble lord is the <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble baroness would allow me to intervene <e> <s> i shall tell the noble baroness exactly when deliberate abandonment as the expression is first came into parliamentary parlance <e> <s> it was in the supplementary benefits act paragraph of schedule to that act passed in the time of the government of the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i could not agree to do that <e> <s> this clause is an important part of the proposals we bring before your lordships in this bill <e> <s> its intention is to apply a greater degree of justice to the people whom it will affect not less justice <e> <s> i hope your lordships will agree to include it <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble baroness she is terribly confused over this <e> <s> that does not surprise me because this a confusing matter <e> <s> as for deliberate abandonment when referring to the national assistance act i was answering her about the type of assets that were to be taken into account <e>", "<cs> that was not what i said with respect and if she looks at the record tomorrow she will see that i said something different <e>", "<cs> i said to the noble baroness lady phillips that there was a precise definition of deliberate abandonment in schedule to the supplementary benefits act <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness pose a perfectly proper question but i would want to study what she said and consider precisely the implications of the example she gave before offering a definitive answer <e> <s> i rest on the basic assertion which i have put before your lordships several times that we are seeking to deal here with deliberate abandonment as defined in the statutes <e> <s> i now have before me the supplementary benefits act and from its appearance the committee will understand why it is not my everyday bedside reading <e> <s> paragraph of the provision to which i referred says <e>", "<cs> the noble lord bowls a fast one at me and i believe he is correct <e> <s> however it does not depart from the principle enshrined in the statute <e> <s> it certainly does not depart from the principle of the proposal that i put before the committee which as i <e>", "<cs> with the permission of the committee i should like to speak at the same time to this amendment and to amendment no <e> <s> in the name of the noble lord which i think addresses the same point <e> <s> section of the social security act and regulation of the supplementary benefit determination of questions regulations already require insurance officers and supplementary benefit officers respectively to dispose of claims and questions within days so far as is practicable <e> <s> while there is no equivalent special provision for urgent needs payments it is accepted that such payments should be decided as quickly as possible and there is provision to make interim payments in certain circumstances <e>", "<cs> ministers are often criticised for commissioning too many reports and letting them gather dust in dark pigeon-holes <e> <s> we should be careful before imposing upon ministers yet another duty and burden in considering annually another substantial report <e> <s> but more seriously i am certain that we should be careful too about imposing on the chief adjudicating officer the further duty of preparing an annual report <e>", "<cs> these three amendments would restore the present position on appointment of tribunal members under which one member of both nilts and sbats is drawn from a panel representing employees <e> <s> the intention of the change we are proposing in the bill is to retain existing arrangements for nomination but to broaden the base to include not only representatives of work people and employers but of other groups as well such as the disabled and single parents <e> <s> claimants are of course drawn from a wide spectrum and we consider it desirable that committees or organisations which represent them also should have an opportunity to nominate members <e> <s> trade unions will still be invited to nominate members but they will not retain their existing monopoly on nominations of one of the members <e> <s> the council on tribunals has welcomed the change we are proposing <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will not press his amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords what my noble friend describes may well be one of the possible ways forward in this matter <e> <s> the particular complexities to which my noble friend refers i think principally derive from the need to meet the requirements of the common agricultural policy and the vast range of products that that policy encompasses <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord if i may say so puts his finger on the nub of this problem <e> <s> clearly the new system will be of little advantage if only a few of the nations of the world adhere to it <e> <s> certainly the adherence of the united states and canada and indeed of japan would in our view be crucial <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not in a position to give the noble lord the assurance for which he asks but i can tell him that his views and the views of those he repreesents will be fully taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i absolutely agree with the noble lord that it is right and proper that the steel industries throughout the european community should reduce their capacity in the same proportion that we have reduced ours <e> <s> we have heard a good many fine words about intentions on this in the community <e> <s> we shall be watching to see that those fine words are turned into fine action and we are particularly concerned about the position of italy <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is mistaken in imagining that there is any difference between ourselves and the european commission on this matter <e> <s> the commissioner who is concerned with these matters count davignon is of one mind with us that there must be equal misery for all in this matter and he is determined to achieve that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the noble lords concern to ensure the independence of the tribunal clerk but i should explain that the role of the clerk particularly clerks to sbats has changed greatly over the years <e> <s> since the publication of the bell report in particular they have not been expected to intervene or give advice during tribunal hearings <e> <s> their role is a purely administrative one and the changes being made in the present bill will emphasise this <e> <s> the appointment of a president and regional chairman and of legally-qualified chairmen should ensure that the clerks role is restricted to administrative matters <e> <s> the president will be consulted on the appointment of <e>", "<cs> i hear what the noble lord says in connection with this amendment and i accept that in principle such a system might be feasible but i very much doubt whether it would be either practical or desirable <e> <s> it would mean that lay tribunals would have to determine medical questions on the basis of medical advice <e> <s> both the claimant and the department would probably have to field their own medical representatives and the tribunal hearing would therefore become adversarial and the lay tribunal would sometimes be faced with having to decide between conflicting medical opinions <e> <s> i think that such a system would be far less likely to be satisfactory than the existing longstanding arrangements under which a legally-qualified chairman sits with two eminent medical consultants on the medical appeal tribunal which is charged with looking at the facts impartially <e>", "<cs> we keep ourselves constantly informed of the views of the council on tribunals if i may say so <e> <s> at least one member of the council is also a member of your lordships house and volunteers his views on these matters from time to time to the great advantage of your lordships <e> <s> we are certainly aware of the views of the council on these matters <e>", "<cs> when we say of seven years standing we mean seven years practice in the appropriate profession <e> <s> seventy years standing in the appropriate profession would be a very long time indeed but perhaps a mere bagatelle to some of your lordships <e>", "<cs> there is no upper age limit as far as i know <e>", "<cs> the question whether someone is eligible for attendance allowance is mainly a medical one since the most difficult issue is whether the medical conditions for attendance allowance are satisfied <e> <s> it requires skilled medical assessment to decide this and lay adjudication officers would not be competent for example to interpret the medical advice that they receive where the case was not clear cut <e> <s> i also believe that it would be a mistake to discount the accumulated wisdom of the attendance allowance <e>", "<cs> i think that i can satisfy the noble lord on this matter because i believe his amendment is based on a misunderstanding <e> <s> the repeal of paragraph of schedule to the social security and housing benefits act which is what this provision effectively achieves does not alter the existing powers of review or rights of appeal of claimants in any way <e> <s> the reason for repealing this provision is quite simply that it is no longer needed <e> <s> we have taken equivalent powers elsewhere to provide appropriate powers of review and appeal <e> <s> that is in the revised subsection of section of the supplementary benefits act which is revised by paragraph of this schedule <e> <s> furthermore we are also repealing in this bill section <e>", "<cs> my noble friend really asked me two things following the strictures <e> <s> he asked first for an assurance about consolidating legislation <e> <s> i cannot give him an assurance in the terms in which he asked for it but i hope that this will be possible speaking personally in the reasonably near future <e>", "<cs> if the noble baroness wishes to do that it is a matter for her <e> <s> i certainly rest by what i said in connection with that amendment <e> <s> this amendment concerns a wholly different matter <e> <s> as i said to the noble baroness lady jeger subsection reproduces what is available under current legislation which is exactly what i said to the noble baroness lady masham under the previous amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords <e> <s> the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos asked a whole range of supplementary questions and i shall answer as many as i can <e> <s> the noble lord first asked what could be described as the root cause of bscs problems <e> <s> i remind him that one of the root causes lies if i may say so in the previous governments failure to stop the united kingdom manufacturing industry from pricing itself out of home and world markets <e> <s> between and wage costs per unit of manufacturing output rose by per cent <e> <s> in france per cent <e> <s> in the united states per cent <e> <s> in japan <e> <s> per cent <e> <s> in germany but by no less than per cent <e> <s> in the united kingdom <e> <s> that is the fundamental difficulty with which british steel is now being faced <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the first point put to me by the noble lord this has nothing to do with the next general election <e> <s> the problems are caused by the sharp decline in the markets in which british steel operates and the serious financial difficulties in which they now find themselves <e> <s> these problems as i said just now are of comparatively recent making <e> <s> indeed during the earlier part of this year we thought that they would not arise <e> <s> as for the question which the noble lord put to me about the port talbot strip plant decisions on that will be taken in the context of the corporate plan which as i have said we expect to receive within a month or two <e>", "<cs> my lords the decisions on these matters will of course emanate in the first instance from the european commission <e> <s> but your lordships will recall that present arrangements with the european commission concerned with support for the steel industries throughout the european community expire at the end of by which time we must have ceased national aids to the various steel industries <e> <s> i think that the problem to which my noble friend points will be solved by that time <e>", "<cs> my lords if my memory serves me right mr macgregor is not an american by birth <e> <s> but be that as it may the government have total confidence in mr macgregor <e> <s> we believe that he has done a splendid job and i ask your lordships to reflect on what would be the losses today of the british steel corporation had he not been there <e>", "<cs> my lords the long-term future even the medium or perhaps the short-term future of bsc rests with first of all the increase in the market for steel and steel products and secondly as my noble friend rightly points out a continued improvement in the levels of productivity and efficiency of the corporation <e> <s> there have already quite recently been some important improvements in productivity and in efficiency within the corporation <e> <s> there is certainly room for more <e> <s> however these matters must really be left to the british steel corporation and i know that they are very well aware of them <e>", "<cs> my lords the solution to the problems of british industry generally about which the noble and learned lord has asked me of course lie in the restoration of the health of our economy above all in containing inflation and we have had some success in that and in containing government expenditure public expenditure which goes hand in hand with that too <e> <s> i do not of course deny that in some local towns in the country including llanelly for which my father once had the privilege of playing as centre-forward in their football team there have been serious difficulties but i am certain that the future lies in the overall restoration of the health of the economy and that is what our policies aim to do <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> it is the responsibility of the commission anyway in the first instance to make the necessary arrangements as my noble friend describes <e> <s> there is <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is of course quite right proposals that come forward for production quotas within the european community have to go to the council of ministers <e> <s> the noble lord went on to ask me whether i could assure him that these new arrangements would be stuck to even if the old ones were not <e> <s> as i said in the statement and as i have emphasised since then the government are absolutely determined that the required production capacity by other european community countries will be reached and adhered to and i am certain that that is the long-term future for these affairs <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will forgive me i think that he has misunderstood me <e> <s> i know the figures to which he refers <e> <s> i referred to the labour costs and not to the labour rates of pay <e> <s> labour costs of course relate not only to the rates of pay but also for example to efficiency of working <e>", "<cs> my lords i of course recognise the importance of the british steel industry within the context of british industry as a whole <e> <s> indeed the thrust of what the noble lord has said is reflected if i may say so in the statement when we said that for the time being at least the five main integrated plants will remain open <e>", "<cs> with respect to the right reverend prelate my lords that is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i know none <e> <s> these people were in general convicted because they were receiving benefit far more than that to which they were entitled <e>", "<cs> as i said in the answer my lords per cent <e> <s> of those arrested were charged <e> <s> virtually all of those charged but not quite all have since been convicted but a small number of cases remain to be dealt with <e>", "<cs> my lords the total initially arrested i think numbered of whom as i said were subsequently charged <e> <s> the other hundred or so were not charged because the evidence available was not thought to be sufficient to justify prosecution <e>", "<cs> my lords none was detained for longer than hours <e>", "<cs> my lords i think if i may say so that the noble lord plucks figures out of the air in this matter <e> <s> the extent of alleged fraud in regard to social security for example is very much greater than the figure he mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords the basis of the complaint against all those who were charged i think i am right in saying all those who were charged was that they were not living at the address in oxford at which they were claiming to live and they were subsequently convicted in that sense <e> <s> regarding the second part of my noble friends supplementary i am afraid i must answer her in the same sense in which i answered the right reverend prelate that is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that is a question i really need answer because the assertion inherent in it does not bear examination <e> <s> however it might be of interest to know that for the year ended april the departments investigators achieved benefit savings of million through the detection of fraud at a cost of some million <e>", "<cs> my lords as i told the noble lord on th november in the debate on the welfare state we accept the case for making good this abatement and will do so as soon as the necessary resources can be made available <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously the noble lord read only one paragraph of the debate to which he referred because my right honourable friend also said that one of the other reasons for making the abatement was as a necessary economy in public expenditure <e> <s> the rationale for that move still exists <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so the noble lord seems to have a very short memory <e> <s> we have treated the working classes as he calls them a good deal better than did the government who preceded us <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is right in that the cost of restoring the abatement would be of the order of million or million as he said <e> <s> but the question of the revenue from taxation is irrelevant because it has never been the case that tax from a particular source is hypothecated for any purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be the noble lords view but it is not mine <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have to determine the order of priorities in these matters and as we said at the time the priorities meant that we had to make this modest abatement to unemployment benefit <e> <s> i might perhaps add to those who complain about unemployment benefit coming into tax that the fact is that most married people for example living on unemployment benefit or essentially so do not pay tax at all <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> we had to establish as i have said to the noble lord lord monson the order of priorities in this matter and we had to decide that there were other things on which we needed to spend the scarce resources that we have for these purposes at the time and as i say we will make good this abatement as soon as we can <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose that that applies to every penny that the government dispose of <e>", "<cs> my lords we did not promise to return this money from july this year as the noble lord suggests <e> <s> as i said in answer to the noble lord a moment ago the rationale lay in two parts in this matter <e> <s> first of all there was the question of the benefit coming into tax and secondly the question of containing public expenditure <e> <s> the question of containing public expenditure continues to be of the greatest importance but we shall make good this abatement just as soon as we can <e>", "<cs> my lords as the leeds western health authority has taken no closure decision in relation to the ida hospital the question is hypothetical <e> <s> in any event before an opposed hospital closure in the yorkshire region can be referred to ministers the issue must first be considered by the regional health authority of which the noble baroness is a distinguished member <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i agree that as the noble baroness has said the hospital was designated as a demonstration centre in medical rehabilitation <e> <s> i would certainly also agree that the service provided is an important one for the district concerned <e> <s> but that does not necessarily mean that these important functions ought to go on for ever in the same building <e>", "<cs> my lords if this matter comes before ministers these points will certainly be taken into account as doubtless they will be by the regional health authority upon which as i say the noble baroness sits if the matter should ever come before it <e>", "<cs> yes my lords geriatric provision generally is a matter of considerable importance <e> <s> i should say that that is not the specific purpose of this hospital which is dealing in the main with those who are hopefully to return to a normal life sooner or later but who have suffered some particularly grievous illness in the meantime <e>", "<cs> my lords these are all matters which will certainly be considered by the district and the region in due course <e> <s> may i correct one point which the noble baroness made <e> <s> the hospital as she says has just over beds but only about of them in fact are used for the rehabilitation role <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord lord tordoff for his response to this statement and indeed to the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> first on the question of assigning responsibility for this decision which my noble friend chose to do on this occasion there is very good legal precedent for that <e> <s> a number of cases have produced decisions in support of that arrangement and indeed it has long been the practice that such a thing can be done <e> <s> i shall be happy to provide the noble lord with detailed legal references if he would like to see them <e> <s> as for my noble friends personal position in this matter which the noble lord lord underhill chose to question my noble friend has of course acted with complete propriety in this matter right from the very start and that is why he delegated this decision to my honourable friend mr rees <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it would be in order for me to intervene at this moment <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord harris for that intervention with which i agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not see any reason why this company should not acquire anderson strathclyde <e> <s> a number of possible ill effects have been pointed to but they are all purely speculative <e> <s> for example the suggestion that the management of anderson strathclyde would suddenly collapse under the new ownership does not seem to me to be a proven assertion <e> <s> of course mergers occasionally bring some management difficulties which have to be ironed out but i see no reason to believe that those difficulties would be any more acute in the case of this company which is to remain a scottish company with its registered office in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords all departments of state make a large number of decisions every day of the week some large some small <e> <s> very many of those decisions are delegated to junior ministers and many more are delegated to officials in the department <e> <s> it has long been established by tradition that this is an appropriate way in which to proceed <e> <s> indeed it has long been established by the courts that this is an appropriate way in which to proceed and this was the way in which my noble friend chose to proceed on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hatch of lusby raises points which are wholly irrelevant <e> <s> there is nothing to prevent british people from investing in south african companies or in companies which have interests in south africa <e> <s> there is no law against that <e> <s> the shareholders of anderson strath-clyde are perfectly entitled to sell their shares where they will subject only to the provisions of the fair trading act which we are considering today <e> <s> it was on that basis that my honourable friend took his decision <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to that question is <e> <s> no <e> <s> the south african element was in any event considered in the report and i would refer the noble lord to paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is of course quite right <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to your lordships for the reception that has been given to the order <e> <s> i will deal with a few of the points that have been raised because your lordships are doubtless anxious to get on to the next business <e>", "<cs> my lords i add my voice to those of other noble lords in thanking the noble lord lord molloy for raising this matter tonight <e> <s> the noble lords motion is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to accept that clarification <e> <s> there are indeed a large number of part-time staff as the noble lord recognises in the national health service <e> <s> indeed per cent <e> <s> of all employees are part-time providing about one-quarter of the services staffing resources <e> <s> but there is no evidence to suggest that employment of part-time staff on this scale is a cause of friction <e> <s> indeed their interests are strongly looked after by the trade unions active in the national health service <e>", "<cs> your lordships may forgive me if i do not follow the noble lord down that path <e> <s> he and i exchanged our views on that matter and matters related to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may deal first with the last of my noble friends supplementary questions <e> <s> i understand that the position is that the two cases that have come before the courts have in fact been referred back to the tribunals in order that additional reasons or grounds may be given <e> <s> so i do not think that it is correct to say as my noble friend suggests that the decisions have in fact been quashed <e> <s> turning to the first of my noble friends supplementary questions i certainly agree that it is desirable that people suffering from all types of handicap ought to have the best treatment support and care that we can provide <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble lords second question is yes <e> <s> as to the first of the noble lords questions we think that improvements to the system ought to be subsumed in a wider consideration of benefits available for disabled people and we shall do that as soon as resources are available <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right that the government see the way forward in this matter as producing a comprehensive system for disabled people including a simplified and modernised system of benefit for handicapped and disabled people of every kind <e> <s> we shall do that as i said in answer to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale as soon as the resources are available <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the existing system is in place and will continue until such time as we can produce a more comprehensive system as i have said <e> <s> but as the noble and learned lord will recall during the recent debate on this matter my noble and learned friend on the woolsack made it quite clear that the prime purpose of vaccination is not a public purpose but a purpose in the interests of the child itself <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right to put his finger on that point <e> <s> as it happens i was myself visiting the porton down establishment quite recently and saw the work that is being carried out in this particular field <e> <s> they have not yet reached the stage of being able to start clinical trials but i understand that they hope to be able to do so before too long <e>", "<cs> my lords no the risks of contracting brain damage are much greater for unvaccinated children than for those who undergo that treatment <e>", "<cs> my lords i sought to reply to my noble friend in a general way saying that we saw the case for the development of a more comprehensive system of benefit for disabled and handicapped people of every kind and i was not specifically thinking of the campaign of any particular pressure group <e>", "<cs> my lords it may now be for the convenience of the house if i repeat the answer to the private notice question being given in another place by my honourable friend mr clarke which same private notice question was tabled by the noble lord lord wallace of coslany a few moments ago <e> <s> the answer is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords to answer the noble lord lord wallace i can tell him these are not the latest figures but i think they are not far adrift that there are approximately patients on hospital haemodialysis in england on home dialysis on intermittent peritoneal dialysis and on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis <e> <s> those numbers as i say may be slightly out of date <e>", "<cs> i apologise for that omission my lords <e> <s> home dialysis patients generally speaking require a water supply of some lbs <e> <s> per square inch and about gallons per dialysis <e> <s> in general they need to be dialysed as the expression is two or three times a week depending on the extent of their disease <e> <s> in general water workers have regarded these as priority <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i entirely agree with my noble friend who speaks with particular knowledge and experience of the matter <e> <s> the offer currently before the workers in the water industry is for an average increase of about a week taking their average weekly pay to about <e> <s> reverting to the first of my noble friends points i would say that i fear that it is not possible indefinitely to take industrial action of this kind without affecting people in one way or another and of course the people whom we are discussing in particular the renal dialysis patients are likely to be the first to suffer <e>", "<cs> of course the government will do what they can to see that the proper arrangements are made in these circumstances but as the noble lord rightly points out transfer between distant hospitals for example in remote regions is more difficult <e> <s> that is why i would say that it is incumbent upon those working in the industry in wales for example to be particularly careful that they observe the agreement to which my noble friend referred which provides that they should take action to restore services in these situations even when they are in fact in dispute <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful first to the noble baroness lady jeger for clarifying what she seeks to achieve by virtue of this amendment <e> <s> the matters which she and others who have spoken have raised are of the greatest importance and as i shall explain are under urgent consideration by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to say at the outset that the intention behind the amendment is wholly admirable but i am afraid i have to say that the government think it would be inappropriate to include it in legislation <e> <s> the amendment embodies a principle of good child practice to which i am certain all social services departments subscribe <e> <s> but it is not easy to legislate for good professional practice and my noble friend recognises this because she has included the qualification as far as possible and practicable <e> <s> incidentally i am not quite certain that if ever the courts came to look at that particular clause they would find it easy to interpret <e>", "<cs> my lords if i have your lordships permission to speak again i should like to say that there is more than one concrete objection to this amendment as i endeavoured to point out in my remarks just now <e> <s> first there is the difficulty to which the noble lord lord wells-pestell referred namely the interpretation of the words <e>", "<cs> my lords assuming that no other noble lord wishes to intervene at this point and that i am therefore winding up this short debate on the amendment i would point out that the words which the noble lord does not like very much originally appeared in section of the social work scotland act <e> <s> i have in front of me section and in paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend has reminded your lordships she moved a similar amendment during committee <e> <s> since then she and i have met to discuss the matter she has discussed it with my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary at the department of education and science dr rhodes boyson and she has also discussed some of the technical details with my officials <e> <s> i applaud her tenacity but i am afraid that despite the account she has given your lordships nothing has emerged from these discussions which makes it possible for the government to support her amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may have permission to speak again i should like to say this <e> <s> the additional cost that would flow from my noble friends <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the house would allow me to intervene yet again <e> <s> is not my noble friend turning logic on its head in that particular proposal <e> <s> is it not the case that discretionary awards do go to the best applicants <e> <s> surely if grants are mandatory as my noble friend seeks the local education authority has no alternative but to give grants to all who meet the qualifications regardless of whether or not they are the best students <e>", "<cs> my lords the existing wording of the bill obliges the secretary of state to consult any body appearing to him appropriate before appointing members other than the chairman to the central council for education and training in social work <e>", "<cs> my lords if i have your lordships permission to speak again i would say with respect to my noble friend that i do not think the first point she made really arises on this amendment <e> <s> as for the second point i will consider that matter and write to her <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be of convenience to your lordships if i reply to the amendment of the noble baroness lady robson of kiddington now and we can then move to the discussion of the main amendment <e> <s> when this question was raised during the committee stage i said that we were examining just such a possibility as is proposed in these amendments <e> <s> i confirm that and can tell your lordships that we shall soon be consulting the various interests affected including representatives of both the registration authorities and those carrying on the homes <e> <s> among other things we shall be consulting on the form in which the list could be most effectively kept <e> <s> as i said before and the noble baroness recognised this is not a matter which requires legislation but we shall keep parliament informed of our intentions and i hope that the assurance will enable the noble baroness to withdraw her amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment which i have just moved includes at one point at least the essence of a recommendation which was made by the noble lord lord wallace of coslany at the committee stage <e> <s> naturally it was not possible to do that until today <e>", "<cs> my lords i come to the dispatch box always ready to listen to the advice of noble lords from all quarters of the house in particular those noble lords with experience both in parliament and in relation to these matters some of whom sit on the benches opposite <e> <s> i am grateful for the welcome which has been given to these amendments by my noble friend lord renton and other noble lords <e> <s> the noble lord lord kilmarnock drew my attention to what i understand was a printing error in the original marshalled list <e> <s> this error has since been corrected <e> <s> my noble friend lord renton also said that there were a number of errors of reference in schedule <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not quite clear whether those errors remained <e> <s> i am glad to hear they do not <e> <s> if they had remained i should have wished them to be put right <e> <s> i am grateful for your lordships reception of these amendments <e> <s> nothing further need i think be said <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> moved amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> my lords as i explained to your lordships when moving amendment no <e> <s> the new schedule a supersedes schedule <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> with your lordships agreement seeks to delete schedule <e> <s> i am happy to hear that the noble lord lord wallace of coslany may be prepared if i give him the right answer now to agree to the deletion of schedule <e> <s> i am further happy to say that group homes are indeed excluded from the provisions of the bill <e> <s> in the light of my assurance i hope the noble lord will not press this or the next amendment and will agree to the subsequent one <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i can cut short discussion on this amendment to the satisfaction of the noble lord lord kilmarnock by saying that i am willing to give the assurance for which he has asked <e>", "<cs> my lords listening to the remarks of the noble lord lord winstanley a certain apprehension crossed my brow to hear that there was some disagreement between him and the noble lord lord kilmarnock <e> <s> there will i suspect be no disagreement however between him and his noble friend if that is what i am to call them on the opening words of the noble lord lord kilmarnock when he said his party was deeply committed to health and prevention of disease <e> <s> i suspect that all political parties are committed to that admirable sentiment certainly mine is i am happy to hear that his is and no doubt also are the other parties represented in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords if i have your lordships permission to speak again i have advanced certain reasons why this amendment is not appropriate and i am grateful for the support of my noble friends who sit behind me qualified though it was in one respect <e> <s> however i must say that i think that in the light of what has been said perhaps it would be wise if i took this matter away and had another look at it <e> <s> i am not giving your lordships an undertaking to change what is proposed because we have already given this matter considerable thought and the product of that thought is contained in the provisions of the bill <e> <s> nevertheless <e>", "<cs> my lords if i still have your lordships permission to speak again i am naturally happy to receive the noble lord lord kilmarnock at any time <e> <s> i am not sure that my room in the department is big enough to receive all the noble lords who have spoken in this debate but certainly if he wishes to bring other noble lords with him <e> <s> i would not for a moment object <e> <s> perhaps we can therefore proceed on that basis <e>", "<cs> my lords paragraph a <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a thoroughly good idea <e> <s> i accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord molloy urged me to consider that we should reduce bureaucracy in the nhs and improve its efficiency and that is a sentiment with which i entirely agree <e> <s> indeed in the nearly four years we have had responsibility for these matters we have moved a long way in that direction <e> <s> we have removed one whole layer of bureaucracy from the nhs and we have taken particular care to see that the regions and districts now operate at the best level of efficiency they can attain <e> <s> we have regional reviews with each region conducted on an annual basis and we have all sorts of other matters which we press on regions and districts to which they are responding admirably <e>", "<cs> my lords if i have your lordships permission to speak again i would say that i am sorry that i did not cover the point that my noble friend raised <e> <s> i fear it is the case that there will be a very large number of hospitals which think that they ought to be included in the new special arrangements to which i have referred <e> <s> i have no doubt that many of them will have a very powerful case for inclusion <e> <s> however the fact of the matter is that if overnight we included all these hospitals in the special arrangement to which i have referred the benefit of that special arrangement would disappear at the same time because by its very nature it needs to be selective <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord wallace of coslany i will speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and which deal specifically with the scottish dimension and amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> in part these amendments are similar in intention to the amendments which the noble lord and the noble baroness moved to this clause in committee <e> <s> i leave aside the scottish amendments because that is not so in regard to them <e> <s> at that stage they were seeking to relieve people on low incomes and with small capital resources from local authority charges for the services that they need <e> <s> subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords these two amendments deal with a rather different point but i am afraid that the government do not accept that they are desirable <e> <s> indeed amendment no <e> <s> would be contrary to the intention to simplify procedures and charging policy would increase the administrative costs to scottish local authorities and reduce the flexibility which seems both sensible and appropriate given the scope of services covered by section of act <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already said we are currently discussing the implementation of the proposals on charging in the bill with the local authority associations <e> <s> i have also explained that similar consultations are being held between the scottish office and the convention of scottish local authorities <e> <s> both sets of consultations include the question of guidance to local authorities on the recovery of charges for their day and domiciliary services <e> <s> i still think it would be preferable if such guidance were prepared by the local authority associations themselves rather than by the respective secretaries of state and i would not want to prevent such a development by agreeing to this amendment before the outcome of the consultations was clear <e> <s> should the associations conclude that they cannot provide guidance it may be necessary to prepare such guidance centrally <e>", "<cs> and so may i for all that <e> <s> however i hear that the consultation is at least continuing and while it is continuing there is certainly hope that it will be satisfactorily concluded <e> <s> in the light of that consultation and in the light of the admittedly minor difficulties to which i have referred i hope that the noble lord will see fit to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as always i find myself lost in admiration for the advocacy of the noble lord lord wallace of coslany <e> <s> i am happy to accept amendment no <e> <s> but not i fear the others to which he spoke <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for interrupting but this is rather an important point <e> <s> will the noble baroness lady jeger be good enough to read out the subsequent sentence in the written answer i gave to her question <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will forgive me if i do not follow my noble friend half across the world to australia to discuss the benefits to the travel industry of the arrangements that operate in that country <e> <s> as i have said previously during committee stage and again today subsection was introduced to ensure that the definition of assets for the purposes of these recovery provisions was the same as in the statutory provisions which govern local authorities charging procedures <e> <s> in other words the provisions of this clause can operate only where a local authority has decided in the course of making an assessment of charges that the resident concerned has deliberately divested himself of a relevant asset <e> <s> without the limitations of this subsection the recovery provisions of this clause could operate on any asset of which a resident may have deprived himself whether or not that asset had been taken into account by the authority when assessing his ability to pay for the accommodation <e> <s> i should like to underline the point therefore that we are narrowing the range of assets that could be taken into account for this purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords i told the noble baroness in the earlier written answer to which she referred that we have no record of the power being used certainly not recently <e> <s> i think the power may well have a deterrent effect <e> <s> that does not refer to the old people themselves because i readily accept that per cent <e> <s> of old people are not concerned with divesting themselves of assets for this improper purpose <e> <s> what i fear is the case of an old person perhaps confused and sadly on the point of going into a home being leaned upon by an unscrupulous relative or close friends to divest himself of assets perhaps to the friends or relative themselves <e> <s> that is what we are seeking to prevent and i hope therefore that your lordships will agree that these measures should proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the governments policy in relation to tribunals of the nature of social security appeal tribunals that only individuals with appropriate professional legal qualifications who have a certain standing should be appointed as chairmen <e> <s> at present with one exception and i fancy that that is the one who wrote to the noble baroness all chairmen of national insurance local tribunals are barristers advocates or solicitors and following a recommendation by professor bell qualified lawyers are appointed as chairmen of supplementary benefit appeal tribunals wherever possible <e> <s> the case for having legally qualified chairmen to consider supplementary benefit appeals has also been strengthened by the change to a regulated scheme <e> <s> we have consulted the lord chancellors departments about what qualifications to require for social security appeal tribunal chairmen and we think that the professional legal qualifications specified in the bill are an appropriate minimum <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may speak again on this matter i suspect that the five years that he served as a practising barrister before he went into academic life would enable him to be qualified for these appointments <e> <s> i speak off the top of my head and it may be wrong but if it is wrong i shall write to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i wholly agree with my noble friend about the question of quantity rather than quality <e> <s> i think that the quality of social workers is of course very important and is very high <e> <s> as to numbers there has been a significant increase in numbers in the past few years not sufficient perhaps to meet the aspirations of everyone concerned with these matters but or so more social workers are now in post than was the case three or four years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords the recommendations of the barclay report itself are doubtless well known to the noble lord <e> <s> we take different attitudes to different recommendations some of them appeal to us more than others <e> <s> for example there is one particular recommendation about community social work which we think is very attractive while some of the others are less attractive <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that the barclay report did not concern itself with affairs in scotland <e> <s> if i am wrong i shall let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said to the noble lord just now i am not entirely clear whether the barclay report which is the subject of the question on the order paper concerned itself with affairs in scotland and that was the matter to which i addressed my reply <e> <s> i shall make further inquiries about that and let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> my lords some of the barclay report recommendations one important one in particular will certainly need legislation although that is not the case with all of the recommendations <e> <s> if the noble lord would like to know which ones would and which ones would not i shall be happy to let him know that too <e>", "<cs> yes certainly <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> the effect of this amendment would be to give the general dental council unlimited scope to debar from registration and dental practice any particular category of graduates or licentiates of united kingdom dental authorities as the council may determine <e> <s> in so far as the amendment could permit a future council to erect unreasonable barriers your lordships will i am sure agree that it is too far-reaching <e> <s> in so far as the present council would not wish to use the additional power in present circumstances but might as my noble friend has indicated make use of it only to impose a postgraduate pre-registration training requirement upon new dentists when the necessary facilities were available when the way was clear and the time was judged to be right the underlying principle is not so far removed from government thinking <e>", "<cs> i am tempted to reply by saying that therefore this might be a matter for the dentists bill of but i am not able to foreshadow the queens speech of that year and so i hope your lordships will forgive me if i do not do so <e> <s> as my noble friend said in moving this amendment it seeks to delete from section of the dentists act the existing statutory restrictions on the titles and descriptions which dentists may use and particularly the requirement that the related qualification must be held by the dentist before he uses the title and provides instead that dentists may not use titles or descriptions other than those the use of which has been approved by the general dental council <e> <s> the amendment abolishes the provision for a penalty for contravening restrictions on the use of titles and descriptions <e>", "<cs> two points have been put to me by my noble friend <e> <s> first she asked me to justify the position in other countries <e> <s> i am not sure that it is my duty at this box to seek to justify the arrangements that pertain in other countries but i suppose it is fair to say that patients or would-be patients who live in other countries have come to recognise that although their dentist calls himself a doctor he is probably not one and they make allowances accordingly <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that this is a very profitable line of discussion <e> <s> nonetheless i would say that over the years people in this country have come to recognise that a dentist calls himself a doctor only when he has a doctorate in dentistry which is of course a much higher qualification <e> <s> if dentists who had doctorates in for example music were allowed to call themselves doctor it would indeed be misleading <e>", "<cs> the principal difficulty in what my noble friend proposes is that there are some perfectly respectable qualifications offered by overseas institutions for example certain american institu <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend has indicated the effect of this amendment is to make a minor alteration to section of the dentists act <e> <s> this at present provides for the general dental council making regulations prescribing appropriate titles which may be used by dentists practising in any special branch of dentistry if that special branch has in the councils opinion become so distinctive that the use of such titles would be for the convenience of the public or the profession <e> <s> the amendment would leave the section referring to any branch of dentistry which had become so distinctive rather than to any special branch of dentistry which had become so distinctive <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that it is right to describe this procedure as a summary procedure as my noble friend did <e> <s> the disciplinary committee of the gdc would move in this way only after the most careful consideration of the circumstances <e> <s> my noble friend lord colwyn referred to a very unfortunate recent case in which a particular dentist was convicted of manslaughter after a tragic event in his surgery subsequently appealed against that conviction and was permitted to continue to practise while that appeal was under consideration <e> <s> that is a circumstance that we shall need to look at carefully in the light of whatever decision is subsequently reached by the courts in that matter <e> <s> naturally i offer no view as to the merits or otherwise of that particular case <e> <s> this is a very rare situation i trust and my noble friend lord colwyn confirms that <e> <s> it is not likely to happen i should think more than once or at the most twice a year <e> <s> certainly that is the historical position as i understand it <e>", "<cs> as i explained to my noble friend earlier this is of course a much faster procedure than the one that presently exists <e> <s> i described the circumstances surrounding a certain case which could not be acted upon at anything like the speed that was perhaps desirable because of the need to hear the conclusion of the legal proceedings and other matters before the general councils disciplinary committee could act <e> <s> here the disciplinary committee can hear the facts themselves reach a decision and order immediate suspension if they think fit <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord colwyn is not quite right about that because amendment no <e> <s> refers to suspension on grounds of health whereas this is suspension on disciplinary grounds <e> <s> suspension of a dentist following full investigation and direction of the disciplinary committee is intended to have more in common with erasure from the register than with admonition <e> <s> the distinctive point about suspension is that restoration to the register after a maximum of months suspension is automatic but suspension still denotes conviction of a criminal offence or guilt of serious professional misconduct which the disciplinary committe considers to be grave enough to warrant the loss of livelihood which would inevitably follow <e> <s> if the committe finds the dentist guilty or notes a criminal conviction it will as has been the case in the past be quite open to the committee to administer a warning and not direct the more severe measure of erasure or suspension <e> <s> i am quite sure that the committee is fully aware of the potential effects of its decisions and will continue to warn dentists whose misdeeds do not call for stronger action <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is quite mistaken about that <e> <s> if she is looking for a parallel to a suspended sentence she must think in terms of a reprimand or admonition <e>", "<cs> under the dentists act there is nothing to prevent a registered medical practitioner undertaking the practice of dentistry and there is equally nothing to prevent a registered dentist giving advice to such a practitioner so the amendment is not necessary <e> <s> but i understand my noble friend now accepts the defects in the drafting and would prefer me to address my remarks to the general principle of dentists offering advice to para-medics working on oil rigs <e> <s> my noble friend is right to say that under the present law it is not possible for dentists to do that because under various other aspects of our legislation <e>", "<cs> the same arguments apply to this and the same difficulties emerge as they did on the earlier amendment <e> <s> i hope therefore that my noble friend will not wish to pursue the matter <e>", "<cs> section of the dentists act enables the committee to treat as conclusive in their disciplinary inquiries a finding in the high court in the united kingdom or the republic of ireland or in the court of session that a dentist has been guilty of adultery <e> <s> we accept that the overwhelming majority of divorce cases now take place in the county courts rather than in the high court and that thus section referring only to the high court or court of session is effectively obsolete as it stands <e>", "<cs> my lords the health issues were not matters for the director-general but will in due course be matters for my department <e> <s> we shall consult widely on those and reach our conclusions in due course <e> <s> as to the other matters which the noble lord has raised they were certainly well within the remit of the director-general and of course they will come within the ambit of the wider review that we have already announced and will no doubt be incorporated in any changes which we may in due course bring forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that some of the observations of the director-general with regard to competition in this particular industry give very substantial food for thought and the government will certainly move forward in this matter just as quickly as we can <e> <s> it is now barely a month since the report was published and i hardly think that your lordships could reasonably expect that i should be announcing proposals today <e>", "<cs> my lords that is another view which we shall certainly want to take into account <e>", "<cs> my lords that depends on whether other people are right or not <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give a precise indication of how long this consultation will take but i can say that my right honourable friend will be consulting very widely on this matter including all the relevant interested parties <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot say without taking advice whether monocles are available under the national health service but i will certainly find out and write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords the noble lord is quite right to say that people concerned with these matters are among the very best in the world in their field <e> <s> the question that arises from this report and from the views of your lordships who have put questions to me today is whether these high skills are in every case necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i can certainly assure my noble friend that there will be no unnecessary delay in the consultations which we are about to conduct and that we will bring forward our proposals just as soon as we can <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot bind my honourable friend to receive a deputation without asking him <e> <s> but i am certainly willing to receive a deputation brought by the noble lord or any other noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a number of different types of qualifications involved in this profession and it might be unduly trespassing upon your lordships patience if i were to describe them all now <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i am wholly in order in speaking at this particular juncture <e> <s> my noble friend has put a specific point <e> <s> the answer to my noble friend as shortly as i can put it is that the title was devised to reflect the contents of the bill and needless to say i must take my share of the responsibility for that <e>", "<cs> my lords if i am in order to speak again i hope i am may i say in answer to my noble friend lord renton that i remember that my noble friend was concerned at an earlier stage about the particular point he has just raised and indeed tabled an amendment in that connection <e> <s> i forget quite what happened to the amendment i have a feeling that it was not moved <e>", "<cs> well my lords my noble friend must have had good reasons fo <e> <s> that <e> <s> as for the point put to me by the noble lord lord wallace i recognise that some of these matters have come forward at a very late stage <e> <s> one of the difficulties we have had to overcome in regard to this third reading is that the report stage had to be delayed for a week because we needed to accommodate the debate on the franks report <e> <s> that telescoped the time between that stage and this <e> <s> this has made matters a little awkward for some noble lords <e> <s> i apologise if i have in any way contributed to that difficulty <e> <s> despite that problem and i remember that the noble lord raised a similar point before the last stage i have done my best to approach in a constructive and helpful spirit all amendments tabled by noble lords on all sides of your lordships house <e> <s> i think i have accepted more amendments than i have ever done before when handling a government bill from this box and that i hope is a reflection of the constructive approach the government bring to these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i am going to speak from my heart rather than from my brief and no doubt that is very unwise <e> <s> i feel strongly indeed that in the past we have been too ready to single out handicapped or disabled children as some sort of breed apart which i strongly believe they are not <e> <s> they are children just as any other child whether they have the misfortune to be handicapped or the misfortune to be disabled <e> <s> it is certainly the governments view that amendment no <e> <s> which i shall come to shortly is designed to affect every child whether he or she be handicapped whether he or she be disabled or whether he or she be mercifully fit <e> <s> i hope the noble baroness will accept my assurance that that is most certainly the governments intention <e>", "<cs> my lords they go into care <e>", "<cs> my lords i propose to reply to this amendment in due course after other noble lords have spoken at some length <e> <s> your lordships may think that it is therefore now appropriate to take the first statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i am tempted to answer the noble baroness first but i will not <e> <s> i am not sure that the noble baroness participated in all our discussions on this particular point at earlier stages of the bill <e> <s> i think that she did so on some of them <e> <s> she may recall that i referred to the preparation of regulations which will follow the enactment of this clause if that is what your lordships decide <e> <s> i must say that i was somewhat puzzled when i first saw this amendment on the marshalled list because the subject has been debated by your lordships at considerable length on two occasions already <e> <s> on the last occasion the noble lord lord wallace of coslany expressed himself well content with the governments acceptance of his amendment no <e> <s> to subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords in the previous debate on this clause a week ago the noble lord expressed himself as being blinded by science with the introduction of the amended provisions which we are now considering <e> <s> it seems from the noble lords remarks that his objection to these provisions may be based upon a misunderstanding <e> <s> i will endeavour to clarify what we propose and i hope thus to be able to set the noble lords mind at rest <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not certain that my noble friends point arises on this amendment but i shall write to her <e>", "<cs> my lords in deciding that the secretary of state shall appoint vice-chairmen of fpcs the government had in mind two considerations <e> <s> the first was to ensure that the long-established balance between contractor and non-contractor membership of the committee should he reflected in the appointment of chairmen and vice-chairmen that is to say that one should be drawn from one group and the other from the other group <e> <s> the second was that where a potential chairman is identified it should be possible for the secretary of state if he chooses to ensure that that person can gain further experience by a spell as vice-chairman of a committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i think there is a misapprehension in the mind of the noble baroness and possibly some other noble lords on this matter <e> <s> i should like to emphasise that the governments intention is only to seek power so as to be able to use one doctor to carry out an examination where this makes sense <e> <s> it is quite definitely not the aim to adopt the single doctor examination procedure in every case <e> <s> it is a fact that many examinations are concerned with straightforward medical issues and in the large majority of cases result in assessment of per cent <e> <s> disablement or less and involve award of a gratuity of about <e> <s> as i have mentioned it is not the intention to use single doctor examination automatically but to introduce flexibility <e> <s> indeed it is planned to continue to use two medical practitioners <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to move that the bill do now pass <e> <s> may i first express my thanks to all members of your lordships house who have taken part in the various debates on the bill as it has passed through its stages <e> <s> it is always helpful to have the benefit of the wisdom and experience assembled in your lordships house and this bill has been no exception in that respect <e> <s> proposals put forward by noble lords on both sides of the house have been incorporated in the bill and i believe the bill is now significantly improved since the time it first appeared in your lordships house three months ago <e> <s> the credit for that must rest with your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said the steering group will have on it members of the four voluntary organisations that have been dealing with these matters up until now and will be advising on the creation of a new voluntary organisation <e> <s> i think it would be a mistake for the steering group to be steered which is what i think the noble lord is suggesting <e> <s> it is the government who are themselves expecting to be steered <e> <s> we are of course providing a secretary for the steering group but the question of what matters they consider is for them and not for the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not wish to preclude the steering group from suggesting anything <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that the four existing bodies with one exception i believe have been by and large funded from central government sources up until now <e> <s> i have no doubt that the new body when it comes to be established will similarly rely to a considerable extent on central government funding <e> <s> i certainly accept that the points the noble lord has raised are important and i would imagine that the steering group will bring forward proposals in connection with them <e>", "<cs> my lords as indicated in the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer could undoubtedly have been framed in a number of different ways but i doubt whether any of them would have satisfied the noble lord <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the department has been considering the working of the regional economic policy but ministers have yet to decide what further work will be necessary <e> <s> i am afraid that it is too early to say when such work will be ready <e>", "<cs> my lords the principal reduction to which the noble lord referred namely the reduction in regional development grants as foreshadowed for as compared with arises of course because of a difference in the method of payment which took place last year when effectively months payments were dispensed in just one year <e> <s> naturally therefore when we resume the standard years issue for the sum will be rather less <e> <s> but on the wider point that the <e>", "<cs> absolutely not my lords <e> <s> as the noble lord will recall when we considered the provisions of the aircraft and shipbuilding legislation a session or so ago i was at pains to explain then that the provisions of the industry act remain in place <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord and i and indeed i think my noble friend lord belstead have discussed the question of the brandt report <e>", "<cs> vaccine damage tribunals are independent adjudicating authorities and it would be inappropriate for me to comment on their decisions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to have to tell my noble friend that the act to which she referred was passed in not <e> <s> the act provides for the codification of the range of by-laws which may be made under the original act <e> <s> i have to tell my noble friend that in recent years very many of the by-laws have been brought into line to comply with the suggestion which our predecessors made in the circular which they issued on so i am not sure that bringing that act into force is as urgent as my noble friend suggests <e> <s> as for the regularisation codification or even consolidation of the legislation that is as my noble friend said a matter for others rather than for myself but i shall certainly bring it to the attention of those concerned <e> <s> there are at least four statutes concerned with this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of these facilities is to enable argentina to meet her debts as they fall due and the imf support programme of course has a number of conditions attached to it <e> <s> as the noble lord will recall it is not customary to reveal the details of those conditions <e> <s> i can say however that the conditions are pretty stringent but i hope your lordships will agree that it would not have been in the interests of the international banking community and above all of this country for argentina to have defaulted on her obligations with all the consequences which might have flowed from that <e>", "<cs> my lords i do of course agree with my noble friend <e> <s> as i have said a number of conditions were attached to the imf support programme of which the bank facilities to which i referred form a part <e> <s> those restrictions are quite severe and will no doubt at least curtail argentinian ambitions if they have any <e>", "<cs> my lords i can say quite clearly that that is not the purpose for which the money was provided <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord bruce of donington knows the negotiations which go on at the board of the imf and at which the united kingdom is represented are confidential <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that the terms are very strict and i doubt very much whether the argentinians will have much in the way of spare cash for the sort of military adventures which he fears <e> <s> i might add that if support had not been provided for argentinian debt repayment purposes in these circumstances presumably they would have defaulted on their obligations not only on their obligations to us but on their wider obligations to the world banking community in general and that would have released substantially more funds for the purposes which the noble lord and i both deplore <e>", "<cs> my lords those items were not included in the figures to which i was referring but they are matters which are enjoying the governments consideration at this time <e>", "<cs> my lords the banks are free agents in this matter and it is not for the government to direct them or to forbid them to take part in these arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords that is theoretically possible but the practise of the matter is that the argentinians now have to control their monetary policy in a much tighter way than they did before which will certainly restrict the funds available for this purpose <e> <s> in any event as i said just now if these arrangements had not been agreed substantially greater sums would have been available <e>", "<cs> my lords the banks are of course entitled to conduct their operations in accordance with the legal framework that exists at the time <e> <s> there were up until recently as the noble lord will recall restrictions upon the financial arrangements between our two countries <e> <s> these have now been lifted and only trade restrictions remain <e> <s> while the financial framework of legislation permits the banks to conduct this business there is no reason for the government to step in <e>", "<cs> my lords i always come to your lordships house as well prepared as i can be to answer the supplementary questions put before me <e> <s> the difficulty with the technique adopted by my noble friend is that other noble lords may not be quite familiar with what my noble friend has in mind <e> <s> i think he is concerned about the position of the possum users association which is a body which provides assistance to disabled people through the medium of certain types of device <e> <s> it is the case that my department does support that association but not specifically for the purposes of a welfare officer as my noble friend may imagine <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to hear that some of the local authority social workers are not up to the standard that my noble friend thinks appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords i was rather addressing my reply to the welfare officers employed by the possum users association which i know was in the mind of my noble friend lord milverton when he asked the question and the sort of social workers who might attend people who would otherwise have the benefit of the officers from that association <e> <s> certainly the government fully appreciate the importance and the need for these officers to be of the highest possible grade <e> <s> that is why we make available assistance to the sort of association my noble friend has in mind <e> <s> but in general we tend to channel our funds which are of course limited towards the central administration of these organisations because that is the activity which they have the most difficulty in funding from the public subscription <e>", "<cs> my lords the list of organisations supported by my department is if i remember rightly about names long <e> <s> a written answer was given in another place listing the organisations that we assist and i will see whether i can draw my noble friends attention precisely to that written answer <e>", "<cs> i certainly agree my lords but that does not quite arise from this question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> lord rochester for his constructive and helpful response to the statement <e> <s> we shall certainly wish to consult effectively with the staff side as with the others whose views we shall be taking <e> <s> we shall of course go into that consultation with an open mind ready to consider most carefully the views that they will wish to put to us <e>", "<cs> my lords it is our view that by removing the constraints which some authorities have felt themselves under thus far from putting their contracts out to tender we are indeed removing an ideological constraint that is presently upon them <e> <s> now they are going to have the choice either to go to a private contractor or if this appears to be more economic to go to an in-house service <e>", "<cs> my lords you would not believe it to look at the noble baroness lady jeger but a little while has elapsed since she was working in the health service and i must tell her that some of the things she talked about have to a certain extent moved on since then <e> <s> the principal areas we are talking about in this statement catering domestic services and laundry are now essentially separately organised and are certainly separately costed or should be by and large within the health service <e> <s> that is why we considered it appropriate to move forward with this particular area <e> <s> secondly there are in any event well-established firms able to consider taking on these services in appropriate cases <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we want to see the in-house catering laundry or cleaning organisations tendering on precisely the same terms as the commercial firms who make their proposals <e> <s> that means of course that concerning the other tenderers the tender will be confidential <e> <s> the purpose of the budgetary control to which i referred is that if the in-house service is the successful tenderer in a particular case then they will be obliged to adhere to their successful tender as a budget for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords as usual the perspicacity of my noble friend knows no bounds <e> <s> there was no need for me to bring forward a government amendment on this matter because my noble friends amendment deals with it quite well <e> <s> i am happy to accept both this amendment and amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords this is really a matter for the general dental council <e> <s> i understand that they do not accept the dds qualification for registration because it is a primary qualification equivalent to our bds or lds <e> <s> if the gdc registered it under present arrangements then dentists with that qualification will be able to call themselves doctor in this country <e> <s> the gdc believe as do the government that that would be misleading <e> <s> this was along the lines of the arguments i deployed at an earlier stage of the bill <e> <s> i believe that the primary court of inquiry for my noble friend is the gdc and doubtless he will be better able than i to convey his thoughts to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt in my mind that the procedures we are here providing for are the right procedures <e> <s> the sort of circumstances my noble friend has in mind are those where the gdc conclude that the interests of the patients demand that the dentist ceases to treat them more of less forthwith <e> <s> i am certain that is the right way to proceed in this context <e> <s> my noble friend raises a proper point when she refers to the need of the patients to be able to secure alternative dental treatment should they need it <e> <s> some of them may be in the middle of a course of treatment of some sort and some may need treatment for other reasons <e> <s> it seems to me that the patients in those circumstances could be assigned to another dentist in the locality pretty readily and i have no doubt that is what the fpc would seek to do <e> <s> however my noble friend raises a real point and perhaps i could consider it further and write to her at a later time <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not recall writing to the noble lord in the terms he suggests <e> <s> it certainly was not recently <e> <s> of course i answered the question on the order paper and not any correspondence that he may have sent to me <e> <s> as for the question on the order paper there are general purpose scanners available in the national health service <e> <s> about of those are advanced machines capable of the high resolution technique to which he refers <e> <s> in addition some of the earlier generation have attachments which enable them to perform high resolution scans <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so the noble lord is living proof of the merits of this equipment but perhaps i should say that it is nonetheless rather expensive as much as which in the case of the noble lord is clearly money well spent <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is referring to the st bartholomews case and there was a recent press report about it then i must say that that consultant is mistaken also <e>", "<cs> yes of course my lords the government wholly agree with the suggestion that there should be a free exchange of services of this kind in particular if i may say so in connection with very expensive facilities such as this where sometimes it is not justified for both the private sector and the national health service to have facilities side by side in similar areas <e> <s> that is in fact what happened in the st bartholomews case to which the noble lord lord plant referred though i can also say that st bartholomews is planning to install one of these machines later this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have those figures in front of me but i shall see whether i can find them and advise the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said just now there are already more than of these machines in this <e>", "<cs> my lords there are three reasons why i am so pleased to be standing here tonight to reply to the debate <e> <s> first it gives me a chance to express the governments view of the report which the committee under the noble lord lord kings norton has so magnificently produced <e> <s> secondly it has given me a chance to listen to the galaxy of talent which the debate has brought forward talent both academic and industrial and last but by no means least it has given all your lordships the chance to hear for the first time my noble friend lord hood in making his maiden speech <e> <s> i believe i speak for all your lordships when i say that it was a great pleasure and privilege to listen to my noble friend <e> <s> i hope that we shall hear from him again soon and often <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their response to this bill <e> <s> my noble friend lord colwyn asked me a specific question <e> <s> that matter is under consideration and indeed i am on the point of writing to my noble friend about it <e> <s> with that assurance <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will give this bill a third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords we have heard two interesting speeches this afternoon <e> <s> i accept that if i caught him right the noble viscount lord simon does not find himself wholly in accord perhaps with the timing of the bill rather than the content <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce of donington spent the greater part of his very long speech dwelling on one particular matter which as i think he would agree does not specifically arise from the bill that we are considering this afternoon <e> <s> but i do not complain about that because he was certainly entitled to raise the point and i listened very carefully to what he had to say <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right that the sum of money anticipated is of the order of the figure that she mentioned <e> <s> certainly it is one of the purposes of the inquiry to ensure that we get the very best value for money <e> <s> there are others too such as the ones that i described in the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords nobody underestimates the importance of the point that the noble lord makes but of course there is other machinery for determining the conditions of work <e> <s> for example there is the review board for doctors and dentists and the whitley council machinery for the other workers in the health service <e> <s> i do not think that it would be right to expand the inquiry that i have referred to in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that the noble baroness is quite right to put her question in that way if i may say so <e> <s> it is very easy to criticise the national health service but we hear compliments less often <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of how the team seizes itself of the problems that it is to consider is a matter for the inquiry team itself <e> <s> i cannot say whether it will be visiting all the regions or indeed any although doubtless it will be visiting some <e> <s> as for the time-scale we hope to get a preliminary assessment of the way things are going towards the end of june and i cannot say quite how long it will take after that if at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly see no reason why not <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> this inquiry will particularly address itself to the problems of england but the conclusions which it reaches will of course be made available by my right honourable friend to his colleagues responsible for the other regions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i have to tell my noble friend that she really is not correct in her assertion that there has been a massive increase in administrative staff within the national health service <e> <s> on the contrary there has been a reduction in grades in the particular area in recent times <e> <s> but my noble friend might care to ponder on this particular point is it really right for example that an experienced and highly trained specialist should spend his time typing his own letters when it might be better if someone was employed for the purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords may i in answer to the last point suggest that the noble lord consults the noble baroness lady gaitskell who i think took a slightly different view on that matter than the noble lord now advances <e> <s> my lords the inquiry will of course be separate to the other matters that the noble lord referred to <e> <s> the purpose of the inquiry will be to enable my right honourable friend to implement the recommendations that it makes to improve the management efficiency and above all the value for money that we get out of the health service <e> <s> the inquiry has no relation whatever with any privatisation proposals as the noble lord said <e> <s> as for cost the four members of the inquiry are giving their services free of charge <e>", "<cs> my lords the inquiry will not be specifically concerned with the matter to which my noble friend refers because as i said it is concerned with the management of the health service and the value for money considerations to which i referred earlier <e> <s> but of course it will not be debarred from considering those particular problems with the sector to which my noble friend referred <e>", "<cs> my lords naturally i agree that the primary purpose of the national health service is to provide the care that sick people need <e> <s> the purpose of this inquiry is to assist us in doing that better <e>", "<cs> my lords it will certainly not be disbarred from looking at that matter if it wishes to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords it is unhappily the case that the waiting lists for non-emergency treatment which i gather is the cause of the difficulty with which the noble lord is faced are longer than we would wish <e> <s> up to the beginning of the dispute last year we had succeeded in significantly reducing those waiting lists but naturally as a result of the dispute they again lengthened <e> <s> i hope that one of the results of this inquiry will be that improved management efficiency in the health service will emerge which will again assist us in reducing the lengths of the waiting lists <e>", "<cs> order <e>", "<cs> my lords that is what makes it so remarkable that we have been able to achieve that performance in spite of the difficulties that i have described <e> <s> we need a framework which provides room for growth in real demand while establishing conditions which allow inflation to fall <e> <s> that framework is provided by the medium-term financial strategy and by the detailed measures that we are taking to improve incentives and make markets work more effectively <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend is referring to the charges experienced by nationalised industries with regard to the goods and services which they have to purchase then that figure i think was about per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords the increases which i have referred to stem to some considerable extent from the effects of price restraints in these industries in past years and they also reflect some of the pay settlements which have been reached in nationalised industries in recent years as well <e>", "<cs> my lords the reasons why we thought that to be necessary have been discussed in your lordships house on more than one occasion <e> <s> if the noble lord will remember i said that that was because the price of gas had been kept artificially low for a number of years and that indeed is still the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i would have to take some advice on what the effect would have been on the price index <e> <s> the noble lord will be aware that the calculation of the retail price index is not a simple straightforward matter but i can tell him that gas is weighted to the extent of per cent <e> <s> in that calculation <e>", "<cs> my lords as for the european position to which the noble lord referred in the first part of that supplementary social security schemes vary greatly from one country to another and what is appropriate or right in one country may not necessarily be so in another <e> <s> as for the question of the lower earnings limit it is the case that some volunteers overseas earn less than a week which means that they are not eligible to make class contributions and that being so they are not entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords i imagine that the arrangements to which the noble lord refers would comply with the three principal conditions relating to class contributions and thus people working under those schemes would be eligible for unemployment benefit when they return to this country <e> <s> perhaps i could write to the noble lord with the principal details so that he can clarify that matter in his mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly would not wish to have a closed mind on this matter and would be very willing to listen to any representation the noble lord would like to make to me <e> <s> but the three priincipal conditions to which i referred are well known and understood and it would be difficult to create a class of volunteer who received preferential treatment compared for example with volunteers working in very similar circumstances in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the coins will appreciate in value on the collectors market after they have been issued but i am referring of course to these commemorative issues <e> <s> as to the other point that my noble friend makes i should tell your lordships that i have a pound in my pocket <e> <s> there it is and i hope it will not be confused with anything <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord likes to send me his order with his cheque i shall be happy to see that he gets one <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that neither the fund nor central banks have any plans to restore gold to a formal position in the international monetary system <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i wholly agree with the noble lord <e> <s> certainly there is some room for improvement within the international monetary system but i fancy that a better way forward would be towards the development of the special drawing right system perhaps tying the special drawing right to a basket of international currencies <e> <s> there are real genuine difficulties in the way of bringing gold back to the role that the noble lord suggests not least the difficulty of reaching agreement as to the price at which that should be and not least the point that i am not certain that there is sufficient gold in the world for the purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that the noble lord is right in his cause-and-effect analysis <e> <s> the way forward as we see it is for the principal trading nations of the world to follow prudent and sound economic policies <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that the way forward is by the creation of a store of value as the <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord boothby certainly deserves an a for effort <e>", "<cs> my lords there is undoubtedly some strength in what the noble lord says <e> <s> south african gold supplies are already very much integrated into the world monetary system but that is certainly not the case as far as the soviet union is concerned who are indeed major gold producers <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i agree with that <e> <s> i think that if one looks at the difficulties in latin america for example which have occurred recently and i am thinking of mexico and brazil certainly the international monetary community if that is the right phrase have done a splendid job in preventing what could have been very serious difficulties in that part of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords the observation of the noble lord lord boothby if i may say so is a lesson of how wrong it is to try to prepare our arrangements for this year based on the experiences of perhaps years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble baronesss second supplementary question is yes <e> <s> we are as a matter of principle anyway prepared to make single payments for the purpose the noble baroness describes <e> <s> as to her first point the reason for the difference in these rates is that it was thought anomalous that a single homeless person who had no contribution to make to household expenses should receive a higher rate of benefit than people who are living in and contributing to a friend or relatives household <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that that is what the noble baroness was asking but i was explaining why it was we thought that in general they should get less than persons in other circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly look into the problem which the noble earl raises particularly if he would like to draw a particular case to my attention <e>", "<cs> my lords those who are likely or are about to incur the sort of costs the noble lord refers to are as i said to the noble baroness just now entitled to a single payment to enable them to do that <e> <s> the diffculty particularly in some urban areas very often is to find the accommodation they require <e> <s> the responsibility for the provision of accommodation for homeless people rests in general with local authorities but my department does have responsiblity for what are called resettlement units <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the particular case to which my noble friend referred i understand that the consultant was fully aware that the kind of treatment which the parents appeared to prefer was available in the united kingdom but it was the parents themselves who chose to have their child treated in the united states as of course they were absolutely entitled to do <e> <s> as for the second point which my noble friend raised about liaison between doctors and these facilities it is of course open to consultants to refer a patient to a particular hospital where he knows a particular kind of treatment is available even if that hospital is outside the region within which the consultant happens to work <e> <s> as for the general availability of these facilities to which my noble friend referred as i said in my original answer there are already quite a number <e> <s> more are certainly planned but this is principally a matter for the regions and the districts <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot claim that these facilities are available in each and every region <e> <s> there are two regions at present which do not have these facilities but in both cases they are planning to acquire them within the reasonably near future <e> <s> as for the even spread of these facilities i have to give an unsatisfactory answer to the noble lord it is not perfect at present <e> <s> that is why it is possible for consultants to refer patients to other facilities outside their region <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a rather different problem <e> <s> when the noble baroness lady masham of ilton referred to that matter she was thinking of hospitals which might perhaps be unique in the national health service being the only places in the country which can provide a particular service or perhaps one of just two or three <e> <s> as i said in my original answer there are at least of these facilities in the national health service <e> <s> therefore the kind of problems which the noble baroness described do not apply <e>", "<cs> my lords in the national health service it is of course necessary to use the funds that we can make available in the best possible way <e> <s> i am not sure that providing one of these facilities in every location where it could possibly be needed would be the best use of scarce funds <e> <s> the scanning facilities cost upwards of million to install and something like a year to run <e> <s> if there are just a few patients to be examined in this way there may be better uses for sums of that kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the last part of the noble baronesss supplementary question that where facilities cannot be made available in every location then patients should be facilitated to be moved to other locations for the purposes of these particular diagnostic procedures or in due course operations if that is proved necessary <e> <s> i also agree with the noble baroness that voluntary funds have played a very important part in financing some of these facilities and i think that is a most admirable thing <e>", "<cs> not without notice my lords <e> <s> perhaps i might find what figures i can and then write to the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm what has been said by the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos <e> <s> it is open to the consultant to refer the patient to whichever hospital he considers necessary for the examination or treatment of the patient concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the difficulties of proceeding along that course is that the list could be changing constantly because these facilities are being added to all the time as i said <e> <s> also some facilities are not the same as others that is to say some of the scanners have high resolution attachments which are not available in every case <e> <s> i am not certain therefore that such a list would be as helpful as the noble lord imagines but perhaps i might look into the matter and write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords the rawp formula as it is called the resource allocations working party formula provides for what are called cross-boundary <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very unwise to extrapolate the results of such very limited experiments as the one to which the noble lord refers because the results of wide-spread generic substitution as it is called would certainly result in an upward trend in the prices of drugs covered by patent for which no generic substitute exists <e> <s> therefore i hope the noble lord will not take too much guidance from the kind of information that he has given to your lordships <e> <s> having said that we are as the noble lord recognises considering this matter carefully and will announce our conclusions in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a perfectly respectable point of view but it is not necesssarily one which is universally shared <e> <s> it is worth saying that pharmacists are highly qualified in their own profession <e> <s> if some way forward along these lines were to be decided upon pharmacists would be well qualified to follow that course <e>", "<cs> my lords i have seen some of the programmes to which my noble friend refers and i have to say that these calculations rely upon a number of assumptions which are not necessarily proven in practice <e> <s> as for hospitals the position is that by agreement between doctors and medical staff in hospitals generic substitution is practised to a considerable extent <e> <s> but the circumstances are rather different <e> <s> for example doctors in hospitals are aware of precisely which generic substitute is to be dispensed in any particular case <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords we are at present reviewing the pharmaceutical prices regulation scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords this tends to vary from pharmacy to pharmacy <e> <s> it depends upon the price at which the pharmacist purchases his supplies <e> <s> generally speaking he is reimbursed at a standard rate and is free to buy his supplies provided they are from a reputable source at the best price he can get <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole purpose of this system is to establish a range of generic substitutes which are just as good as and indeed identical to the standard version <e> <s> but the difficulty is that the standard versions are generally covered by patent <e> <s> the generic substitutes cannot come into use until the patent expires <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of some anxiety on the point which the noble lord raises <e> <s> this is a matter for the pharmaceutical companies themselves <e> <s> it is also for the doctors to ensure that they are not misled by any excessive or misleading advertising <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that is true but i guess there is a difference between the sort of informative visits to which my noble friend refers and the excessive advertising and publicity junkets which have recently been the source of some publicity <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to my noble friend for his intervention speaking as he does with the great weight of experience in a major shipbuilding company <e> <s> but as i said at second reading industrial democracy goes hand in hand with good management <e> <s> i reminded your lordships that in our debate in the noble lord lord melchett who was then speaking for that government said <e>", "<cs> british shipbuilders as we provide for in the later clauses of the bill is to be moved in due course and as opportunity provides back into the environment of the commercial sector <e> <s> that is the environment that we want british shipbuilders to operate under and that indeed is quite different therefore from the proposals in this amendment <e>", "<cs> what the noble lord means by show the way as he puts it is to impose upon british shipbuilders constraints which are not imposed upon the competition within the private sector in this country and indeed not imposed in <e>", "<cs> the proposed power of veto of changes in the organisation contained in that part of the bill which amendment no <e> <s> seeks to delete is a far more modest and less interventionist power than that created by the then government in <e> <s> section of the act gave that government wide-ranging powers over the way in which the corporation was organised <e> <s> those have never been used and quite right too <e> <s> the management of the corporation is best placed to propose how the activities it controls should be organised <e> <s> it should not be subject to the incursive power of section of the act which is being repealed <e> <s> however the government have a natural interest in the efficient organisation of a public sector industry and if the amendment were accepted they would have no power to prevent the corporation from making changes in the organisation which in the governments view were likely to be detrimental to public policy <e>", "<cs> i am not in a position to give the noble lord details of each and every contract existing between the various warship builders and the ministry of defence or indeed the warship builders and any other customer that they may have <e> <s> i understand that some of the contracts referred to are indeed on the basis that the noble lord described but other contracts are of course on a fixed price tender basis <e>", "<cs> that is not quite fair <e> <s> i said also that we provide cash assistance to british shipbuilders in respect of specific orders when they are faced with direct competition from the far east or elsewhere <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the committee would wish me to be dragged into the details of a specific contract such as the one to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> in any event i do not have in front of me the details of that contract <e> <s> south korea is not a member of oecd but they do i believe although i stand open to correction subscribe to gatt and there are regulations of widely different kinds under the gatt rgime relating to dumping and assistance to shipbuilding <e> <s> if the noble lord has specific evidence of a specific case where regulations such as these to which south korea subscribes have been breached naturally i shall have the matter looked at <e>", "<cs> i am not sure what allegations the noble lord is trying to make <e> <s> he did not say at second reading that in some way south korea has broken the regulations to which both they and we subscribe <e> <s> is that what the noble lord is saying now <e>", "<cs> what i want the noble lord to do if he is able to do so is to tell me where south korea broke the regulations <e> <s> he is not able i believe to do that <e>", "<cs> if i may deal with the noble viscounts second point first these as he says are hallowed words they have appeared in at least one other piece of legislation and i am certain that if i looked i would find more <e> <s> the one that immediately comes to mind is the iron and steel act and subsequently i think they appeared in the consolidation of that act and some others <e> <s> whether those particular words have ever been tested in a court i rather doubt but perhaps i can inquire into that too and write to the noble viscount on that particular point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble baroness very rudely but i understand that they are being taken i think today or tomorrow in the other place <e>", "<cs> my lords i had to agree with all noble lords and the noble baroness who spoke when they said that these matters really are extraordinarily complicated <e> <s> the noble lord lord banks asked me when we could expect a consolidation measure to bring all the regulations under one heading <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that that would be highly desirable <e> <s> without taking advice i am not certain quite what timescale is envisaged or indeed whether we propose to take such action though i feel sure that it is somewhere in the pipeline <e> <s> perhaps i may make some inquiries and write to the noble lord about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft social security contributions amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful indeed flattered by the reception of the order that i have moved tonight <e> <s> i will certainly see whether i can give the assurance for which the noble lord has asked <e> <s> i am not quite certain of our plans with regard to that particular department and therefore for me to give a categoric assurance now might be unwise <e> <s> however i shall with pleasure look into the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a wide-ranging debate <e> <s> if i may say so on this amendment <e> <s> i make no complaint about that but i hope your lordships will forgive me if i confine my reply to the essence of the amendment as i see it <e> <s> these complex amendments because we are as the noble lord said at the outset considering three amendments would have far-reaching effects upon the ability of the secretary of state to exercise his powers of direction <e> <s> it is central to our purpose in introducing this bill that those powers would be used in the long-term interests of the industry <e> <s> this is the purpose of these powers <e> <s> it is for example our intention that the powers would be used to build upon the strengths of the industry and not for any purposes extraneous to the industrys needs <e> <s> in using these powers we would be concerned also to safeguard the interest of the taxpayer <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend needs the leave of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may intervene my noble friend cannot speak i believe even with the leave of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords securing genuine employee involvement is one of the main challenges facing management today <e> <s> we do not believe that can be done by putting companies into a tight legal straitjacket <e> <s> the government view is that employee involvement is best achieved by voluntary means and that management must assess for itself exactly what arrangements best suit its circumstances <e>", "<cs> with respect the noble lords intervention is out of order <e>", "<cs> however as your lordships will be aware the new employment act includes a provision requiring directors reports of larger companies to contain statements of the sort described in the amendment <e> <s> british shipbuilders subsidiaries are companies act companies and will be bound by the employment act <e> <s> statements on employee involvement should start to appear in the annual reports of bs subsidiaries from january <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has more or less correctly interpreted what i said <e> <s> to repeat it in short form i said that per cent <e> <s> of the work force of the bs organisation was already covered by existing legislation <e> <s> the remaining per cent <e> <s> already have the benefit of the practice of the main bs holding organisation and if that main organisation failed to publish adequate information we would certainly stand ready to use the powers which are already available to us <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my voice to those of every member of your lordships house who has spoken this evening by way of thanks to the noble lord lord obrien of lothbury for introducing this subject tonight and to begin by saying that her majestys government were very glad to note that your lordships sub-committee had decided to investigate the subject of community borrowing and lending thereby breaking some new ground <e> <s> the committees report before us is an interesting and valuable contribution <e> <s> i should like to pay tribute in particular to the sub-committees chairman the noble lord lord plowden whose place as we have heard has since been taken by the noble lord lord obrien who has moved the motion tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords yes my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> the maestro represents a very important step forward for british leyland particularly in the middle range <e>", "<cs> my lords the level of the capital disregard was raised from to as recently as november last year <e> <s> it is usual for increases in the supplementary benefit disregards to come into effect at the same time as the uprating of the benefit rates themselves and we are not persuaded that there are any special reasons for implementing this further substantial increase in the disregard at a date earlier than november <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that the noble lord is right when he says that the administrative arrangements could have been made more quickly than was in fact the case <e> <s> but the fact remains that administrative arrangements are not the only matters we have to see to <e> <s> there is also the matter of finding the money and the full year cost of this change is million <e>", "<cs> my lords the government announced recently that the first of the surrender value of life insurance policies would be disregarded and that is of course in addition to the sum as it presently is of capital disregard <e> <s> as for the home point that the noble baroness raised it is the case that the value of an owner-occupied house is disregarded but so too i think is the rent requirement for a tenant <e>", "<cs> my lords although it is true that supplementary benefit officers have some discretion in this matter i think it would be wrong to encourage them to anticipate the wishes of parliament in relation to the change of regulations which of course have not yet been expressed <e> <s> as for the other point raised by the noble lord perhaps i may write to him about that <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i said that there would be a saving of million <e> <s> i said that the total year cost of the change which we are now effecting is about million <e> <s> that is to say that million more of benefit will be paid because the capital cut-off disregard is higher <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that about to people will come into supplementary benefit who were not included before <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that the uprating is not precisely linked to the benefit rate uprating but nevertheless as i said it has been the practice to effect the uprating itself and the raising of the capital cut-off limit at the same time <e>", "<cs> my lords as i explained to the noble lord lord monson although it would no doubt be possible to speed up the administrative arrangements we would then have to find additional funds for this purpose <e> <s> i have to say that the calls on our funds are such that we cannot meet them all and we think it right to meet those in greatest need in the first instance <e>", "<cs> my lords may i join with every noble lord and noble baroness who has spoken tonight in expressing my thanks to the noble lord lord young of dartington for raising this matter <e> <s> we have had an interesting and if i may say so well-informed debate on this important subject <e> <s> before replying to the particular points that have been raised i must pay tribute to the activities of the building society movement over the past years <e> <s> its contribution to the spread of home ownership has been immense and it has over the years encouraged thrift as well <e> <s> indeed the building societies have had an incalculable effect upon the social evolution of this country and a not inconsiderable effect upon my own social evolution since i too have the benefit of the <e>", "<cs> my lords the kind of arrangements which the noble baroness describes would no doubt be of great assistance in this particular area <e> <s> however responsibility for this matter lies with the local education authorities guided and advised as they are by central government in the way that i have described <e> <s> i am not certain that the noble baroness is right when she refers to the increase in cases in hepatitis generally throughout the country <e> <s> although there has been a small increase in cases in the past two or three years the level is still well below what it was say in <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble baroness is right to ask me that question if i may say so because so far as i can ascertain leeds is indeed no worse than anywhere else in this particular case <e> <s> the fact is as the noble baroness says that this disease in common with most other infectious diseases may i say increases and decreases on a cyclical basis for reasons which are not yet fully understood <e>", "<cs> my lords the principal source of guidance is the source that i have already described namely the dissemination of information by the directors of education particularly in leeds as i said and also the various leaflets and other documents that i have referred to <e> <s> of course local medical officers of health are always willing to spend a good deal of time and indeed they do in lecturing for example to education authorities and in some cases in schools themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i would want to think about the answer to that question <e> <s> i am not necessarily convinced however that a large increase in the number of people considering these matters would necessarily produce the right answer <e> <s> as i have said the real way to control these diseases is by better health education <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but in there were cases <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the reasons why this disease hepatitis a is the disease we are talking about is more prevalent among children is because they in simple terms do not wash their hands so often <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the staff of the schools who ought to be persuading the children to wash their hands more regularly but as a parent of small children i know how difficult that is <e>", "<cs> my lords we do <e>", "<cs> my lords if i have your lordships permission to speak again i should like to make one additional point <e> <s> there is really very little between the noble lord lord bruce and i on the spirit of the amendment that he has put before your lordships house <e> <s> the problem is that the world shipbuilding industry of which the british shipbuilding industry is but a part is facing the worst recession in its fortunes for half a century or more <e> <s> that is why the situation is so difficult in the world shipbuilding industry and of course the british shipbuilding industry is not immune to those difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that i must intervene again and i hope that i still have your lordships permission to do so <e> <s> is the noble lord saying that there are ships on the british register now sailing which are unseaworthy <e>", "<cs> my lords i now rise to move that this bill do now pass <e> <s> the bill will give commercial freedom to british shipbuilders <e> <s> it will enable them to draw on the resources of the private sector and to open up new sources of finance <e> <s> but it will also give the government reserve powers to deal with unfair competition and to determine the borderline between public and private sectors of the industry <e> <s> these powers are as you lordships will recall subject to negative resolution of either house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am greatly obliged to your lordships <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i say that the government share with the noble lord the repugnance with which he views these operations when they are carried out for customary or cultural reasons <e> <s> this is not a part of our culture and we would not wish it to become so among any part of our population here whatever their ethnic origins <e> <s> we cannot of course legislate for other countries but through the world health organisation we have added our voice to encourage those who through exhortation and education are trying to eradicate these practices abroad <e>", "<cs> my lords may i start by thanking the noble lord lord bruce of donington for the kind remarks he addressed to me at the outset of his speech <e> <s> i shall endeavour to return them by saying that every time i rise to this dispatch box it seems to be in reply to a speech made by the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> i hope that that at least is for your lordships edification <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> apart from the fact that they are all connected with finance there is no obvious connection between the clauses in the bill if there were it would not be called miscellaneous <e> <s> but that is not to imply that the clauses have no value <e> <s> i commend them to the house as good sound administrative measures the sort of thing which a government have to bring before parliament from time to time <e> <s> for convenience we have grouped seven such measures in the present bill <e> <s> i shall explain what the clauses do and why the changes they bring about are desirable and i hope that these essentially administrative measures will commend themselves to your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to your lordships for your constructive response to the bill and in particular to my noble friend lord montagu of beaulieu for his quite full explanation of the functions and role of the development commission speaking as he does from a position of very considerable knowledge and experience of these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords the other services too are charged for broadly on the same basis <e> <s> the noble lord lord kilmarnock asked me in particular about the critical point <e> <s> he asked where is the critical point <e> <s> i think he was wondering what was the point at which the growth of the private sector might threaten the public sector <e> <s> i am not quite certain where that critical point is but i am quite certain that we are a very great way from that point at this moment when the private sector is some per cent <e> <s> or per cent <e> <s> of total health care in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord would allow me to ask him whether the machine he is talking about can detect the medical conditions that can exist <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be as well for me to say at the outset that i have no major announcement to make to your lordships house this evening <e> <s> i suppose i could sit down at that but perhaps i should go a little further <e> <s> i am sorry to say that the government are not yet ready to reach firm conclusions on this aspect of the report by the office of fair trading <e>", "<cs> my lords i am trying to demonstrate that the arguments in these matters are not all in the same direction and those who come before your lordships seeking to rely on one particular set of arguments need i think to have those arguments questioned <e> <s> i am quite prepared to agree that the other arguments that have been adduced are of equal validity though maybe they are per cent <e> <s> in the opposite direction <e>", "<cs> my lords the process of selecting a chairman and members is under way <e> <s> interested bodies including the federation of optical corporate bodies have been consulted on the terms of reference and these are being revised in the light of the comments received <e> <s> while the proposed terms of reference for the review include a review of the opticians act it is not the governments intention to delay consideration of the office of fair trading report on this account <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i believe that they do but on the other hand i do not believe that there is any room for complacency <e> <s> competitiveness is more than just price competitiveness <e> <s> it includes such things as liability for delivery and liability for the products themselves after they have been delivered <e> <s> those latter points are more difficult to measure quantitatively but there is considerable anecdotal evidence that they too are being improved <e>", "<cs> no my lords that is not correct at all <e> <s> the answer is given in the figures which i gave a moment ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i quite follow the gist of the noble lords supplementary question <e> <s> the important thing in this context is to get british industry moving effectively in world export markets despite the very considerable difficulties of the world recession which industry has faced <e> <s> i think that industry is achieving that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is in general quite right <e> <s> however we need to be careful not to support industries whose products are no longer required <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is right that capital investment is now beginning to show a modest increase <e> <s> like him i too hope that these investments will shortly be bearing fruit <e>", "<cs> my lords if a labour government had still been in power we would have been down the pan long ago <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is right <e> <s> if one looks back as far as he does the position then was perhaps even better than it is now <e>", "<cs> my lords the meaning of that expression did not appear to be lost on the noble lords friends <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i shall now repeat a statement being made by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for industry in another place about the alvey report <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to both noble lords who have spoken for their response to this statement <e> <s> i shall deal with as many of the points that have been put to me as i can <e> <s> the essential point on funding is that the government decided that per cent <e> <s> of funding of projects was not appropriate because as we say in the statement this rather reduces the commitment of the companies involved to ensure that they could at least argue that the research was conducted as effectively as it should be and that the company concerned retained the necessary commitment to the project <e> <s> we thought there was a risk that where projects were funded at the rate of only per cent <e> <s> by the companies concerned they would perhaps be conducting research projects just for the sake of <e>", "<cs> yes the noble lord lord avebury asked about the possibility of co-operation with japan <e> <s> this is certainly not ruled out in the future but it is not envisaged under the present proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords as for which companies are to participate in this programme and how they are to be selected a number of firms have been identified already for participation in this programme and discussions will proceed with others as the programme develops <e> <s> we certainly hope that the programme can be underway just as soon as possible it is to be hoped by the summer of this year in other words no delay at all <e> <s> as to the co-operation within europe the noble lord will be aware that the european community have a programme the esprit programme which is not too dissimilar from this one and in which some british companies have already been participating <e> <s> our european partners are already well seized of the opportunities that are offering themselves in this particular industry and are participating in a pretty enthusiastic way <e> <s> as i say we too are playing a small part in that particular programme <e>", "<cs> my lords it will be necessary for organisations and enterprises other than the government to respond to the programme that we are bringing forward <e> <s> on the specific point that the noble lord has put to me i should like to take some more advice if i may and write to him <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the statement that i have repeated this afternoon is the basis of a british national programme in this particular area <e> <s> the esprit programme is quite separate but that is not to say that some british firms are not participating in the esprit programme because they are <e>", "<cs> i too welcome the measure but perhaps for rather different reasons from those of the noble lord <e> <s> i am grateful to every noble lord and noble baroness who has contributed <e> <s> i cannot say that all of them agree with every single word that appears in the bill <e> <s> i fancy however that the main thrust of the proposals which as i stated in my opening remarks is to replace doubt with certainty and unreliability with stability has found an echo even with noble lords and noble baronesses opposite <e>", "<cs> i certainly hope so my lords <e> <s> however i should point out that the present licences for this technology are held by japanese companies and it is i believe thought that yet another type of video recorder as i say there are already three on the market might not necessarily be commercially attractive <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord would like to reconsider the terms of the assertion he has just made <e>", "<cs> i understand the concern of some of your lordships about consultation before the holder of any important post is appointed <e> <s> however i do not believe that formal consultation is appropriate <e> <s> it is not provided for in the appointment of the director general of fair trading nor in the appointment of the chairman of the board of the civil aviation authority <e> <s> this is not to say that the secretary of state makes such appointments without informal consultations <e> <s> but the need for consideration of a wide range of suitable appointees for flexibility in discussions and discretion in approaching persons who are already in employment all preclude formal consultations <e>", "<cs> without formal consultation <e>", "<cs> i hope that i may be permitted to intervene again <e> <s> i suggest to the noble lord that there may well be difficulties on the other side of the coin as well <e> <s> although the noble lord has cited an example where he says that formal consultation was provided for i have no doubt that the list of people who are required to be consulted under the legislation to which he refers is not exhaustive and there may well be people who are not required to be consulted in the appointment to which he refers <e> <s> in this context that could certainly create a good deal of difficulty if for example tema was written into the bill and had been consulted and one of the other trade associations to which i referred had not been consulted <e> <s> i think that there would be no justice in that <e> <s> in my view it is better to leave the bill as it is and i hope that your lordships will agree to do so <e>", "<cs> it might be appropriate if i reply to this amendment in the same way as the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran moved it that is to address myself to the general principles rather than to go through all the amendments one by one <e> <s> may i take <e>", "<cs> i accept that that is what was in the noble lords mind <e> <s> but other noble lords have raised different points and i was seeking to reply to the debate altogether so that i do not have to rise to my feet a dozen times between now and dinner <e> <s> let me say that i think it is sufficient that aggrieved persons should have access to the courts if they believe that the director has failed to fulfil any of the duties in clause so it is unnecessary to provide a special council <e>", "<cs> i am not quite clear how the noble lord sees the amendment working in practice <e> <s> who would decide which were the appropriate trade unions <e> <s> the assumption must be that it would be for the director to interpret that <e> <s> in any event however this question is decided i think that the amendment is undesirable <e> <s> of course i appreciate the noble lords concern about the need to consult trade unions about manning levels <e> <s> but as the noble lord lord mcintosh has already indicated he appreciates oftels staff will be civil servants and there already exist long-established procedures for consultation on all the matters to which he referred in his opening remarks <e> <s> terms and conditions of service including salaries are agreed centrally <e> <s> to add a further level of consultation would at best be unnecessary and i submit might also undermine existing procedures <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has i fear become the victim of a misapprehension <e> <s> we are talking about the staff of oftel not that of british telecom <e>", "<cs> nonsense <e>", "<cs> if i may intervene at this point i can answer the noble viscount in the affirmative on that particular matter <e> <s> as i understand it the treasury are responsible for approving the terms and conditions of all civil servants <e> <s> the employment and the terms and conditions of all civil servants are subject to treasury approval and this form of words has been put into the bill so that the terms that would be approved would be identical to those agreed for all other civil servants in parallel grades <e>", "<cs> just a moment please <e> <s> there is no provision for the formal consultation machinery with so-called appropriate trade unions in respect of the appointments to any of the public bodies of which i am aware <e> <s> i stand open to correction if the noble lord lord molloy can think of a parallel body but so far as i know there is none <e>", "<cs> i am not going to rise to that sort of proposal <e> <s> what i am saying is that there is no formal consultative machinery as is proposed in this amendment in any of the other public bodies of which i am aware <e> <s> if the noble lord can think of one then of course i shall give way and hear what he has to say and if i am wrong i shall immediately withdraw <e>", "<cs> no the noble lord is not quite correct <e> <s> we are considering here the appointments to a regulatory body <e> <s> that is a very different matter from the appointments to a public corporation or less still a private corporation <e> <s> i stand by what i said appointments to public bodies especially regulatory bodies such as this are not the subject of formal consultative procedures with the trade unions involved or as i think the noble lord lord bruce appeared to imply almost any trade union that might have some distant interest in the matter <e> <s> that is not to say that there will not be informal consultations as we have already discussed in other contexts and at great length <e> <s> however if i may say so i do hope that the noble lord will not continue to mar the tone of this debate with a number of personal references as he did earlier on <e>", "<cs> it is of course ministers in the treasury who formally take the decisions to which i have referred <e> <s> as the noble lord will be aware when a matter such as this comes before the treasury it is a minister in the treasury who takes the decision on the advice no doubt of his officials <e> <s> however it is the minister who takes the decision <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but i must correct the noble lord again <e> <s> the procedure in this matter and i speak from some experience in these matters is that when treasury approval for something such as this is sought that approval is not regarded as valid unless it is issued by the minister concerned <e>", "<cs> i am disinclined to try to extend this debate much longer <e> <s> that is for others if they seek to do so not for me <e> <s> we are basing this new body on the form that was agreed and i believe widely welcomed even on benches opposite when we set up the director general of fair trading and his office a few years ago <e> <s> that was a proposal which was welcomed on all sides of your lordships house and in another place <e> <s> the procedures that we are now adopting are procedures modelled closely on the procedures agreed at that time <e>", "<cs> i said regulatory bodies <e> <s> i was careful to use those particular words <e> <s> i do not think that any of the organisations which the noble lord refers to would fall into that category <e> <s> we have had a longish debate on this matter <e> <s> it is not for me to say when such a debate should be drawn to a close and there is at least one noble lord who certainly ought to intervene before we reach a conclusion on this matter but i put it to your lordships that what is proposed is <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble and learned lord that if the only argument i had to deploy tonight was that this was some long-established arrangement and therefore there was no good reason to upset it that would not be a particularly good argument <e> <s> but that is not the case <e> <s> what we are comparing these proposals with is a recently established arrangement in so far as the director general of fair trading is concerned an arrangement which was widely welcomed both by your lordships and in another place <e> <s> it is the amendment which now seeks i would say prematurely to reject that as unsatisfactory when it has worked so well and to propose these new alternative arrangements <e>", "<cs> we have it in mind that the staff would number about in this particular office <e> <s> i think that is the answer to the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> this amendment clearly seeks to limit the size of oftel through direct parliamentary control of its budget <e> <s> may i first repeat the assurance that i gave to your lordships at second reading <e> <s> i made it clear then that the regulation would be operated with a light rein and that there would be a minimum of interference with the legitimate commercial decisions so that companies can flourish in response to this matter as long as they compete fairly with each other <e> <s> secondly the budget of the director and his office will already be voted by parliament <e> <s> the normal parliamentary scrutiny the procedure is i am sure well familiar to the noble lord lord bruce is surely appropriate <e> <s> no more is done before money is voted to the office of fair trading and i see no special reason for extra parliamentary control in the case of oftel <e>", "<cs> whatever the intention of the amendment may be the fact is that the functions which i described in my earlier remarks will have to be paid for out of the sums of money we are here discussing and which are provided for in this clause <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross of marnock is right to sound a cautionary note about how far it is proper for members of your lordships house to consider these matters <e> <s> the other place would take grave exception to any proposal that your lordships house should have specific control over the sum of money which is to be made available or otherwise for these purposes <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to have to tell the committee that i have not been persuaded by the arguments which have been deployed in support of this amendment <e> <s> if i were to give some assurance that we will look at the matter i fear that i should be misleading your lordships <e> <s> i am convinced that the proposals contained in this bill are the right course to follow <e>", "<cs> my understanding is that the advisory staff will be additional to the number i gave to your lordships earlier <e> <s> if i am wrong about that i will write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> if i may say so the speech of the noble lord lord bruce of donington admirable though it was had a familiar ring about it <e> <s> rather than reply at length may i refer your lordships to what i said on the second reading of the bill since the noble lord repeated much of what he had said on second reading <e> <s> my reply is in col of <e>", "<cs> i am happy to be able to reassure the noble lord lord ross of marnock that the director general will not have to meet on the embankment and that offices will be provided <e>", "<cs> it is the provision made in clause <e>", "<cs> i could explain at some length how the matter works <e> <s> perhaps your lordships will forgive me if i do not do so but i will happily write to my noble friend with an explanation <e>", "<cs> with pleasure <e>", "<cs> i was about to say exactly the same as my noble friend <e> <s> the amendments indeed seek to fix the salary and pension entitlements of the director who will be a civil servant by an affirmative resolution of both houses <e> <s> why pick on the poor director <e> <s> there are over other civil servants whose salaries wages or pensions could be fixed in the same way <e> <s> however i take it that the intention is to reduce the directors salary and so reduce the attraction of the post to able and well-qualified candidates <e>", "<cs> i can answer that question swiftly <e> <s> it is taken straight from the statute which as i have said on so many occasions this evening set up the director-general of fair trading in his office <e> <s> the provisions are identical <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said the document has only just been received and it has not yet been possible for me to reach a considered conclusion on it <e>", "<cs> my lords one permanent regional secure unit providing beds of which are currently in use opened in november at st lukes hospital middlesbrough <e> <s> in addition facilities at the towers hospital leicester langdon hospital devon rainhill hospital mersey and prestwich hospital manchester offering among them beds should begin to admit patients shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble lords first supplementary question is yes we are still committed in principle to achieving places in regional secure units and i hope that by the end of about places will be available in such units <e> <s> as the noble lord is aware these units are designed as a medium-secure facility between the special hospitals on the one hand and the psychiatric hospitals in the national health service on the other <e> <s> certainly when they are fully in use they will provide some measure of relief to both <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is right when she says that the reason why some beds are not in use at st lukes is that there is not yet a sufficient number of staff available <e> <s> this is a new venture within the national health service and therefore it is not surprising that we have not yet been able to obtain all the staff which we want for the programme but recruitment is proceeding and so is some training <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that staffing problems were the principal difficulty with regard to the unit to which my noble friend refers <e> <s> i have it in mind to visit that particular facility shortly to see the problems for myself <e>", "<cs> no my lords the noble lord is not quite right in that <e> <s> the money which was allocated to the national health service specifically for this purpose has by and large though not exclusively been spent on interim secure units rather than on the permament facilities which the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale was asking about <e> <s> as for the position within prisons a great many of the mentally disordered prisoners to whom the noble lord refers are probably not sufficiently ill for detention under the mental health acts to be justified and therefore they have to be detained in prisons <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know the precise answer to that question because it would depend on which of the patients could be certified under the mental health legislation <e> <s> naturally i do not have that figure in front of me but i could try to find out and write to the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> it might be helpful if i make some brief general remarks before dealing with the specific points that have been put to me <e> <s> clause and schedule together including subsection to which the amendment refers replace the development commissioners and the development fund established under the development and road improvement acts of and with the development commission a statutory grant-aided corporation <e> <s> transitional provisions ensure that the present commissioners and staff continue in office without loss of status or rights and that all the liabilities and assets of the development fund are transferred to the development commission to be established under this bill <e>", "<cs> i have to say that i am not quite certain about the answer to that question <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord will allow me to inquire into it and write to him <e> <s> my understanding is that that is not the case that they will not be able to do that <e> <s> i will clarify the position and write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i am aware that the inquiry is proceeding <e> <s> i am afraid that there are not yet any conclusions to be reported to your lordships <e> <s> perhaps i could make further inquiries and at the risk of sounding somewhat unbriefed will again undertake to write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i can assure the noble lord that there will be no blind enforcement of any arbitrary level of staffing of the commission under the new arrangements <e> <s> of course it is not possible for the government to give some <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> the burden of these amendments is that benefits could and should be uprated twice a year rather than once <e> <s> in this context three factors have fundamental importance necessity cost and operational feasibility <e> <s> the main case to be made for more frequent upratings on grounds of necessity arises in times of high and rapidly rising inflation <e> <s> for example the argument for six-monthly upratings was particularly relevant in and when the <e>", "<cs> the purpose of this amendment is plain even if it is far from clear i fear that as drafted it would achieve the desired result <e> <s> it provides a variation on a theme which has already been the subject of extensive debate both here and in the other place <e> <s> up to now the suggestion has been that there should be some form of adjustment to benefits in if this years up-rating increase is less than the percentage rise in prices from november to november <e> <s> the noble lord lord banks goes one stage further than that by proposing to delay any adjustment of this kind until we have had at least two up-ratings on the new basis <e>", "<cs> in the context both of this amendment and of the earlier one i have already explained why more frequent up-ratings are not appropriate <e> <s> what the noble baroness is really asking for i think is a weekly up-rating arrangement or some such arrangement as that whereby pensioners are always paid benefit precisely in line with the level of inflation <e> <s> that i am afraid is not a practicable proposition and i cannot hold out any hope of the government thinking otherwise <e>", "<cs> i understood the noble baroness was referring to unemployment benefit recipients <e> <s> i remember that she referred earlier to pensioners who <e>", "<cs> i hope that your lordships will forgive me if i do not again deploy all the arguments <e>", "<cs> the difficulty is that i do not believe there are experts of this kind on the unemployment register <e>", "<cs> my lords although the point raised by the noble lord does not precisely fall within the ambits of the bill he is quite entitled to raise it as he did yesterday <e> <s> i undertook to write to him <e> <s> i repeat that undertaking now and will be happy to provide a copy of the letter to the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e>", "<cs> if i may i should like to say a few words at this point about the governments position <e> <s> as the noble lord lord kennet has said the way he has constructed his bill is to prohibit all operations on these parts of the female anatomy and then to provide certain savings in terms of medical necessity <e> <s> the government have a good deal of sympathy for the line proposed by the noble lord lord hunter of newington because if for no other reason it means that the somewhat draconian policing arrangements which are called into play by clauses and of this bill will not then be necessary <e>", "<cs> i fear i cannot go that far but i can say that i think it is important that the penalties provided for in this bill are the sort of penalties that one would receive for comparable offences under other legislation and also that the penalties provided in the bill are appropriate for the courts in which the offences will come to be tried should that happen <e>", "<cs> this clause and the one which follows it are the two clauses in the bill which give the government the greatest difficulty <e> <s> i accept that the proposals contained in these amendments quite significantly improve the position so far as the government are concerned but we remain doubtful in particular about the requirement that the views of two psychiatrists shall be taken into account if the operation is to be done for reasons of mental health <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is aware of the anxieties that we have about the particular matter which is addressed by this amendment because we have discussed them privately together on an earlier occasion <e> <s> i have to say that i am not entirely convinced by the arguments which the noble lord adduced about the situation of midwives which we would certainly wish to consider rather carefully <e> <s> the noble lord will remember the thoughts that i have put to him privately on that matter and i hope that he will allow me the opportunity of considering the words that he used in the committee this afternoon in support of the assertion that he now puts to your lordships <e> <s> i was hoping to avoid undue discussion of the subsequent amendment by simply in a very short way expressing the governments view on that but i am happy to await another opportunity <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could say to the noble baronesses lady jeger and lady gaitskell that one of the difficulties is that the term female circumcision has come to describe a whole range of operations from a quite severe total removal of the clitoris as it is called to something very much less than that <e> <s> it is the difficulties with operations at the smaller end of the scale that we are here considering <e>", "<cs> with respect the present legal position provides that these operations may take place and i think that the onus for proving that some new constraint is necessary rests upon the noble lord lord kennet <e>", "<cs> i am bound to admit that i find this amendment something of an improvement <e> <s> as i have said in relation to earlier amendments i do not think that it goes far enough but as far as it goes i agree with it <e>", "<cs> i was speaking in general terms about the other improvements i should have liked to have seen in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords for some time now the figures have indicated that the growth and the rate of growth and the rate of birth to use a better expression of small companies has significantly exceeded the number of closures <e> <s> in our efforts to create the right climate for industrial growth the government have sought to remove obstacles to industrial development and the efficient use of resources <e> <s> we have been pursuing policies to improve the supply performance of the economy by providing greater incentives for work and enterprise and by improving the operation of markets <e> <s> the government have removed a whole host of damaging controls which had been holding industry back <e> <s> we have now abolished hire purchase controls as well as pay price dividend and exchange controls <e> <s> on the subject of exchange controls one or two noble lords suggested that we ought to control the outflow of capital from this country <e> <s> but of course to do that would strangle at the same time the important inflow of capital which we are seeing at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i wholly accept that point and entirely agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be misleading your lordships if i were to suggest that the oil were anything other than of the greatest benefit to our present economy <e> <s> however the oil industry does not form part of the manufacturing industry which is the essence of our debate this evening <e>", "<cs> that is exactly so my lords <e> <s> i said that it would apply to the people that the noble baroness is hoping and expecting it will apply to <e>", "<cs> my lords i greatly appreciate the kind words addressed to myself <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the commons amendments be now considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their

agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> to <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will recall from earlier stages there is most certainly a form of operation on these parts of the female anatomy which could indeed be rendered necessary by psychological considerations and quite properly so as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i was seeking to encompass the sort of problem which i think the noble lord lord kennet has sought to encompass in the amendment that he has to follow this one on the order paper that is to say the rectification of abnormality <e> <s> i think it was the noble lord lord kennet who at an earlier stage described the circumstances where this might be necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords just before we now read the bill a third time i think that i would not wish to leave you lordships under any misapprehension that the bill passing as i presume it will in a moment is actually passed in accordance with government approval <e> <s> we have not expressed a formal view on the merits or otherwise of the bill <e> <s> of course we agree with the principle which the noble lord has adduced but we have considerable reservations about some of the provisions of the bill and i should not wish your lordships to be of any other view <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is in order to respond to that point there are two matters that i should mention <e> <s> first the bill that we are now considering is not going to become law <e> <s> the governments view on some future bill that might be introduced in some future parliament will have to be expressed when that bill is introduced <e> <s> i am not of course certain that anyone proposes to reintroduce the bill or even whether the noble lord lord kennet proposes to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords we are faced at this moment by a great imbalance in these weapons in europe <e> <s> there is no way that that imbalance can be allowed to continue <e> <s> the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> yes unless it is the zero option that is accepted by the soviet union a genuine real and worthwhile <e>", "<cs> my lords i am advised that there would be no technical difficulty in changing to british manufactured material of comparable quality but the decisions in this matter must be taken by the companies themselves <e> <s> the noble lord may be interested to know that for some years we have been financing a demonstrator programme at british aerospace warton <e> <s> for that work it was agreed at the outset that on technical grounds carbon fibre of united kingdom origin would be used <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid these were matters for the commercial judgment of british aerospace and not for the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord is referring to the aircraft manufacturers and certainly i can confirm that the availability of this new material opens the way for some exciting developments <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly hope that it may be possible to use a british source for this material in the future but i must say that in this initial experimental programme it would not have been right to impose conditions of that kind on the manufacturer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that british aerospace will take careful note of the exchanges in your lordships house this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said it would not be right for the government to impose conditions on the manufacturer of the kind the noble lord has in mind <e> <s> we are always anxious that british sources of materials or components are used when the technical specification is right when the price is right and when the other conditions such as delivery are right <e>", "<cs> my lords i imagine there are other applications for this material but as is so often the case it is the aerospace industry that is leading the way <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as spanish entry into the european community is concerned in relation to the restrictions to which the noble lord has referred it is of course the case that spain agreed to lift these restrictions by virtue of the lisbon agreement which was agreed to in and she confirmed that in <e> <s> as many have said before at this dispatch box including me it would be inconceivable that spain could enter the european community while these restrictions remained in force <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a number of questions included in that supplementary which i shall seek to answer <e> <s> the package that we are suggesting to the gibraltar government in respect of this matter is a very comprehensive and generous one <e> <s> we are proposing to transfer the yard and its assets free of charge to the gibraltar government <e> <s> we are proposing to provide million-worth of aid to meet an initial refit of the yard and certain initial operating costs <e> <s> we are proposing in addition to provide a substantial package of royal naval work to the new dockyard under its commercial managers <e> <s> in addition to that we announced last year an aid package amounting to some million to the gibraltar government and that is now being specifically committed to projects over a period of years <e> <s> finally there are the generous redundancy payments which will be made available to the dockyard workers <e> <s> what is proposed in that regard is that there are about workers in the dockyard at present of whom will initially be made redundant will be transferred to the royal navy base which will of course continue i think that about will be taken on by the new commercial operators of the yard initially and another considerable number of dockyard workers will be taken on as the commercial work in the yard develops and proceeds <e>", "<cs> my lords on the nato point it is the fact that the nato states make provision for their own refit and repair of their vessels and the yard therefore had no specific nato role <e> <s> i suggest that it is important to distinguish between the dockyard and the naval base <e> <s> the naval base in gibraltar does of course have a continuing naval role <e> <s> as for the redundancy point to which the noble lord referred it is the case that will initially be made redundant but or so will be taken on almost at once by the commercialisation of the yard <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that there is a commercial operator willing to take on the yard <e> <s> as the noble lord may be aware the firm of appledore whose name may be familiar to the noble lord have indicted that they are willing to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords it certainly has nothing to do with the views of the spanish government <e> <s> i suggest that the provision of dockyard facilities is separate from the provision of defence facilities <e> <s> the defence facilities at gibraltar namely the provision of the naval base the aerodrome the infantry battalion and the arming of the local gibraltar regiment on the rock are really separate from the provision of dockyard facilities <e> <s> as naval technology has developed the requirement for dockyard facilities has changed very substantially <e> <s> as your lordships know the chatham dockyard is to be closed shortly indeed it is already virtually closed and for that reason it was not thought proper that the additional facility at gibraltar should be kept open <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend will forgive me if i do not develop the position of the discussions presently in train between her majestys government and the gibraltar government because my honourable friend is in fact in gibraltar today and i would not wish to say anything that made his task more difficult <e> <s> as for the position of appledore that company will of course be dealing with the gibraltar government and not the british government <e> <s> but our contribution to the success of the yard among all the measures within the package to which i have referred is of course the royal naval work which is very substantial and of course the considerable sum of money <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not pulling out of gibraltar we maintain a very significant defence posture in gibraltar which of course relates to the threat to nato <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble lord is mistaken <e> <s> although there will be no naval dockyard as such in gibraltar the naval base there will continue including all the forces to which i have referred <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would allow me to finish my opening remarks i shall most certainly be willing to deal with that point when i close the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his reception to this order and perhaps i might seek to reply to the point made by the noble lord lord mayhew when he intervened during my opening remarks <e> <s> there has been no discernible longterm effect on recruiting from the falklands conflict <e> <s> there was some immediate short-term effect i understand but nothing having any long-term implications <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is right more or less in the numbers to which she referred <e> <s> however perhaps it is worthwhile getting this matter into perspective <e> <s> the percentage shortfall is only and respectively <e> <s> we are for the moment having no difficulty in making up this shortfall by using civilian doctors and others <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> it is always open to such doctors to volunteer for service in the armed forces <e>", "<cs> my lords as i was saying we are really having no difficulty in meeting our recruitment targets in this area and any doctor who is presently unemployed and wants to serve in the armed forces is of course able to volunteer <e> <s> but i would not want to encourage a large increase in the number of applicants for places in the armed services which we could not meet <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am ashamed to say that i do not have that answer in front of me but i will find out and i will write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i fancy that a wider range of cures is now available <e>", "<cs> my lords there are already some links between military hospitals and the local populations and between military units and national health service hospitals <e> <s> however the essential difference between civilian and service doctors is that service doctors must be ready to serve abroad sometimes at very short notice <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble viscount lord buckmaster for reminding your lordships of the appalling violations of basic human rights which are widespread in so many parts of the world <e> <s> the noble viscounts question referred to asia africa and latin america <e> <s> and some of the tragic abuses of human rights are indeed to be found in these continents <e> <s> but it remains a sad truth that grave abuses are to be found in europe also <e> <s> they can occur whenever those in authority harbour the delusion that they somehow have a right in the name of some dogma or straightforward self-interest to override the basic freedoms which we cherish so highly <e> <s> they can occur when authorities fail to control the excesses of their officials <e> <s> the government deplore all such abuses regardless of the reasons with which their perpetrators attempt to justify them <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that the role of the non-aligned nations and lately spain in the preparation of the final document has been most useful <e> <s> as for the two points that the noble lord put to me about the cde conference it is true that the mandate for that conference is included in the final document and the government certainly adhere to that <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly true that the outcome of the madrid conference so far as the human rights provisions are concerned is less than we should have wished <e> <s> having said that i would add that it is true that what we are now facing in the madrid conference is a consensus bar one on the final document <e> <s> and i must say that the soviet union too has made some concessions <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that it will not be possible to go further today because as the noble lord points out we are short of a consensus by one which is of course malta <e>", "<cs> my lords the document to which i have referred and which is now almost agreed in madrid provides as i say for some important new steps with regard to human rights <e> <s> in particular there is to be a meeting of experts in connection with this matter in canada in and this is embodied in the document <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the second point that the noble lord made the onus is now clearly upon malta to join the consensus that has been reached <e> <s> it is the governments view that the proposals that malta is now bringing forward would not be appropriately included in the final document <e> <s> indeed that is the view i understand of the other members of the conference in madrid all indeed save malta itself <e> <s> as for the implications of the cde for other conferences that are taking place in the world for example the start the inf and the disarmament conference in geneva we shall have to see whether there is any read-across to use the jargon from one to the other but the preliminary conference with regard to the cde will take place towards the end of this year <e>", "<cs> my lords the csce rules provide that agreement must be by consensus which is to say that no one must disagree <e> <s> malta is so far failing to agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope and believe that we can avoid a conflict with that country not only within the next three months but indeed for as far ahead as i can see <e> <s> with regard to the madrid conference and the csce process generally we never thought that we would achieve everything overnight <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that if malta wanted to hold such a conference and convene it it would be open to malta to do so <e> <s> the question is whether the provision of such a conference and some of the other things that malta wants to go with it should be included in the document that we are now considering <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with both assertions <e>", "<cs> my lords in accordance with united nations security council resolution the secretary-general is holding consultations about the implementation of the united nations plan for namibia <e> <s> we and our partners in the five have assured the secretary-general of our support and cooperation <e> <s> separate discussions on regional security issues are continuing between the united states and angola <e> <s> progress towards namibian independence depends on these <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have endeavoured to explain responsibility for this matter rests with the united nations <e> <s> as the noble lord knows we are a member of the five and the five are in close touch and considering ways in which to move the negotiations forward for example the foreign ministers of the five met in williamsburg on th may and again in paris on th june and affirmed their intention to achieve a settlement <e> <s> my right honourable friend the foreign secretary discussed namibia with members of the united states administration earlier in july during his visit to washington <e>", "<cs> my lords the policy of the british government in this matter within the ambit of the united nations plan is of course to allow namibians to choose for themselves the type of government they require <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said before the onus of producing an initiative rests with the five of which we are a member and with the secretary-general of the united nations <e> <s> he is moving this matter forward in the ways that i have described <e> <s> as regards the south african troops in angola we certainly think that they ought to withdraw we certainly think that all foreign troops in the region ought to withdraw <e>", "<cs> my lords the united nations plan in essence calls for the withdrawal of all the foreign troops from namibia the return of the swapo troops to their bases the holding of free and fair elections in that country and in the interim the presence of a united nations force to see that the elections are properly conducted <e> <s> we are using our best endeavours to see that that plan is operated <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that the attitude of the south african government on some of these matters has been less than helpful <e> <s> but they do have some legitimate security concerns in that part of the world not least the presence of cuban troops in angola <e> <s> we hope that the right way forward therefore is the way that i have described <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that a settlement is highly desirable in this matter but i am afraid that it is not possible for the british government or even for the five to impose a settlement upon the region <e> <s> i believe that the interests of all parties would be served by an early settlement but as i say that is not a matter over which we can wave a magic wand <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the case that cuban troops are principally in angola but the south africans can hardly be expected to face that with equanimity <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i should like to repeat a statement being made in another place by my honourable friend the under-secretary of state for defence procurement <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords and i shall endeavour to answer as many as possible of the points which they have put to me <e> <s> the noble lord lord bishopston first asked me about consultation with the trade unions <e> <s> as the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i can certainly confirm what the noble lord asked me in the last part of his remarks <e> <s> as i said earlier the lisbon agreement is already in force and it paves the way to settle all outstanding differences <e> <s> that is perhaps the fundamental difference between this situation and the situation which prevailed last year elsewhere in the world in particular in the south atlantic <e> <s> we have an agreement with the spanish government over ending the restrictions on the border at the frontier with gibraltar and that agreement also provides for subsequent discussions on anything which the spaniards seek to raise <e> <s> so i do not think that the situation is in any way parallel <e> <s> in any event as i say the nato posture in gibraltar remains unaffected <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i apologise for not answering that question <e> <s> sir joshua appears to be very happy with the arrangements that have been reached <e> <s> no doubt he would have preferred the royal naval dockyard to have remained forever exactly as it is but i am afraid that that was not one of the possibilities open to us <e> <s> it was clearly very much part of the excess capacity that we had apprehended in the royal naval dockyard system generally and i think that sir joshua is well pleased with the agreement that he has reached with the british government <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the last point is a matter for the gibraltar government and not for me <e> <s> in the first part of his supplementary question the noble lord asked about the terms on which the money would be made available <e> <s> as i said in the statement subject to the implementation of the improved working practice referred to the money will be made available on grant terms <e> <s> there is no question of a loan being involved in this case <e> <s> the work that we are providing will in the early months and years of the new commercial dockyard be substantially all that it can cope with <e> <s> i hope therefore that by the end of that time it will be in a position to take on a good deal of other outside commercial work <e>", "<cs> my lords cost us dear it will in terms of million <e>", "<cs> over the next three years or so <e> <s> that is a substantial amount of money <e> <s> the gibraltar community is of course important but a fairly small community nonetheless by our standards in terms of the number of people living in gibraltar <e> <s> i believe that we have provided them with a very effective and appropriate package for the problems that they have put to us <e> <s> as i have stated sir joshua hassan is entirely happy apparently with the arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords it will of course be necessary for the new commercial shipyard in gibraltar to operate on an efficient and competitive basis <e> <s> i have no doubt that under the new arrangements it will do so <e> <s> the facilities at algeciras to which my noble friend refers are i understand fairly modest but i do not think that the gibraltar shipyard will be afraid of genuine competition <e>", "<cs> my lords the population of gibraltar is something in the region of <e> <s> if the noble lords agile brain can divide million by he will arrive at the figure which he requested in the first part of his supplementary question <e> <s> as to consultation with the spanish government on the matter i do not think that this would have been appropriate in this case and it did not take place <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i can answer that supplementary in one word generously <e> <s> i can also say that the sum of million does indeed come from the overseas aid budget <e>", "<cs> my lords our aid budget as a whole is finite <e> <s> in the light of that consideration we ask the recipient countries to declare the priorities as they see them in the aid programme that we can make available to them <e> <s> it is for them to decide to which particular areas they attach the greatest importance and in the case that the noble lord has indicated not all the countries have shown that preference <e>", "<cs> my lords we and the chinese are agreed that the common aim must be to maintain hong kongs stability and prosperity and both parties are therefore proceeding with that in mind <e> <s> i think it would be unhelpful if i were to make additional comments because we think that the negotiations are best conducted in confidence <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that those who are representing the united kingdom in these discussions are taking very fully into account the views of the people of hong kong <e>", "<cs> my lords the tabling of questions in your lordships house is not a matter for me <e>", "<cs> my lords the principal aim as i said just now is for the negotiations to have regard to the prosperity and stability of hong kong <e> <s> it would be unhelpful i think if either party went into these negotiations with any preconceived notions <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend that the chinese are well aware of all our views in these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said just now to the noble lord we fully take into account the views of the hong kong people in these matters <e> <s> there is a certain parliamentary system in hong kong but of course i recognise it is not of the same kind as ours <e>", "<cs> my lords we understand that the soviet state border for their airspace is the line established by the soviet law on the border of the ussr of th november <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we would prefer to comment on these proposals when we see them rather than some way in advance <e> <s> but i can assure the noble lord that we shall have his concerns very much in mind when we do receive them <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly accept the general importance of this matter although it is perhaps worth saying that the number of flights that operate in the region which is of concern to the noble lord is very few indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords the board of crown agents have submitted proposals for substantial reorganisation following their loss of the investment management of the government of bruneis funds <e> <s> these proposals are under urgent consideration and i hope that a decision will be reached shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords i can certainly confirm that these are just the sort of factors that the government will wish to take into account in reaching a decision on this matter <e> <s> but of course some of the arguments apply the other way as well <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right in saying that the crown agents administer payment of a large number of overseas pensions of various kinds on behalf both of the oda and indeed of certain overseas authorities <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend that satisfactory arrangements will be made for handling these pensions if the crown agents cease to exist <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord is right to say that we have not yet debated that report <e> <s> no doubt an arrangement can be made through the usual channels if that is thought appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in answer to an earlier question that is just the sort of consideration that the government will wish to take into account in reaching a decision on this matter <e> <s> no final decision has yet been taken and i am certain that the house will want to take an opportunity to hear it when it is made <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i do not believe i gave any assurance of that kind <e> <s> in any event it would not be a matter for me <e> <s> i was referring in answer to the noble and learned lord to his question as to whether we had had a discussion on an earlier report <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend that although your lordships have not yet seen fit to discuss it the government have been considering it <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i should now like to intervene to repeat a statement that is being made by my right honourable friend the foreign and commonwealth secretary in the other place <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their response to the statement <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce of donington thought that he apprehended some change in our approach to the revision of the budgetary arrangements generally <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that that is not so <e> <s> we have consistently argued as the noble lord knows for thoroughgoing reform of the common agricultural policy which we are certain will bring in its train at least a containment and perhaps a reduction of the amount of money spent in that particular area <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that you will forgive me if i intervene again to repeat a statement made by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for defence in the other place about cruise missile deliveries <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their response <e> <s> the noble lord lord bishopston asked me first of all about consultation <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that the british government have been in the closest consultation with the united states over all the matters referred to in the statement and the type of insinuation that was contained in the noble lords supplementary question was quite without foundation <e> <s> as for the question of training deployments these have yet to be decided upon in detail <e> <s> i am afraid that i cannot give the noble lord the <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly recognise that there is more than one view about the point that the noble lord is making to me <e> <s> the government have made their position very clear on this matter and i have no doubt that the noble lord will make his position equally clear when we come to discuss this matter tomorrow evening <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> of course it is the policy of this government to pursue multilateral balanced and verifiable disarmament proposals and that is what is happening in the various fora <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said we are having talks with the soviet union in the various disarmament fora that are presently in being <e> <s> there are the inf talks the start talks and the mbfr talks in vienna concerned with conventional weapons there are the general disarmament talks taking place in geneva which at the present time are particularly concerned with chemical weapons <e> <s> the united kingdom is playing an important role in the forthcoming conference on disarmament in europe <e> <s> therefore talks are going on <e> <s> we are now looking for a positive response from the ussr <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not seen the report to which the noble lord refers and i know of no such plan <e>", "<cs> my lords the west will certainly be willing to consider any proposals put forward by the soviets at the inf talks at geneva which could lead to a settlement on this matter <e> <s> however the difficulty which faces us at the present time is that the soviets have an overwhelming superiority in this type of weapon <e> <s> indeed as i mentioned earlier they have rockets which as my noble friend lord orr-ewing reminded us each have three warheads while at the same time we have absolutely none of these land-based intermediate range weapons <e> <s> so any proposal which the soviets may make by way of a reduction in the numbers which they are prepared to contemplate will have to be considered by us in that context <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much hope that the soviets will not withdraw from the present talks in the light of todays events or of any other news <e> <s> after all the united states has remained at the table in geneva despite the continued deployment of sss by the soviet union throughout that time <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that if you are sitting underneath it the difference is not very great if any <e> <s> but the distinction is the question of deployment <e> <s> these ss missiles are a wholly new element in the nuclear equation and that is why we had to make the response that we did <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for asking that question <e> <s> if i said revised i was mistaken the correct words are of course halted modified or reversed <e>", "<cs> my lords it is indeed the case that we are not represented at the inf talks but then of course we were not the progenitor of these weapons so it would not he appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords for the reasons that i have already explained <e> <s> there was no need to establish a precedent because the alternative arrangements were equally as good <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no advantage whatever as i say in such a course of action <e> <s> there is no military advantage and above all it would do nothing to enhance the crucial role of these weapons as a deterrent against aggression or the threat of aggression <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that that is necessary because as i say we are entirely satisfied that the tests of which we have been fully apprised have been carried out satisfactorily <e>", "<cs> my lords first this is a question and not a motion <e> <s> i said at the beginning of my remarks that i thought that one thing that came clearly from that poll was that the british people are perfectly clear that no decision on the use of nuclear weapons based in this country should be taken without the consent of the british government and that is our position <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that if we had a system of proportional representation in this country the result in the other place at the present time might be different from what it is but i fancy that the conservative party would nonetheless have won the last election <e>", "<cs> my lords let me answer the last of my noble friends supplementaries first <e> <s> the answer is no a british overseas citizens passport provides as do other british passports clear evidence of the holders identity and national status <e> <s> it is a valid travel document and no problems such as those referred to in the question have to our knowledge arisen anywhere else <e> <s> on the other point that my noble friend raised i can confirm that all new british dependent territory passports as issued will include the revised wording and existing passports will of course be amended as they come due for renewal but anyone who holds one of these passports and wants it changed right away can have that done <e>", "<cs> my lords i remember only too well the proceedings on the british nationality act to which the noble lord refers and indeed the interventions of my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter on the question of gibraltar <e> <s> as the noble lord rightly says an amendment was carried in your lordships house in that connection <e> <s> but the matters referred to in the question as it happens do not strictly speaking arise out of that act <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot claim to have seen the document to which the noble lord refers but if he will send me a copy i shall be happy to look at it <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a view for which i fancy the noble lord will not find much support in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me to intervene briefly may i ask whether he will say to which right under the treaty of guarantee he is referring <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord lord spens was successful in the ballot and elected to debate the question of cyprus i am sure that neither he nor any of your lordships realised how timely such a debate would be <e> <s> obviously your lordships will expect me to devote much of my speech to yesterdays news of a purported declaration of independence by the turkish cypriot community <e> <s> nevertheless i think it right to begin by setting yesterdays events in a broader perspective <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the case that there has been a real decline in the amount of our contribution to this particular programme <e> <s> we remain a major contributor among those who do make funds available <e> <s> the governments policy has been to give greater priority to bilateral aid and in general for our contributions to multilateral agencies to reflect more closely our economic strength <e> <s> that consideration has been reflected in the amount we have been able to make available to this particular programme <e> <s> as to the second point made by the noble lord about there being fewer specialists and others employed i am afraid it was the case that the undp devised some <e>", "<cs> my lords generally speaking we have a good deal of admiration for the work of the undp <e> <s> we have some reservations from time to time but the work the undp does is good and we should like to contribute to it as much as we can within the resources that we can make available <e>", "<cs> my lords nobody pretends that the undp by itself less still our contribution to it will solve the problems to which the noble lord has referred <e> <s> but perhaps they need to be considered in the context of our total aid budget which exceeds million <e>", "<cs> that is one point of view my lords and a perfectly respectable point of view <e> <s> but the fact of the matter is that the brandt commission was not so clear as to where the large resources for which it called were to come from <e>", "<cs> my lords neither the united kingdom nor any other member of the undp has the <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord there is no connection between the size of contribution from a particular country and the amount of money spent in that country by the undp <e> <s> there is a large proportion of undp funds spent in the united kingdom <e> <s> the reason why there is such a large proportion is because we can offer the services required and offer good value for money <e>", "<cs> my lords doubtless there will be some people who think we ought to give more but the fact is that we must cut our coat according to our cloth <e> <s> if we were to provide a greatly excessive aid programme like the one foreshadowed when we came into office we would soon find ourselves beggared and not able to afford anything <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords <e> <s> the noble lord lord bishopston asked a number of questions <e> <s> why was it he asked for example that the united kingdom and french forces were not to be included in the negotiations <e> <s> that point has been answered on a number of occasions from this dispatch box <e> <s> the united kingdom and the french forces are not intermediate range forces but are strategic forces and they constitute but a tiny fraction of the total forces held by the soviet union in that category of weapon <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise if i misheard the noble lord but i thought that he did refer to the shooting down <e> <s> the grenada matter is of course something entirely different and therefore something quite outside the ken of this particular matter <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> if we were to follow the course proposed by the noble lord lord bishopston we would be giving the soviets exactly what they want without getting so much as an iota in return <e> <s> that would not be fair or successful negotiation <e> <s> as to what is the present soviet position i must say that it is rather difficult to ascertain <e> <s> for example they make proposals in geneva which they then publicly withdraw attributing them to the united states <e> <s> from what we understand of the latest so-called offer which they made the other day they are still proposing to keep more than ss missiles within the range of western europe while demanding that there should be no such deployment in europe of united states missiles <e> <s> such a monopoly remains as i have said unacceptable to the western alliance <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that the united states government are negotiating in good faith <e> <s> they have made what has come to be known as the zero option proposal which apparently was not acceptable to the soviet union <e> <s> the united states then made some adjustments and amendments to that proposal and those too apparently were not acceptable to the soviet union <e> <s> all that seems to be acceptable to the soviet union in these talks is a total monopoly on their side of this category of weapons <e> <s> i do not understand how that could be thought to be fair or reasonable <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that the noble lord has not been following these matters too closely in recent weeks if he says that there has been no change in the united states position in recent days <e> <s> it was as recently as th november that the united states offered the russians a precise figure in terms of the number of warheads in terms of a global ceiling was the figure <e> <s> the russians have refused this as they have refused all previous offers <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i agree that it is deeply regrettable that these talks have for the time being at least come to an end <e> <s> i hope the soviet union will urgently reconsider its position and return to the negotiating table as soon as may be <e> <s> in the meantime i am certain that we must be steadfast in our plans to continue with the deployment of intermediate range missiles so that the monopoly that the soviet union possesses can be brought into balance <e>", "<cs> my lords the difficulty is matching the russians words with their deeds <e> <s> they have professed all sorts of peaceful intentions like the helsinki final act and the united nations charter and what do we have <e> <s> breaches of human rights left right and centre in the united kingdom not to mention the invasion of afghanistan <e>", "<cs> my lords i warmly welcome the statement of the secretary general of the united <e>", "<cs> my lords the difficulties to which the noble lord refers are of course in the forefront of everyones mind <e> <s> that is why it is important to move forward to achieve an agreement in these matters <e> <s> that is why we hope sincerely that the russians will return to the inf talks in geneva <e> <s> that is why we also hope that progress can he made in the other international for a to which i have referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to say that the noble lord is not quite right in all that <e> <s> the cruise missiles have been very fully tested <e> <s> i also assure him that they need less than a range of mountains by which to navigate <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree that we need to go on talking just as often and long as we can <e> <s> that is why we hope that the soviet union will return to these talks <e> <s> it is the soviet union that has left the table at geneva and not the united states <e> <s> but the noble lord may be reassured that the talks in the other disarmament for a are continuing as i have said and we know of no reason to think that they should not do just that <e> <s> the noble lord is right we need to go on talking <e> <s> i also agree with him that it is sometimes better if these talks are conducted rather more confidentially than has always been the case in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been no war in europe for nigh on years <e> <s> i believe that that has been because we have succeeded in deterring the soviet union or anyone else from perpetrating aggression upon us <e> <s> it is our policy to continue to deter and i believe that we shall be successful in that <e>", "<cs> my lords the negative aspect of the statement today is of course the departure of the soviet union from the negotiating table in geneva <e> <s> a positive aspect would be the return of the soviet union to that negotiating table and that is what i hope will happen <e>", "<cs> my lords i imagine that the noble lord is relying upon a letter to <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact remains that the passage in the book to which the noble lord refers includes the words which i read out just now and for reasons best known to the author those words were omitted from the letter which recently appeared in <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed consultations would of course take place in the kind of circumstances to which my noble friend refers <e> <s> but before the bases could be used there would have to be more than consultations it would have to be with the agreement of the british prime minister <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the united states is of course our closest ally and the fact remains that the weapons which they have in this country cannot be used without the agreement of the british prime minister <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a wholly different matter <e> <s> grenada is nothing to do with nato <e> <s> there was prior consultation on that matter and the united kingdoms views were as the noble lord knows made clear <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is of course quite right that the whole purpose of our <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter for noble lords opposite not for me <e>", "<cs> my lords the events which the noble lord describes and which dr kissinger describes in this book were not of course launching weapons or using weapons or anything like it <e> <s> it was raising the level of alertness i think by two points <e> <s> the noble lord will know that the americans have a five-point system in this particular regard <e> <s> therefore it is not the case that there was any risk <e> <s> as i say there was only this raising the alert <e> <s> such raising the alert does not require the prior agreement of the united kingdom <e> <s> had any question arisen of the use of those bases for purposes of the sort that the noble lord has in mind then of course the agreement of the british prime minister would have been required <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i said they were under joint command at the greenham common base and not under united states air force command <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will allow me to amplify that in correspondence for it is not in fact as simple a matter as some people would have us believe <e> <s> with regard to the rapiers as i have said the fact is that the royal air force regiment squadrons in the united kingdom employed to defend the american bases are under british command <e> <s> we have agreed to provide these squadrons to overcome a particularly difficult problem which has emerged <e> <s> it is a measure of the strength of the nato alliance and our own flexibility that we could respond to the difficulties that arose in the way that we did <e> <s> the rapier arrangement reflects nothing but credit on all those involved and i hope your lordships will agree with that <e>", "<cs> my lords the decision to fire the missile is a matter not for the raf regiment not for the united states forces on the base but for the president and the prime minister <e>", "<cs> my lords the studies to which i referred are being carried out to validate just the sort of views to which my noble friend has referred and i hope that we shall be able to reach a view of our own on this matter in the not too distant future <e> <s> as for the question of further support that too i think will have to await the outcome of the studies to which i have referred but it is perhaps worth saying that the department of trade and industry have already provided financial support in respect of a pre-production order of one particular airship and that any further applications would have to be considered in the context of the amount sought and of the limited funds available <e>", "<cs> my lords that is indeed the particular airship which my department is currently studying <e>", "<cs> my lords the truth of the matter i must say is that airships may have a serious role to play for military purposes <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord would not wish to be misled on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i doubt whether anyones interests are served by extreme language of any kind particularly in the circumstances that surround the problems of that part of the world <e> <s> the noble lord asked me about the importance of our relationship with south africa <e> <s> i should have thought that that importance was self-evident having regard to the fact that we have such long-standing relations of most kinds with that country <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords the words of my right honourable and learned friend are exactly the policy of her majestys government as the noble lord would expect <e> <s> we have never deviated from our view that it is for those in south africa to decide upon their own political development but we have made it clear that <e>", "<cs> my lords the views of the noble lord in these matters are always interesting and sometimes unusual <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier i think extreme expressions of view of any kind are not particularly helpful in this context <e> <s> i do not think that there has ever been any doubt about the united kingdoms attitude to apartheid <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> i think it is wrong to imagine that all the right is on one side in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i do not have a formula at my fingertips for a total solution to the problems of that part of the worldand particularly the internal problems to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> the new constitution following from the referendum to which the noble lord has referred is a step in the right direction but a very tiny step and does not go anything like far enough <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that i cannot conceive of a situation where airborne brigade would be deployed without parliament having some interest in the matter but i think that i should want to stop short of giving the assurance for which the noble lord asks <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that the events of last year would have persuaded us to prepare for the unexpected <e> <s> therefore i cannot tell the noble lord where in particular we might wish to deploy this unit <e>", "<cs> my lords as i say we came to the conclusion that we needed to make some enhancement to our ability to intervene in areas where vital british interests are threatened outside the immediate nato area and that was why we made the changes in the enhancements to this brigade most particularly as i have said an air-transportable capability <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not say that at all no <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i quite follow the gist of the noble lords question <e> <s> i would not wish to go further than i have done <e> <s> clearly we have enhanced the facilities that existed to enable deployments to be made when we think they are appropriate in british interests <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that one wants to overstress the trade relationship between the united kingdom and guinea <e> <s> we constitute only per cent <e> <s> of their supplies and take only about per cent <e> <s> of their exports <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will recall before today i have answered questions about the criteria that we apply in these considerations <e> <s> it is not for me today at any event to pass judgment one way or another on president skou tours rgime although of course we seek to condemn breaches of human rights wherever they may occur <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord may recall from earlier exchanges that he and i have had on this subject the guinean debt was rescheduled i think in the debt amounting then i think to about million since which time we have received only one payment under the rescheduling arrangements <e> <s> they are now substantially in arrears therefore not only with ourselves but with the world at large <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the united states administration have made absolutely clear their commitment to a strategy of deterrence <e> <s> in his annual report to congress for the fiscal year mr weinberger reiterated this strategy <e> <s> he said <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly hope with the noble lord that the stockholm conference will produce the sort of results to which the noble lord has <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord jenkins has already said there is a need to have a strategy of flexible response although i appreciate that the noble lord does not agree with that <e> <s> we have such a strategy within the policy of deterrence to which i have referred and we need to be able to respond at any level <e>", "<cs> my lords the motives of the noble lord lord jenkins are for him and for him alone although i must say that i share some of the views of my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords as i say our policy is one of flexible response <e> <s> that includes the capability to respond with conventional weapons if the occasion so requires <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that it would be highly desirable for the inf and start <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that there is opposition to the american point of view in these matters from some people in this country <e> <s> i believe it is a tiny minority of our people as evidenced at the last general election <e>", "<cs> my lords there is always room for speculation about the horrors of a nuclear war and the severity of its effects but nato is more interested in ensuring that war does not start in the first place <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right when he points out that nato has been reducing the number of nuclear warheads particularly in the european theatre in recent times and that we have plans to reduce them even further whereas as my noble friend said at the same time the soviet union have withdrawn just a few very old warheads and introduced new triple-warheaded missiles <e>", "<cs> my lords it is unhappily not for her majestys government alone to achieve a <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not yet have a date for the resumption of the start talks <e> <s> we hope that there will be a date before long but as i believe i mentioned to your lordships the other day the soviet union are apparently reconsidering their position in this particular area <e> <s> if that is so and if it leads to a more constructive attitude of the soviet union in these talks then a short delay in setting a date for restarting them will be well worth it <e> <s> they have however recently agreed to a date to restart the mbfr talks in vienna and that is much to be welcomed <e>", "<cs> my lords i greatly regret that the soviet union found it necessary to leave the inf talks when they did <e> <s> it is a pity that they had not been more flexible during the time that the talks have continued or that the proposals they ever brought forward were ones which simply maintained the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is right when he says that the chief protagonists in these discussions are the soviet union and the united states <e> <s> however the united kingdom does play an important part and we shall certainly continue to do so not least in the current conference in stockholm to which the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos referred <e>", "<cs> my lords nobody doubts that the present nuclear arsenals in the world ought to be reduced <e> <s> this government will hasten to support any measure of that kind which was as i have said both balanced and verifiable <e> <s> as to the name calling to which the noble lord referred perhaps he will convey his point to mr gromyko following his recent speech in stockholm <e>", "<cs> my lords we will certainly as i have said continue to play our part in these matters but the chief protagonists if that is the right word must remain the united states and the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords the originality of the noble lords views never ceases to impress me <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that the appointment of a new minister is the right answer to every problem that may emerge <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that the problem of disarmament is one which exercises not only my right honourable friend the secretary of state for defence but also my right honourable and learned friend the foreign secretary and indeed other senior members of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord jenkins of putney has drawn our attention to a particular facet of a subject which he ensures is discussed very regularly in your lordships house that is nuclear defence and arms control policy <e> <s> i make no complaint of that <e>", "<cs> my lords yes conceivably but not necessarily <e> <s> as part of our efforts to ensure that the strategy of deterrence continues to be effective we have to consider how to deter the warsaw pact from any temptation to take advantage of its superiority in conventional forces in europe <e> <s> i do not propose to burden your lordships with a long string of figures but the overall trend is clear <e> <s> as the international institute for strategic studies has noted recently the conventional balance over the last years has slowly but steadily moved in favour of the east <e> <s> at the same time we have largely lost the technology edge whereby quality would substitute for quantity <e>", "<cs> my lords because if the soviet union is faced with uncertainty then surely it will think twice and perhaps long before it is so foolish as to launch an attack upon us <e> <s> indeed i hope and indeed i believe that in the end they will discard that option <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is no doubt right that a war could conceivably happen by mistake <e> <s> that is why we go to such lengths to see that <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i was asked that question at an earlier moment during my remarks <e> <s> yes the answer is that we might conceivably use nuclear weapons in response to a conventional attack but not necessarily so <e>", "<cs> my lords nobody regrets more than i do the accidents to which my noble friend has referred but there are a number of different criteria which must be satisfied before we can justify the installation of the equipment <e> <s> so far we or more accurately the caa has been able to see its way clear to install the equipment only at the airport that i have mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am conscious that in rising to speak a second time in this debate i may do so only with your lordships permission and i hope i have it <e> <s> if i have may i start by saying how grateful we all are to the noble lord lord ezra for initiating what has been a most useful and timely debate on the european community as we embark upon a new phase of the negotiations on the future under the new presidency <e> <s> may i also say how much i enjoyed the maiden speech of my noble friend lord fanshawe <e> <s> it was i believe a particularly remarkable maiden speech and i hope that we hear my noble friend again very soon and often thereafter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am advised that the germans still have some reservations about the programme and that we are not alone in wishing to see a source for the money required before the go-ahead is given <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose it does if you put it in those words <e> <s> but we hope very much that it will not come to that and that it will be possible to persuade the irish if they take some different view as to the merits of whatever proposals are then for discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord kimberley in his characteristically informed way has raised a subject which is both of importance and understandably of interest to many of your lordships <e> <s> i trust however that my noble friend will not be too disappointed or even surprised if i say at the outset that it will be some little while yet before my right honourable friend the secretary of state will be able to announce any decision on the procurement of a new surface-to-surface guided weapon for the royal navy <e> <s> i am afraid therefore i can only say that a decision will be taken as soon as is practicable and possible words which will be not unfamiliar to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords if there was some important part of the speech which they did not wish to approve they could have done so had they so chosen <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that there is a problem as the noble lord suggests <e> <s> in the falkland islands there is a considerable quantity of land available for purchase by those who desire to do so <e> <s> if a problem arises over the shortage of land as i have said the government would be willing to look at the matter further <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right my noble friend was recently in the falkland islands and raised this matter with a number of the people with whom she had discussions <e> <s> finance is available on various terms <e> <s> perhaps i could write to the noble lord giving some of the details <e>", "<cs> my lords we made clear at the time that we deplored the recent south african military operations and that angolan sovereignty should be fully respected <e> <s> the south africans have now announced the disengagement from angola of their forces <e> <s> we hope this will be fully implemented <e> <s> we hope too that renewed diplomatic contacts will help to reduce tensions in the region and help progress towards a namibian settlement <e>", "<cs> my lords we of course supported security council resolution which referred to this matter in fairly trenchant terms <e> <s> we are happy to see that the views of the united nations i presume and of those who have made their views known to the <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is of course quite right in saying that the presence of foreign troops in this part of

he does from his position on that side of the house <e> <s> be that as it may i think that the problems that we are discussing this afternoon the various military operations or invasions as some would call them only point to the fact that a solution must be found <e> <s> we believe it is best found not by violence but by discussion and by negotiation <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that they will but i cannot give an assurance that that will be so because of course it is not for me <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend will be aware that we do not necessarily see a linkage between the matter to which my noble friend refers and other matters in that part of the world but i can assure my noble friend that the angolan government are in no doubt about our views <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to tell the noble lord that matters are not as simple as he may imagine and that progress will not be made easily or i fear soon <e> <s> the british government stand ready to make whatever contribution they can

television serials <e> <s> in relation to the last part our position i made clear in the answer i gave to my noble friend just now <e>", "<cs> my lords i was answering the question that i thought the noble lord had put to me about the linkage between the withdrawal of the south africans and the withdrawal of the cubans <e> <s> the answer that i gave was the same answer i gave to my noble friend

the contrary the british forces there have played a useful role by patrolling and by providing a guard for the ceasefire talks <e> <s> as i have said they are still there and playing a useful role <e>

question that the noble lord put to me our contribution to the main replenishment of ida will be million out of billion dollars which as the noble lord says is per cent <e> <s> but that does not take into account any supplementary contribution which we may make <e> <s> that supplementary contribution was taken into account in the earlier contribution of about per cent <e> <s> which we made to ida

to take this forward <e> <s> we believe as again i think i said earlier this week that a united nations effort in this area would be desirable and we shall support any realistic proposals that may come forward <e> <s> that really is in essence how we sec the future <e>", "<cs> my lords they will doubtless get the latter in due course <e> <s> as for the former i am aware that consideration is being given to that already <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord suggested that he knew more than i did about this matter the noble lord knows more than i do about practically every matter so that that is hardly surprising <e> <s> as for the comparison between what i have said today and what i said earlier this week i can only tell the noble lord that circumstances have been changing very swiftly indeed in this matter and the answers i gave to the noble lord earlier this week reflected the situation in the governments view at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords i can happily give that assurance and i can also assure the noble baroness that we remain in full communication with our mission in beirut <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is of course the greatest expert in united nations procedures indeed i believe he himself drafted many of them <e> <s> it may well be that he has stolen a march on me in that matter <e> <s> clearly it would be right in these circumstances if not in all for us to know the views of the lebanese themselves before this matter was initiated <e>", "<cs> my lords the different contributors to the multi-national force as it was in beirut of course have to look after their own forces in their own way but i can assure the noble lord that we are in close consultation with all the other members <e>", "<cs> my lords we understand that both france and italy are considering their position but i also understand that no announcement has yet been made by either country <e>", "<cs> my lords when i speak later i will have to disclaim what the noble lord says <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord dean of beswick has raised a subject today which commands considerable interest at the present time <e> <s> i hope i may therefore explain again to your lordships why the government found it necessary to take the decision that they did in this matter as well as answering some of the specific questions put to me by noble lords tonight <e> <s> as some of your lordships will be aware and as the noble lord lord mccarthy reminded us my right honourable friend the foreign and commonwealth secretary this morning appeared <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not hear the broadcast to which the noble lord refers but i think <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a matter of choice as to how much detail on these particular kind of issues it is right to put into a statement <e> <s> my right honourable friend was certainly willing to clarify that point when he was subsequently asked <e>", "<cs> my lords i assure the noble lord that the government have broken no agreements with the civil service as he suggests <e>", "<cs> the issue put by the noble lord lord harris of greenwich is one that i have answered <e>", "<cs> perhaps i have identified the wrong noble lord <e> <s> perhaps it was the noble lord lord dean <e> <s> these measures have been taken solely at the governments initiative <e> <s> like us the united states authorities were naturally concerned about industrial action at gchq <e> <s> but at no time did they apply any sort of pressure on us to take any action <e> <s> when told of the governments action on th january they regarded it as sensible but saw it as our own affair <e> <s> i can also confirm that the security commission report on the prime case did not propose the recent changes in condition of service at gchq <e>", "<cs> my lords the united states is i suppose our closest ally <e> <s> i am afraid that it would take me more than a few moments to explain to the noble lord the channels of communication that we have with the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords i have endeavoured to answer quite a number of points during the speech i have made <e> <s> i will cull the words of the noble lord and if there is anything i can add i will write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly the matters to which the noble baroness refers are among the very important issues that the caa will be considering but there are other issues as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i could not anticipate the outcome of the review which the caa is presently undertaking but doubtless the sort of matters to which the noble earl refers will emerge from it <e>", "<cs> my lords the british airways contribution to the civil aviation authority on this matter is one of no fewer than submissions but it will be studied carefully like all the rest <e> <s> the view to which the noble lord refers is i know the view of british airways but there are other views as well <e>", "<cs> yes of course my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of the transfer of routes is one that i have no doubt will be considered by the caa in the course of its study <e> <s> there are certainly no plans for the sort of steps that the noble baroness has in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that <e> <s> it is the civil aviation authority that is giving consideration to this matter <e> <s> they will make their views known to my right honourable friend in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that under my noble friends chairmanship british airways has made a remarkable turnround <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have made clear to your lordships on many occasions it is the policy of all members of the nato alliance including the usa to prevent war through the strategy of deterrence <e> <s> in october nato ministers endorsed a programme to reduce the number of the alliances nuclear warheads in europe to the lowest level for years <e> <s> and at the start talks the united states made a proposal for substantial reductions in warheads on strategic ballistic missiles <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to see a reduction in the number of warheads <e> <s> that is why i hope that the soviet union will return to the negotiating table <e>", "<cs> my lords as i recall having mentioned to the noble lord before we hope that the soviet union will return to the start negotiating table but they have not yet agreed a date <e>", "<cs> my lords the initiative to resume the start talks now rests with the soviet union <e> <s> it is they who are considering the date upon which they can return <e> <s> as for the other talks to which the noble lord refers us the noble lord will understand that the main protagonists in this area are the main superpowers the united states and the soviet union <e> <s> but the united kingdom of course stands ready to make whatever contribution we can <e>", "<cs> my lords the precise number of warheads possessed by either side is not a matter which is readily ascertainable but my noble friend may well be right <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that there is scope for mutual and balanced reductions by both sides and that is why as i said in answer to the first supplementary question this afternoon we hope that the soviet union will come back to the negotiating table so that that may happen <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend is suggesting that verification ought to be an important feature of any new agreement and i quite agree <e>", "<cs> my lords that is certainly one of the possibilities that has been canvassed <e> <s> but it is perhaps worth saying that difficulties have arisen in both of the separate talks that have been proceeding so far and it is not immediately clear that those difficulties would automatically disappear if the talks were merged <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord has forgotten that the replacement of a few sss and sss by sss has been just the process he has described <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it falls to me to correct my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree about the respect in which president banda is held in this country <e> <s> the judicial process in this particular case is of course now complete but there is a procedure for consideration of clemency <e> <s> we understand that under this procedure this case would be referred to the capital sentences review committee who would submit their recommendation to the president <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we shall take every opportunity to express our views to the malawian government in this matter and we certainly think that the humanitarian aspects of this case ought to be paramount <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i agree with the noble baroness and as i say the british government and our european partners are considering what the next step might be <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me that on this rare occasion the noble lord and i are in no disagreement <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of detailed interpretation of american law is not i think for me <e> <s> but i can assure the noble lord that the british government are entirely happy with the arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords i am naturally aware of the view of the opposition in these matters but of course the government fundamentally disagree <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments agreement to the present arrangements of course took account of all the considerations <e>", "<cs> my lords the original understanding was reached if my memory serves me right between the late lord attlee and the late president truman <e> <s> a statement was made at the time and i recall quoting that statement to your lordships <e>", "<cs> with respect my lords that is rather wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend from his position of considerable experience in these matters is of course quite right <e>", "<cs> my lords circumstances have of course changed since the original agreement was reached <e> <s> that is why the agreement is reviewed and has been reviewed every time a new president or a new prime minister comes to office <e>", "<cs> yes of course my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are satisfied that the instructions which govern the use of force by british servicemen are fully compatible with the law of this country <e> <s> we are satisfied too that the competent united states authorities are well aware of our law and that united states servicemen in the united kingdom will at all times respect it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord reads too much into my answer <e> <s> i did not say that <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the intervention of my noble friend and i precisely share his sentiments <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the forces at greenham common are under joint command <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that he was not happy to have served with the united states forces <e> <s> how happy they were to serve with him i am not clear <e>", "<cs> my lords i was nine months old on th december so my recollection is not too clear <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to hear what the noble lord says but as i mentioned i have not heard their views of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lord himself answered his supplementary question when he pointed out that there will always be a few people in any body of men who occasionally break the law <e>", "<cs> my lords i recall that your lordships had an unstarred question on this matter asked if my memory serves me by the noble lord lord kennet when i answered that question at considerable length <e> <s> it may not be appropriate for me to repeat that answer now <e>", "<cs> my lords that order would not be given unless the british prime minister had agreed <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of the ultimate defence of the nuclear facilities at greenham common has been a matter for very considerable comment already <e> <s> but i must emphasise that the arrangements for firing to which the noble lord refers are of course in the very last resort <e>", "<cs> no i beg your lordships pardon yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the principal threat that we face is the threat we face within the nato area <e> <s> but there are other threats too some outside the area and we have to deploy our forces as necessary to meet these threats as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that our naval forces today are stronger than they have ever been in our history <e> <s> the basis of the noble lords supplementary question is therefore in error <e>", "<cs> my lords coming from the noble lord and his noble friends opposite with the ability to say one thing when they mean another that is rather surprising <e>", "<cs> my lords strength is not only measured by the numbers of vessels of a particular type which may be available for service at any time <e> <s> it refers also of course to the fire-power of the weapons that they carry <e>", "<cs> my lords the essential threat which we face to which i referred in answer to the first supplementary question is the threat in europe the threat to nato and the question on the order paper refers principally to that too <e> <s> as i have said our naval forces are more powerful in many ways than they have ever been and that is why they were indeed successful in the south atlantic <e>", "<cs> my lords the admirals remarks were of course designed to refer also to all the nato forces in the western atlantic of which the united kingdom forms only a part <e>", "<cs> my lords it is because the threat is of course greater than it has ever been too <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure my noble friend is right <e>", "<cs> my lords i anticipate that the production work will be divided about half and half <e> <s> at its peak the programme should involve employment amounting to about jobs which will be either preserved or created <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will be aware of the governments general approach to collaborative projects <e> <s> all of them of course involve an investment of one kind or another from the collaborative partners <e> <s> that is one of the matters that have to be considered in regard to the other programme to which the noble lord referred <e>", "<cs> my lords the principal contractors are likely to be westland the british helicopter company and augusta the italian helicopter company so i imagine that the principal creation of jobs will be around and within those companies <e>", "<cs> my lords this has yet to be finally decided <e> <s> the noble lord will appreciate that deliveries of this newly developed helicopter will not take place for some years but the programme will be a very substantial one <e>", "<cs> my lords they will be shared between this country and italy <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking as a defence minister i naturally attach importance to both markets to which my noble friend referred <e> <s> of course my noble friend is quite right <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to confess that i am not quite clear about the answer that i should give to the noble lords question <e> <s> perhaps i may ascertain the answer and write to him <e>", "<cs> yes my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> what usually happens is that the military variant is developed first and then the civil variant follows later <e> <s> in this case both of the variants are being developed side by side <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that with regard to the last supplementary question that the noble baroness has put i would have to say no because the tickets to which the noble baroness refers are sold outside the provisions of the relative air services agreement or the permit issued under it <e> <s> as for the wide range of fares to which she referred i would say that that again is a matter for the airlines themselves to resolve <e> <s> if they see an outlet for their services through a wide range of fares then they should be allowed to propose that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that if it is a question of negotiating with other governments as generally it is then it is a matter for the government themselves and not for the civil aviation authority although the government operate very closely in accordance with the advice of the caa in these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not seen the details of the plan to which the noble baroness refers but if it meets the general criteria to which i have referred then the government would certainly support it <e>", "<cs> my lords scheduled buildings are the liability of the ministry of defence normally under a tenancy agreement in respect of structural repairs and external maintenance of the buildings including any of those which are scheduled or of special historic interest <e> <s> but neither the ministry of defence nor the tenant has any obligation to maintain in full repair any farm building which is redundant for agricultural purposes that is those which no longer have an economic life or are superfluous to present farming activities <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lord is right <e> <s> the ministry of defence as i say in the original answer own a large amount of agricultural <e>", "<cs> my lords i can certainly assure the noble lord that we shall retain no more land than we require for these purposes but i have to say that training land generally in the united kingdom is at a considerable premium <e> <s> i would not think it likely that in the near future we should be able to release any of the land to which the noble lord refers <e>", "<cs> my lords that will depend upon the individual circumstances of the land in question <e> <s> i could not give a blanket answer to my noble friend but if he has a specific case in mind i shall gladly look at it <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right about the study which took place a few years ago <e> <s> despite the shortage we do from time to time dispose of land which we are not using for training purposes <e> <s> that is because in general it is not suitable for that kind of use <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord underhill and to the noble baroness lady burton for their response to this statement <e> <s> in reply to the questions put to me by the noble lord may i say that it is indeed the case that the amount that has been agreed with british aerospace is rather less than that company originally sought by way of launch aid for this particular aircraft project <e> <s> however i can tell the noble lord that the negotiations have been conducted in the best of spirit <e> <s> there has been give and take on both sides and the government too have given way in some particular aspects of the discussions particularly with regard to the rate of dispersement of the funds which we were able to agree to more in line with british aerospaces requirements <e> <s> thus it was that we were able to reach agreement on the sum of money referred to in the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason why it sometimes takes rather a long time to reach a conclusion in these matters is that the government have to be very clear indeed that the project that they are backing is a project that will in due course come to a profitable conclusion because as was not i think referred to in the statement but which i am happy to say now in fact the money is by way of launch-aid <e> <s> a certain proportion of the money will be repaid on a fixed schedule but the remainder of the money will be repaid by means of a levy on sales in due course <e> <s> it is necessary for the government to take a very careful approach to these matters to make sure that the forecasts of the company particularly with regard to sales of the aircraft and the likely size of the market are proper estimates <e> <s> the government have done that and have reached these conclusions <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend that these matters were very much in the governments mind when we conducted these negotiations with british aerospace but i must tell him that the answer as to where the rest of the money will come from must be provided by british aerospace and not by the government <e> <s> british aerospace are now a private-sector company <e> <s> they have the responsibility for these matters and the government are satisfied that they are in a position to do that <e> <s> we would not have proceeded in the way that we have if we had not been so satisfied <e> <s> i might add that the sort <e>", "<cs> my lords the words which the noble lord ascribed to me in the question omitted the reference to the internationally uncompetitive tender which the noble lord i must confess did refer to when he read out the quotation just now <e> <s> that was the important point which i was seeking to make that an internationally uncompetitive tender would have the adverse effects to which i referred <e>", "<cs> my lords the other considerations to which my noble friend referred are of course equally valid <e>", "<cs> my lords i must stand by the answer i gave originally which was that the noble lords quotation from what i said as contained in his original question omitted some very relevant words <e> <s> but the other considerations to which the noble lord referred are certainly to be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a perfectly respectable point of view but it is one which the government will have to examine carefully in this particular case <e>", "<cs> my lords to answer first the second part of that supplementary question if gatwick airport were to be privatised as the noble baroness suggests and i emphasise that no decision let alone announcement has been made on that then all property rights liabilities and obligations of the statutory body would be transferred to any successor company as they stand <e> <s> the position would therefore be unchanged by privatisation or whatever it was decided to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly refresh my memory of the debate to which the noble baroness has referred although i believe that i was speaking from the dispatch box opposite <e> <s> be that as it may circumstances have changed pretty substantially in that time and i have no doubt that a new view is now appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i could describe west sussex county council as a local pressure group <e> <s> it was indeed to that body that the british airports authority gave that undertaking <e> <s> as i said in answer to the noble baroness the rights liabilities and obligations of the statutory body will be transferred to any successor company when and if that should come to pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe there has been a good deal of misunderstanding about the advantages or otherwise which may flow from a two-runway layout at gatwick <e> <s> for example two runways were contructed at heathrow and it has not proved possible in the light of modern standards to use both those runways to the maximum extent <e> <s> if a second runway were to be constructed at gatwick it would only increase the busy rate as it is called in terms of aircraft capacity by about per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of movements at heathrow is i submit another question <e> <s> at any rate and as the noble lord will be aware movements at heathrow will be subject to a limit after terminal comes into use <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to hear that at least one of my noble friends is happy <e>", "<cs> my lords i have endeavoured to explain that were a second runway to be built at gatwick it would offer little in the way of relief to those who live around heathrow <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the employment advantages to which my noble friend has referred are indeed welcome to people who live in the district but the noise of the airplanes is less so <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite correct <e> <s> the difficulty is that the passengers tend to come from the south-east and not the places to which my noble friend refers <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is no doubt quite correct but that is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords the maximum annual number of passengers that we anticipate at gatwick is as i said in my original answer about million when both terminals come into use <e> <s> that predicates about movements a year <e>", "<cs> my lords long-range nuclear-armed ground-launched cruise missiles were appropriately dealt with in the inf talks and following the salt precedent long-range nuclear-armed air-launched cruise missiles on strategic heavy bombers were under discussion in start until the russians discontinued both negotiations in geneva <e> <s> long-range nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles have not yet been clearly classified for the purpose of arms control negotiations they are regarded by the united states and it seems also by the soviet union as strategic weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords the united states administration has stated its readiness to consider all strategic nuclear weapons in the start talks <e> <s> it now only remains for the russians to return to the table <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly hope that the start talks can be reconvened <e> <s> the soviet union has not yet said it is willing to do that but we hope it is and urge it to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that it is as easy as the noble lord suggests <e> <s> we are of course willing to play our part in the various discussions to which the noble lord has referred <e> <s> however it must be recognised that the main forum for discussions of this kind must be a forum involving above all the two super powers <e>", "<cs> my lords not for the first time i do not entirely follow the drift of the noble lords supplementary question <e> <s> however i would like to see a reduction in the level of nuclear weapons across the world provided that that can be achieved in a balanced and verifiable manner <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right that verification has often proved to be the stumbling block in these negotiations <e> <s> that is why we made important new verification proposals at the current talks in geneva in connection with chemical weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is referring to sea-launched cruise missiles as perhaps he is and which are the subject of this question i agree that they are somewhat difficult to verify <e> <s> that is why we must get round the table and talk about it <e> <s> we are ready to do that at the start talks <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and gallant lord is of course quite correct that there is a difficulty of that kind <e> <s> there are other difficulties too <e> <s> however i believe that these difficulties ought to be capable of solution but we must get round the table to talk about the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer was as i gave it <e>", "<cs> my lords with your permission i should like to repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the minister of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs about the recent attack on a british vessel near bandar khomeini <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their reception to this statement <e> <s> i shall reply first to the points made by the noble lord lord bishopston <e> <s> we heard as far back as st march that an attack had taken place <e> <s> the iraqis announced as much but it was only much more recently namely yesterday that we heard that a british ship was involved <e> <s> i should explain that the ships within the iranian convoy are required by the iranians to maintain radio silence and thus it was i imagine that <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the owners are resident in guernsey but i do not think that i can shed any more light than that <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that we are in close touch with all our allies including the united states on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend was as much at a loss to decide from where the right honourable gentleman had obtained his answer as he was regarding the noble lord <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not think it is right at all <e> <s> if the noble lord will study again the remarks of my noble friend he will see that my noble friend was as much at a loss as i said just now as to the answer from the right honourable gentleman dr john gilbert as he was about the observations of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend is right <e> <s> that may be the cause of one of the noble lords misapprehensions <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is entitled to his point of view but i am afraid i do not agree with him <e>", "<cs> my lords i have in fact provided one or perhaps two written answers to the noble lord lord jenkins of putney giving him the detail of the matter <e> <s> as the noble lord opposite may not be aware we have answered on several occasions that there are about of these facilities <e>", "<cs> my lords the position is as i and my noble friends have told the noble lord on a number of occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i should like to repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for defence about the future development of the organisation for defence <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their reception of this statement <e> <s> in answer to the noble lord lord bishopston i must say that it is not yet possible to state the precise amount of savings that will flow from these proposals either in terms of money or in terms of manpower <e> <s> at this stage these are outline proposals only which are submitted for consultation purposes <e> <s> the consultation process during the coming months will put flesh on the bones of these ideas <e> <s> after that process it will be possible to make a more accurate estimate of the savings that will flow from them <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may answer the last question first the single service staffs will continue as before but with a rather different role and not necessarily in the same form as at present <e> <s> this is one of the things which will emerge from the consultation <e> <s> i hope i have answered my noble friends point <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for omitting to answer my noble friends first question <e> <s> the ministerial responsibility in the ministry of defence as in any other departments resides in the secretary of state himself <e> <s> the position of other ministers is that they carry out such tasks as he may delegate to them and that position will remain <e> <s> i should add also that ministers will retain their membership of the defence council and i think of the service boards <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may again take the last point first the personnel to whom the noble lord refers have hitherto reported direct to the secretary of state and not through the permanent under-secretary <e> <s> the answer to his first question is that the new central staff will be a greatly enhanced body with a new advisory and consultative role with regard to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the royal ordnance factories of course are the subject of legislation which is currently going through parliament and which will no doubt come to your lordships house before long <e> <s> the dockyards will remain part of the navy department as before <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate has ranged widely over many of the key issues which are vital to nothern ireland and your lordships have raised a number of points of specific concern <e> <s> as noble lords will appreciate i come new to most to the topics covered in this debate and i should like to record my thanks to those noble lords who have been able to give me advance notice of some of the points that they were proposing to raise this evening <e> <s> time is marching on and we are now much later than had been anticipated or at least later than i had anticipated <e> <s> i hope therefore that your lordships will forgive me if i do not deal in detail with the large number of points that have been raised <e> <s> i promise faithfully to browse through the pages of <e>", "<cs> my lords if i misheard the noble lord i apologise <e> <s> i believe he is right in correcting me on that <e> <s> he did indeed refer to what he called the double guarantee and i misinterpreted that <e> <s> it is another indication i am afraid of my inexperience in northern ireland matters <e> <s> the government have repeatedly made it clear that there can be no question of altering northern irelands constitutional status as an integral part of the united kingdom without the freely-given consent of the majority of its people <e> <s> we are committed to the principle of self-determination enshrined in section of the northern ireland constitution act <e> <s> to proceed on any other basis would be wrong in principle and disastrous in practice in the governments view <e> <s> it is beyond doubt that a clear majority of the people in northern ireland favour the retention of the union <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i do not think that it would be appropriate for me to give details of how the price was arrived at <e> <s> i can say that it happened after negotiations with the falkland islands company <e> <s> i can <e>", "<cs> my lords that depends upon how you calculate the value of similar land <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the case of course that compulsory purchase could have been used to acquire this land but as it was possible to reach agreement by negotiation the government preferred to reach their conclusions that way <e> <s> as for the value of other land in the islands there is no single figure as the noble lord perhaps suggests <e> <s> indeed land prices in the falkland islands are based not on the acreage of land but rather on its productivity measured for example by the number of sheep that it could sustain <e>", "<cs> my lords there were certain facilities on the land that has been acquired and that too had to be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a confidential matter between the government and the falkland islands company <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord is suggesting that we should have confiscated the land required from the falkland islands government <e> <s> that was the sort of thing that we set out to stop when we sought to remove the argentinians <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier in reply to the noble lord lord beswick there were other considerations as well for example severance of the companys land and damage sustained to other property and earnings as a result <e> <s> when i was talking about confiscation to the noble lord lord bishopston just now and i agree of course that there are or would be compulsory purchase powers available but the government took the view that these were not appropriate in this case i was of course referring to confiscation without any compensation at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to have to tell your lordships that there is no mine clearance going on in the falkland islands at the moment <e> <s> as your lordships may recall from a written answer i gave to a question the other day we have had to say that we cannot proceed at the moment to further mine clearance because of the nature of the mines involved <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said this is a confidential matter between <e>", "<cs> as i have said this is a confidential matter between the government and the owners of the land <e> <s> when land is acquired by private treaty such as in this case it is almost always confidential with regard to price <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot give that assurance but i can say that the price referred to in a newspaper report which i saw on sunday is not correct <e>", "<cs> my lords the company from whom we are purchasing the land namely the falkland islands company <e>", "<cs> my lords if the british government had sought to acquire this land by a compulsory purchase arrangement the price would have been subject to independent arbitration and the government took that into account in reaching their agreement with the falkland islands company <e>", "<cs> my lords when i said that the figure given in the press report was inaccurate i was referring not to the price per acre hut to the total sum included in that report <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have available to them a number of advisers on these matters and all their views were taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord may be aware the property services agency is normally the agency that advises the government in these matters and in this particular case it was indeed the governments principal adviser <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their response to this statement <e> <s> i shall pick up as many of the points made by the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos as i can <e> <s> i am not sure i agree with the noble lord that the result of this council meeting was wholly negative <e> <s> certainly we would have wished that the council would have reached a decision on the regulations which i referred to in the statement so that our refund could have proceded without further delay <e> <s> as i say agreement has now been reached between the council and the european parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid not without disproportionate effort <e>", "<cs> my lords the normal procedure is that the documents should be returned when the work on them has been completed and they are no longer <e>", "<cs> my lords all the answers that we give to these questions are as straightforward as we can make them <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that the documents will be returned as soon as work on them has been completed <e> <s> indeed a good number have been returned already <e> <s> as for the suggestion that the government have withdrawn these documents because they are in some way embarrassing or inconvenient i can assure the noble lord that that is not the case and would not be possible under the act in question <e>", "<cs> my lords lam afraid that i cannot do that <e> <s> as i said to the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos this is a continuing process <e> <s> documents are continually coming from the pro and hack again <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that anybody has requested to see these documents but i must confess that the public record office has been closed for a short period recently because of problems with the air conditioning system <e>", "<cs> my lords the documents are being studied by officials in the foreign and commonwealth office in order that we may have our minds refreshed as to what they contain <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that there is nothing to hide <e> <s> the problem about photocopying is that the foreign office has something like files a year from the public record office and other government departments have further quantities of documents and so the copying task would be enormous <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect that question goes rather wide of what is on the order paper but of course the governments position with regard to sovereignty is well known <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their most helpful reception of this statement <e> <s> perhaps i can answer some of the points particularly those that do not appear in the open government document put to me by both noble lords <e> <s> first let me deal with the point about numbers that was raised by the noble lord lord bishopston <e> <s> as the statement says it is proposed to increase the territorial army starting in to <e> <s> the present strength of the territorial army is something like so we are looking to increase the numbers by about over that period <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that my noble friend is correct in what he says but i have to say that we are taking great care in the selection of the names of the new units not least because of the intense rivalries as witnessed by my noble friends remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords new weapons are progressively being issued both to the regular forces and in due course to the territorial units and it is those weapons to which i referred <e> <s> if the noble lord would like more detail i shall be happy to write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to have to tell the noble lord that there are now no lee enfields available for issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i have referred already to exercise lionheart which is to take place later this year and which i think i am right in saying will involve or more soldiers many of whom will be territorials <e> <s> it ought to be said that overseas training presents something of a problem for territorials because of course their time is limited and one wants to be sure that they do not spend too much of that valuable time travelling to or from their training areas <e> <s> but wherever there is an opportunity for them to train effectively overseas for example in exercise lionheart this year then that will be taken <e> <s> but i cannot promise that there will be any great extension of overseas training for the territorials within the new proposals to which i am referring today <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall certainly want to do that <e> <s> indeed the statement contains a number of proposals in that direction <e>", "<cs> my lords to answer the last of my noble friends questions first yes there are some increases in the support units implicit in what we have announced today <e> <s> for example there will be another rct squadron another field ambulance and a new ordnance company together with the other units that i have already mentioned <e> <s> i certainly accept what my noble friend says that the steps which we are taking should have some effect on recruitment <e> <s> to be truthful the problem is not so much one of securing a sufficient number of recruits for the territorial army as one of persuading them to remain in the territorial army for longer than they do at present <e> <s> retention is one of the difficulties that we are presently facing and we are doing what we can to overcome that difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that the royal auxiliary air force is to be given pilot training although that is a matter that is under consideration <e> <s> i said that there will be a new army air corps squadron flying helicopters <e> <s> it is anticipated that the pilots for that squadron will in fact be those with former army air corps experience and are not likely therefore to be trained from scratch <e> <s> on the point of the royal auxiliary air force that is a matter which we are considering further <e>", "<cs> no my lords that is not so <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the answers to the questions which the authors wanted to put to admiral woodward had been given to your lordships and to the other place on a number of occasions particularly on th july of last year when my noble friend lady young answered an unstarred question from the noble lord <e> <s> the matters which the noble lord now puts to me are generally of a confidential security nature and cannot therefore be revealed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am interested to hear that the authors did not approach the noble and <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely with the noble lord it is i must say a rather bad book i should also say with regard to the peruvian proposals that they were not received in london until some hours after the general belgrano was sunk <e>", "<cs> my lords turning to the last of the noble lords supplementaries as he knows the general belgrano was assessed as offering a threat to certain units of the task force clearly as somebody behind me has just commented the escorts could not have posed the same threat since they turned tail and fled the moment the general belgrano was sunk <e>", "<cs> my lords the other questions which the noble lord has put to me are i am afraid confidential matters relating to security which are never discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords i have seen reports that they were <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble and gallant lord lord lewin reminded your lordships yesterday he was not consulted by the authors of the book to which i think the noble lord is referring but would have been willing to talk with them had they approached him <e> <s> i cannot therefore comment on the suggestions which the noble lord makes <e> <s> as i said in the main answer the general belgrano was attacked because she posed an unacceptable threat to units of the task force and that remains the position <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely share my noble friends view <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said the belgrano was attacked because she posed an unacceptable threat <e> <s> what your lordships view would have been had that threat developed into an attack upon our task force i do not care to speculate <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree with the noble lord <e> <s> much has been made of the peaceful intentions of the argentine at this time but your lordships may recall that on th april i think it was the security council passed a resolution calling for argentine withdrawal from the falkland islands with which it did not comply <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope there can no longer be any doubt on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am greatly obliged to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords as has been said on many occasions the peruvian peace proposals did not arrive in london until some three hours after the general belgrano was sunk <e> <s> as for the direction in which the general belgrano was sailing at the time that ship had changed its heading on a number of occasions during the day in question and it was not therefore possible to say that she was sailing in any particular direction at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly the general belgrano did pose a threat to units of the task force and that is why the rules on engagement were changed as they were <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that will be possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not suppose that there will be many surplus movements when the day comes <e> <s> the present level of movements is about per annum or at that rate <e> <s> the number is expected to increase to about some time next year or perhaps later this year and we expect that terminal will come into service some time towards the end of next year at which point it will be necessary to reduce the number of movements as i have said <e> <s> the government are presently considering how the allocation of movements will be awarded but we hope very much that so far as is possible it will derive from agreement among the operators <e>", "<cs> my lords the responsibility in the end will i think rest with the british airports authority to ensure that the number of movements is not exceeded and the reason for that is that the number of movements is a condition attached to the planning consent granted for terminal and that consent was of course granted to the british airports authority <e> <s> the government expect and hope that this matter of the allocation of movements will be decided by the scheduling committee which already exists at heathrow and which has existed for some years <e> <s> but the government are considering what further assistance can be given in that regard <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i agree with the noble lord i very much hope that the matter can be resolved or at least a plan can be agreed before the limit formally comes into effect some time towards the end of next year <e> <s> but of course it is not only a question of the number of routes that are served from heathrow it is also a question of the number of flights on each of the routes and that is i think very much a matter for agreement between the operators <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the effect of the restriction attached to the planning consent for terminal namely that the number of movements at heathrow after the terminal opens shall not exceed per annum <e> <s> therefore the considerations to which the noble lord refers were very much in the minds of ministers when that planning consent was granted <e>", "<cs> my lords the scheduling committee already exists <e> <s> it has existed for some years and it consists of all the operators or certainly the principal operators at heathrow and i believe that it is already in fact considering this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the planning consent for that particular development is still under consideration and i cannot anticipate what might be the outcome of that consideration <e> <s> however i imagine and i speak without a note on this matter that the numbers of movements at that particular development if it comes to pass would be very small and i do not think that they would form part of the figure to which i have referred <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said the scheduling committee is already empowered to deal with these matters <e> <s> as the noble baroness may be aware for some years there have been restrictions of a finite kind on the night movements at heathrow and the scheduling committee has proved itself well able to deal with that matter <e> <s> therefore i have no reason to doubt that it will feel equally able to deal with the matter now before us <e> <s> the figure of has been public knowledge for quite a long time since the planning consent was granted and i do not think that anyone can suggest that he has not had adequate warning <e>", "<cs> my lords it does appear that the noble lord and i seem to be approaching a meeting of minds on this matter and i am happy for that <e>", "<cs> my lords the civil aviation authority is reviewing the flight crew complement required for aircraft with a maximum total weight authorised not exceeding kilograms engaged in public transport operations <e> <s> any proposals to extend to such aircraft the existing statutory requirements for aircraft above that weight to carry not less than two pilots will be the subject of consultation with the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords that is one point of view which will be taken into account although there are other matters that ought to be considered as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot be precise but i imagine that it will be within months rather than years <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not wish to anticipate the announcement that will be made but i can say that all the contenders were excellent <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i can assure the noble lord that all those factors will be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords the soviet navy does indeed pose an important threat <e> <s> that is why we have to make all the arrangements that we do and spend the money that we do on enhancing our own fleet <e>", "<cs> my lords as i say all these things are taken into account but i would not wish to anticipate the announcement <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not necessarily agree with that <e> <s> but in any event of course the sea eagle to which i believe the noble lord has referred is already in the raf inventory <e>", "<cs> my lords if i were to answer what are frankly rather loaded questions i should be anticipating the statement and i cannot do that <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that the answer to that question is the same as the one i just gave to the noble lord lord beswick <e>", "<cs> my lords the contracts for the purchase have now been exchanged <e> <s> the price paid for the acres was <e> <s> in addition the normal severance compensation has been paid and was assessed to be <e> <s> the construction of the airfield necessitates the resiting of mount pleasant house and other farm facilities and services to enable farming operations to continue the cost of which is <e>", "<cs> my lords we always prefer to acquire land by voluntary agreement rather than compulsory purchase <e> <s> indeed as a result of reaching the voluntary agreement with the owners of this land they were able to grant us a licence to begin work on the aerodrome as a result of which the first runway will now be operational about this time next year <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble lords supplementary question is that the contract has now been signed <e> <s> it had not been signed when the noble lord put to me his original question <e>", "<cs> no my lords the price per acre was in fact as my noble friend recounted <e> <s> the compensation is a quite separate matter which is of course calculated by different means <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> had we gone to compulsory purchase the price would no doubt have been subject to arbitration and our belief is that the amount we have agreed to pay would have been the sort of figure that would have been arrived at by arbitration <e>", "<cs> my lords may i take the noble lords questions in order <e> <s> first yes it was the case that the property services agency were the governments principal but not sole advisers in this matter and indeed they have a number of represen-tatives on the islands at the present time <e> <s> as for the rate per acre that very much depends upon the profitability of the land or rather the number of sheep that it will sustain <e> <s> the noble lord lord shackleton asked me about that on the last occasion on which we discussed this matter <e> <s> the price we have paid reflects the fact that this is in fact rather good land <e> <s> the site is in the middle of a much larger farm and thus the piece of land that we have acquired for the purpose of building the aerodrome has divided that farm up very substantially <e> <s> it was that factor which we took into account in reaching the compensation figure to which i referred <e>", "<cs> my lords that was not the conclusion which the government reached in considering this matter <e> <s> but i would emphasise that this was originally a much larger farm <e> <s> we have taken a substantial piece of land from virtually the middle of the site and i think it is quite reasonable to suggest that we have therefore greatly affected the future viability of that farm <e>", "<cs> my lords that is another question if i may say so but the fact remains that the alterna-tives that confronted us were to acquire the land either by voluntary agreement or else by compulsory purchase <e> <s> had it been by compulsory purchase the price would have been set by arbitration if agreement could not have been reached <e> <s> we have no powers and do not seek to take any powers to confiscate the land <e>", "<cs> my lords the falkland islands company initially offered to donate about half the land required and suggested that the ministry of defence might in turn make a similar contribution in cash towards the cost of a swimming pool in port stanley <e> <s> there would thus have been no real savings to public funds and in any event they did not say what price they would have required for the other half <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asks about the dislocation or the disruption as he suggests <e> <s> i am not a great expert on fanning but i imagine that it is much more difficult to run a farm in two parts with a big aerodrome in the middle than it is to run one particular area <e>", "<cs> my lords i am greatly obliged to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i am very sorry to have to say that a major fire broke out at five oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that i do not agree with the noble lord about that <e> <s> as to the question of a swimming pool i hope that the falkland islanders will not have to wait another hundred years <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that we keep all the realistic scenarios however hypothetical in mind and so the answer to his question must be yes <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend may well be right but then the wording of questions on the order paper is not a matter for me <e>", "<cs> my lords i am lost in admiration for the noble lords fertile imagination as for the question of launching nuclear weapons from this country that is subject to the procedures with which your lordships are by now well familiar and which i have described to your lordships on a number of occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords again the noble lords imagination seems to have run away with him of course the cia has no role in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords that is precisely the purpose for which the hot lines have been established <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of nuclear weapons so far as the western alliance is concerned is to deter the prospect of anyone launching an attack on us <e> <s> they have succeeded in that way for the past years <e>", "<cs> my lords what we have said is that we would never be the first to use any weapon nuclear or otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether that is meant to be a serious supplementary question but i can assure the noble lord that the arrangements are now well established and have worked well for a great many years <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that our undertaking goes further than just not being the first to use nuclear weapons it is not to be the first to use a weapon of any kind <e>", "<cs> my lords as i think the noble lord knows the bbcs former afrikaans service was terminated in <e> <s> i have to say that there are no plans for its reintroduction <e> <s> it is worth noting that broadcasts such as this on the short-wave band require the listener to have a short-wave receiver and that generally speaking the people in south africa appear to prefer the vhs service of the local system <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that they can hear the bbc signals even now but we are in negotiation with the government of the seychelles to build a relay station on those islands and that relay station though intended primarily for east africa will bring benefits as far south as south africa <e>", "<cs> my lords as i say the negotiations with the seychelles government are not yet complete <e> <s> i understand that they are going very well <e> <s> as soon as they are completed the construction of the station can commence and i think that it would take two or three years to build from that time <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble baroness that it would be a good thing for the station in the seychelles to be started as soon as possible <e> <s> but of course that cannot happen until we have the agreement of the seychelles authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords there is already a station on ascension island which is one of the sources of the signals presently beamed towards that part of the world <e> <s> it is some distance from south africa of course and a station on the seychelles would be considerably better <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> our transmissions to eastern europe and to the soviet <e>", "<cs> my lords the signals which are audible in africa consist of first of all those in three african languages swahili somali and hausa <e> <s> in addition special programmes for africa are broadcast in english french and portuguese <e> <s> finally the bbcs arabic service has a very large audience in the north and north-eastern part of africa <e> <s> so i do not think we can be accused of having neglected that continent <e>", "<cs> yes my lords audibility is one of the prime features of the work that is currently going on in regard to the bbc external services <e> <s> we are currently spending something like million on an audibility programme and i hope that some of the problems the noble lord has referred to can thereby be overcome <e>", "<cs> my lords recalling as i do the debate which we had in your lordships house in i think when this matter was discussed at some length and a motion was carried against the government i am well aware of the view put to me by the noble baroness <e> <s> but we have to strike an order of priorities in this matter and i think that we have now got it about right <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by expressing the governments gratitude to your lordships committee for this report <e> <s> it comes most usefully at a time when both remote sensing and digital mapping are at important stages in their development <e> <s> this comprehensive report brings such a welcome focus to both these fields that it is already a much-valued source of reference <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not of course know with any degree of certainty what actions the soviet union would take in the event of a conflict between east and west though no doubt soviet military planning places a high value on the element of surprise and pre-emption <e> <s> it therefore remains the absolute priority of natos defence policy to ensure that such a conflict does not take place <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to say that that is a question to which i could not reply without giving some careful consideration to the answer <e> <s> but of course it is certainly the case that they have many more missiles than they need for their declared defensive purposes <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> that is why our policy is to ensure that no such war should start <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord points to the desirability of further negotiations and discussions on this matter <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord <e> <s> that is why i hope that the russians will return to the negotiating table which they left so unnecessarily a few months ago <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> before we started to deploy the cruise missiles and the pershing ii missiles the soviet union had a monopoly of this kind of weapon <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that the risks of war to which the noble lord has referred are so great as some people imagine <e> <s> not so long ago we had a debate in your lordships house on this subject <e> <s> the fact remains that there has been no war in europe for nigh on years <e> <s> i believe that is the result of the policies that we have pursued during that time <e> <s> it is also true that in recent times the americans have begun withdrawal of about warheads from europe <e> <s> that is something which some people often forget <e>", "<cs> my lords we were talking about the intermediate range land-based systems <e> <s> as the noble lord will know and as i said just now until we started to deploy the cruise missiles and the pershing ii missiles the soviet union had a monopoly of this kind of weapon in the form of the ss <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a question which the noble lord had better put to them <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to that question is that between now and the mid-s that is to say years or so there will be a continuing trend to larger aircraft and therefore it will be quite feasible for the single runway to handle that number of passengers at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think we need to be particularly clever to achieve this <e> <s> the size of aircraft will be progressively increasing between now and the time i have mentioned and i have no doubt that there will be other airports as well which are able to handle this number of passengers from a single runway when the time comes <e>", "<cs> my lords the stansted inquiry is a separate matter <e> <s> as the noble lord may know the inspector has now completed his deliberation on that matter <e> <s> he is i believe preparing his report and he will be submitting that to my right honourable friends shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords i note with interest the noble lords view <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i am entirely persuaded about the merit of the regional airport to which the noble baroness refers <e> <s> but the fact remains that per cent <e> <s> or so of passengers travelling by air from this country prefer to use the south-eastern airports <e>", "<cs> my lords gatwick is operating well below maximum capacity at the present time even given the present size of aircraft <e> <s> as to the possibilities of constructing a second runway at gatwick the government have repeatedly said that <e>", "<cs> my lords planning consent has been granted to the british airports authority to upgrade the northern taxiway at gatwick in order to make it into an emergency runway <e> <s> i hope therefore that the fear of the noble lord can be set at rest <e>", "<cs> my lords that may well have been so but times have moved on considerably since then <e> <s> the government believe that the course we have proposed is the right one <e>", "<cs> my lords air land battle sets out the operational doctrine for the contingencies which the us army might face worldwide <e> <s> it is not agreed nato operational doctrine and is therefore not directly associated with natos strategy of flexible response and forward defence <e> <s> the answer to the second part of the question is no <e> <s> the basing of cruise missiles in the country stems from natos twin track decision of december <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that the air land battle concept does countenance the possible use of nuclear forces in accordance with nato strategy but i can assure the noble lord that the arrangements for the use of the nuclear weapons in this country which he and i have described on a number of occasions are such as i have stated on many occasions namely only in accordance with the wishes of both the british prime minister and the american president <e>", "<cs> my lords there are well established procedures for establishing nato doctrines <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that there is no question of overriding those procedures either for this purpose or for any other <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i can go further than i have already gone <e> <s> if there is concern i believe that that concern is unfounded <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord has seen the document to which he has referred <e> <s> i have a copy of it here and i understand that it is readily available from united states authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend that we always make absolutely certain that the necessary medical care is available in both of the circumstances referred to by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the precise figure of the total number of doctors in the army at present but it is of the order of <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the reason is as follows recruiting is quite good but the difficulty is that we do not always manage to retain these doctors for as long as we would wish <e> <s> we are looking at this matter very carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords an outbreak of glandular fever occurred in the royal military academy sandhurst commencing early in <e> <s> from the onset until march a total of clinical cases were confirmed on the basis of laboratory tests and there were a further cases in which laboratory tests were inconclusive <e> <s> as a result of the disease cadets were back-termed and two were medically boarded and fell below retention standards <e> <s> i am wholly satisfied with the level of medical care available at the academy <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to my noble friend that is another question <e> <s> as i stated in my original answer only two cadets out of the or more who contracted the disease have had to leave the academy and not continue <e>", "<cs> my lords i am advised that this disease is vey difficult to diagnose and singularly difficult to control <e> <s> in fact many cases are never diagnosed <e> <s> there is no vaccine against it and some per cent <e> <s> of healthy adults can be carriers <e> <s> the disease is carried in the throat and is fed by coughing and sneezing <e> <s> however i am pleased to say that there are now only four or five cadets still suffering from the after-effects of this outbreak <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> the origins of this bill are to be found in two recent documents the house of commons select committee report of on transport in london and the governments white paper of july last year on public transport in london <e> <s> one message emerged quite clearly from these documents <e> <s> it was that the arrangements for the political and financial control of londons public transport established in the s have not worked well <e> <s> the select committee concluded that a better deal was needed for the passenger in london and that the responsibility for public transport in london should be removed from the greater london council <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so that is a point which might be well dealt with by my noble friend when he comes to wind up <e>", "<cs> that is not true <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may be further encouraged to know that the european community have made a number of <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> the resolution of the united nations commission on human rights to which i referred called for the appointment of a <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that our representations will have some effect upon the situation but i have to say that following previous experience i doubt whether they will <e>", "<cs> my lords i leave to your lordships the conclusions to be deducted from the parallel which the noble viscount draws <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that it profits us much to hark back too far in these matters but certainly the present situation is totally unsatisfactory and that is why we have made the representations that we have made <e>", "<cs> my lords under disaster relief arrangements her majestys government are providing medicines valued at and are contributing to the cost of transporting relief supplies donated by other agencies <e> <s> our share of the emergency aid provided by the european development fund totalling some is about <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right this was a very serious matter <e> <s> i hope that the damage that has been done can be put right <e> <s> as i say we are making available such assistance as we can <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly we shall look at whatever further requests may be put to us but i suspect that the best way forward for the malagasys would be through some of the multilateral agencies i have referred to including for example the european development fund <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the last part of the noble lords supplementary question is no <e> <s> as my right honourable friend has said as i have said and as my right honourable friend the foreign secretary has said the fact is <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will recall that we had a debate on that matter some months ago when i described the position there in some detail <e> <s> the fact remains that none of the nuclear weapons referred to in this country can be fired without the agreement of the british prime minister <e> <s> if that is not a veto i do not know what is <e>", "<cs> my lords the communiqu is certainly one of the documents that set out the facts in this matter but as the noble lord will also recall the circumstances of this arrangement are reviewed each time a united states president or a british prime minister comes into office <e> <s> that has been done on each of those occasions since <e> <s> incidentally the matter was additionally reviewed at the time of the decision relating to the basing of cruise missiles in this country <e>", "<cs> on the contrary my lords i believe that the communique provides proper authority for the matter to which i have referred which as i have said has in addition repeatedly been confirmed since then <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the american president confirmed that a year or so ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i assure my noble friend that my right honourable friend the prime minister does have the power to disagree <e>", "<cs> my lords the fertile imagination of noble lords opposite sometimes leaves me somewhat breathless but i can assure the noble lord that the arrangements have been examined very carefully and that the effect of the arrangements and of the undertakings we have is as i described in my original answer <e>", "<cs> my lords that if i may say so strays rather far from the matter that we have been discussing <e> <s> but the fact of the matter is that these weapons are of course part of our deterrent posture and the whole purpose of them is to ensure that nobody seeks to take anybody else out <e>", "<cs> my lords i have just given that answer to the noble lord lord cledwyn when i referred to the original communique and to the various re-examinations of that communique which have been made from time to time <e>", "<cs> my lords as i again said just now this matter was reviewed at the time of the decision for the basing of these missiles in this country <e> <s> the arrangements were found then to be satisfactory both to the united states and to the united kingdom and the effect of those understandings is as i have already said <e>", "<cs> my lords not without notice <e>", "<cs> my lords i prefer to rely upon the words of the president <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both the noble and learned lord and the noble lord <e> <s> in answer to the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones there are about british people working and living in angola <e> <s> we have had to make clear to them that we cannot be directly responsible for their safety but the decision on whether or not to remain particularly in some of the more difficult areas is a matter for them and not for us <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will know the unita organisation is not one with which the british government have any particular dealings <e> <s> our only concern in this matter was to secure the release of those who had been taken prisoner and our actions were organised only for that purpose <e> <s> it is true that some logistic and administrative support was provided to us by the south africans in respect of securing that release but i am not aware of any other role played by them <e>", "<cs> i am not sure about that my lords <e> <s> the meeting at oxford to which the noble lord referred in his question was organised i understand by a group pressing for our unilateral abolition of nuclear weapons and while i have no reason to doubt the sincerity of the participants i do not believe that its findings could be truly described as objective <e> <s> as for the sheffield meeting to which the noble lord refers we shall have to see what the outcome of that will be <e>", "<cs> my lords i do my best to allay any unnecessary anxiety that might emerge from questions put to me <e>", "<cs> my lords yes of course i wholly agree that even the most limited war nuclear or otherwise would be wholly disastrous <e> <s> all our policy therefore is aimed to securing that that does not happen <e> <s> all the same i think it is wise to try to get these things into perspective <e> <s> the eruption at krakatoa for example in the s was in many ways analgous to a massive nuclear explosion albeit on a localised scale but it only had a limited effect on the atmosphere <e> <s> the area around was plunged into darkness for two and a half days i understand and the mean temperature on earth was reduced by only about degrees centigrade for the next few years <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so there is more than one view about the conclusions of the washington conference <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord has seen the article in the march edition of <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly the case that if a nuclear war were tragically to break out then those who started it would suffer as much as those who were on the receiving end <e>", "<cs> my lords yes indeed we take cognizance of the views of all those who might have something to contribute in the discussion of these matters <e> <s> that was why i referred just now to the article in <e>", "<cs> my lords that goes to underline what i said just now that we certainly agree that the outcome of any such war would be horrific <e> <s> that is why it is our policy to see that no such war ever starts <e>", "<cs> my lords all the suggestions that are aimed at this government and at the nato alliance for measures of unilateral disarmament seem to forget if i may say so that the russians have made it clear that they will never follow any such course <e>", "<cs> my lords the western alliance is most certainly ready to continue discussions on this matter <e> <s> what a pity it is that the russians left the table in geneva <e>", "<cs> these amendments as the noble lord has said would oblige the secretary of state to consult the rating authorities and representatives of industrial and commercial ratepayers in greater <e>", "<cs> i am not for a moment resisting the idea of appropriate and proper consultation but in this case the levy as the noble lord refers to it will be a precept upon the ratepayers <e> <s> the boroughs will be acting as a collecting agency <e> <s> there will be no question of the boroughs having to distinguish between one service and another with regard to their revenue when they are considering how to collect these moneys because the amount that they will have to collect will be set by the order to which i have referred which will be considered and approved by the other place <e> <s> there are london members of parliament in the other place who will doubtless make their views known on behalf of their constituents <e> <s> they will say what they think of the proposals that are made <e> <s> it is necessary to remember that the boroughs will be acting as a collecting agency and that this will not therefore be a precept on the boroughs but on the ratepayers <e>", "<cs> yes indeed i hasten to reassure my noble friend that my right honourable friend will be very willing to listen to the representations made to him on this matter by the representatives of commerce and industry particularly i imagine through the voice of the cbi <e> <s> no one knows better than i that the cbi has excellent lines of communication with members of your lordships house and no doubt with honourable and right honourable members of another place <e> <s> i am quite sure that those views too will be represented in another place when consideration of the order comes before it <e>", "<cs> the governments starting point is that a ratepayer contribution is necessary to ensure that londons ratepayers should not be uniquely favoured compared with the rest of the country <e> <s> ratepayers elsewhere in the country will continue to support public transport in their areas and there is no good reason to treat greater london differently <e> <s> there has been a great deal of discussion before the bill reached this house about the present level of support provided by london ratepayers to london transport <e>", "<cs> however one makes the calculations and i am inspired by the example of my noble friend the chief whip at question time the fact remains that the ratepayer contribution is higher under the present arrangements than it will be when the arrangements in this bill come into force <e> <s> as i say it looks on present calculations as if next year the ratepayer contribution will be of the order of per cent <e> <s> but of course the bill now before us provides for a lower percentage than that <e> <s> i think i am content to rest upon that basic assumption <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i have to take a similar line with respect to no <e> <s> as i do with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i do not think it would enhance this bill at all <e> <s> we certainly want to keep the option open for my right honourable friend but as he has made clear in the other place he hopes very much indeed that he will not have to use it <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has presented the power to require lrt to place a surplus in reserve or <e>", "<cs> i imagine that in the circumstances that the noble lord describes i have not had an opportunity to look at the report or to consider the recent matters to which he has referred they would be carried forward to next year to cover the capital expenditure that would by then be envisaged <e> <s> the noble lord says that a surplus has been generated this year <e> <s> as i say i have not seen the figures but i doubt very much whether that surplus takes into account all the various capital charges that should properly be charged to revenue account <e>", "<cs> i wish to be clear about this <e> <s> the figure that the noble lord was talking about was the figure that i think he said had recently been announced by london transport in respect of the current year <e> <s> as i say i have not seen that report <e> <s> i think that he said that it appeared only today in the newspaper <e> <s> i very much doubt whether that operating surplus to which the noble lord referred takes into account all the items that are properly chargeable to revenue account <e> <s> if it did that would be creating a quite new situation in london transport and not one i think that has yet arrived <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend lord plummer was not in his place during our earlier discussion i fear that the noble lord lord mcintosh was not listening to the reply that i have just now given either <e> <s> the fact is that the power that the noble lord seeks to take away by the amendment is one that will be used only exceptionally as i have said and only in the circumstances of a windfall to london regional transport such as i think that this was suggested in the other place the discovery of oil in osterley or lead somewhere else <e> <s> i do not think that those eventualities are particularly likely <e> <s> it is therefore equally unlikely that my right honourable friend will want to use this power <e> <s> but it is right that the power should remain in his hands if he needs it <e>", "<cs> i should like to reassure your lordships that i understand your lordships concern that surpluses made by lrt should be retained by the business for the following year so reducing the grant they need and the size of the ratepayer contribution to be collected <e> <s> in practice this is what will usually happen <e> <s> such surpluses will normally arise because lrt have conducted their business more efficiently or because subsidy has been over-estimated and it is right that the ratepayer should benefit from that <e> <s> i am happy to underline that point <e>", "<cs> i must say that i sympathise with the general thrust of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it describes in laymans language exactly what the government seek to achieve that is to say the application so far as possible of normal commercial accounting practices to nationalised industry accounts <e> <s> regrettably we cannot achieve that through the wording of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> normal accounting practices would mean in effect the application of the companies acts to lrts accounts <e> <s> but because lrt are not a company but a statutory corporation they are not bound by the companies act <e> <s> their absence of a normal capital structure is also a major obstacle to the application of the companies acts as they stand <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just respond to one point made by the noble lord <e> <s> i am not quite sure whether the words that he proposes in amendment no <e> <s> that the accounts should be no less informative than those required by the companies acts are an appropriate form of words to include in an amendment which finds its way into a piece of legislation <e> <s> i believe that it would be very difficult to find a legally acceptable interpretation of the words no less informative <e> <s> clearly there are pieces of information required by the companies acts which companies include in their annual accounts and which auditors look at which would be wholly inappropriate for a nationalised industry corporation such as we are now creating through the medium of this legislation <e>", "<cs> it may help your lordships if very briefly i explain how the governments policy of seeking greater accountability in all fields of public expenditure squares with the removal of lrt from the aegis of the comptroller and auditor general <e> <s> there are three reasons for this <e> <s> first it is the secretary of state not lrt themselves who is accountable to parliament for lrts finances <e> <s> comptroller and auditor general investigation would blur this clear line of accountability <e> <s> secondly scrutiny would inevitably draw ministers into day-to-day management issues relating to lrt in response to questions about lrts detailed application of public funds <e>", "<cs> we should continue with amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> no the clerk says <e>", "<cs> the government have repeatedly stressed the importance which we attach to the need for close co-operation between lrt and british rail <e> <s> part i of the bill brings lrt and british rail within the same policy and financial framework <e> <s> part ii of the bill contains reserve powers to establish an even closer formal relationship between the two if that is proved necessary <e>", "<cs> it may just be that this amendment reflects a misunderstanding on the part of the noble lord <e> <s> the amendment is drafted in very wide terms to enable lrt to make agreements with any county or district council in whose area are services serving greater london and where the councils provide financial support for those services <e> <s> local authorities outside greater london already have powers to buy extra services or to top up services from british rail under section of the transport act <e> <s> these powers will continue to be available <e>", "<cs> i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> b <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that that would be the case <e> <s> as the noble baroness mentioned the british airports authority have planning permission to construct an emergency runway out of the existing northern taxiway <e> <s> work on this is expected to commence shortly <e> <s> however i would emphasise that it is proposed that it should be only an emergency runway in other words available for use only when the main runway is not for some reason available <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall happily write to the noble baroness if i need to do so but i hope that i can satisfy her on this point <e> <s> the case is that the northern taxiway when it is upgraded as i have said will not be of the same length as the main runway <e> <s> therefore it will not be able to take fully loaded long-range transport aircraft <e> <s> however it will be available to ensure that the worst difficulties caused by the closure of the main runway for example that aircraft cannot leave gatwick at all or cannot land even in an emergency do not arise <e>", "<cs> my lords the first part of the noble baronesss supplementary question is hypothetical <e> <s> as the government have said on a number of occasions they do not propose to build a second runway at gatwick <e> <s> as to the second part of the noble baronesss supplementary question the case is that the undertakings given by the british airports authority will be transferred to whoever in the future may turn out to be the owner of gatwick airport <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord believes that that might reduce the number of operations into heathrow but i have to tell him that the evidence which i have does not support that contention <e> <s> the way in which the total number of movements at heathrow is to be controlled will be in accordance with the planning consent that was given for the fourth terminal at heathrow which as the noble lord may recall imposes a total maximum limit upon the number of movements at heathrow <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier it will not be so long as the main runway at gatwick <e> <s> therefore it will not be available for use by the most heavily laden of the large aircraft nor i understand will it have the kind of radio navigation aids which are normally available on the main runway <e> <s> this means that it will not be possible to use the emergency runway in adverse weather conditions in the same way as the main runway can usually be used <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord may know the physical standards of the runway are defined in terms of load classification number <e> <s> when it is upgraded to be an emergency runway i believe that the maximum load classification number of the new taxiway will not be the same as the classification of the main runway at gatwick which again means that the most heavily laden aeroplanes will not be able to use it <e>", "<cs> my lords that sounds to me to be a purely hypothetical question but if my noble friend has any specific case in mind i will be happy to examine it <e>", "<cs> my lords if the emergency considerations were overiding and the view of the captain of the aircraft was such that only that runway was suitable to cope with the particular emergency that had arisen then of course permission would be given for it to be used <e> <s> generally speaking what would happen in such a circumstance would be that the arriving aircraft for example would divert to some other aerodrome <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend that the committee which first considers these matters is very well aware of the considerations which <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend to the extent that the traditional names will always be very much in the forefront of consideration when we select new names for new ships <e> <s> however i cannot assure my noble friend i am afraid that all the names he has in mind will necessarily be continued for ever <e>", "<cs> my lords the consideration that i have referred to is a continuous process <e> <s> the committee which considers these matters is a standing committee <e> <s> that committee brings forward its recommendations to the admiralty board and in the case of large ships her majesty the queen has subsequently to be consulted <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend that all these considerations will most certainly be taken into account and above all of course my noble friends own association <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a feeling that there is a trap in that supplementary question somewhere <e> <s> however i also imagine that the royal navy will want to hold on to the present arrangements in these matters for a long time <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in the original answer the planning consent to which i referred did not provide for the taxiway to be developed for use as a full runway as the noble lord is asking <e> <s> indeed i think that there would be considerable physical difficulties in doing that because as the noble lord will recall the taxiway is quite close to the existing main runway and in any event there are certain topographical difficulties in the area which i think would prevent a full runway being constructed for the purpose that the noble lord has in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of whether or not a single runway can accommodate million passengers is one about which some of your lordships have asked me on a number of occasions <e> <s> the government remain of the view that the single runway will be able to handle million passengers a year by the time we reach the mid-s because we expect that by then the average load of the aircraft using the runway will have significantly increased <e> <s> so we remain of the view that our estimates in that particular area are appropriate <e> <s> we also remain of the view that a second runway would cause very considerable <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that the emergency runway which is now being constructed will not be available for use in the most adverse conditions <e> <s> if the noble baroness would like me to go into detail on that point perhaps it would be appropriate for me to write to her on it <e> <s> however the runway will be equipped with a range of lights so that it will be possible to use it at night provided that the weather is not particularly adverse <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the emergency runway will come into use automatically if for any reason the main runway is not available <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a question of not only the size of the aeroplane being used but also the load factor and how many seats of a particular aeroplane are occupied <e> <s> i should not wish to bore the house or the noble lord with the detailed arithmetic involved but perhaps i may write to the noble lord with the particulars of the arithmetic <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord says there are a number of accounting techniques which can be applied to these considerations but they have to take into account and make a number of assumptions which may or may not be valid in five or years time <e> <s> therefore i am not sure whether a broad brush calculation made now no doubt it could be made would be helpful to either the noble lord or the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear what the noble baroness says but i must say that when i made those remarks i heard some appreciative groans from behind me <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord suggests that is a matter for the usual channels <e> <s> i normally undertake to write a letter in that way when i imagine that the information is of interest only to a particular noble lord or noble baroness <e> <s> but if for example the noble lord would like me to give the information in answer to a question for written answer i should be very happy to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether that is the normal procedure but if that is the wish of the house and of those who are to receive the letter i should be very happy to do it <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said to the noble lord lord bruce it may be possible to produce some figures of that kind but i am not sure whether they would be very reliable ones <e> <s> the noble baroness may <e>", "<cs> my lords the review currently being undertaken by the civil aviation authority is a thorough study of the implications of privatising british airways for competition and the sound development of the british airline industry <e> <s> the government expect changes if any in air transport licensing policy arising out of the review to be decided well in advance of privatisation and there should therefore be no need to delay it on that account <e>", "<cs> my lords the investing public will of course have a full opportunity to consider the merits of the proposals that are put before them when the documents are issued in due course <e> <s> it is of course important that potential investors are aware of the sort of competitive environment in which british airways will be operating <e> <s> that will be made clear to them at the same time <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of debate on these matters would not be one for me <e> <s> i feel sure however that what the noble lord says will be heard by the usual channels who sit in your lordships house <e> <s> it is perhaps worth saying that the proposal to privatise british airways is one that has been well known to your lordships for a long time <e> <s> indeed it was i who had the honour some two years ago of <e>", "<cs> my lords comfortably <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend will not be surprised to hear that i agree with the assertion that he makes <e> <s> i believe that the privatisation of british airways would be very much in the interests both of the staff and of the company itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that now is the occasion to consider again the merits of privatisation of british airways <e> <s> they have been discussed at great length in your lordships house not least during the passage of the bill to which i have referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i have not got that figure in my head <e> <s> but is fair to say i think that a large number of major world airlines are not in public hands <e>", "<cs> my lords the staff of british airways have of course been kept fully informed of the governments plans as they have developed <e> <s> it is perhaps worth adding that they will be given a chance to participate in the privatisation when the time comes <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i think that the important factor to remember is that in recent months and years british airways has remarkably improved its position as a major airline <e> <s> i think that when the time comes to offer shares to the public there will be a warm welcome for them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has <e> <s> i think misunderstood my earlier remark <e> <s> the arrangements for the staff to which i referred will be advantageous not just the ordinary ability to buy shares on the open market <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord underestimates the very remarkable improvement that has occurred in the fortunes of british airways as a result not only of the efforts of previous members of the staff but particularly of the new chairman my noble friend lord king <e>", "<cs> my lords again i have not got comparative figures at my fingertips <e> <s> but the improvement that british airways has achieved in recent years as i have already said has been quite remarkable <e> <s> off the top of my head i would think that it has outstripped a good many other airlines <e>", "<cs> my lords as my right honourable friend the secretary of state for defence made clear in another place on th may the understandings between the two governments are of course reaffirmed by letter <e> <s> let me add in the light of the second part of the noble lords supplementary that the united states administration has confirmed to us that the presidents understanding of the arrangements is entirely consistent with that of the prime minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to say that we have been unable to confirm that the words reportedly said by general meyer were in fact said at all <e> <s> the united states administration has made it absolutely clear that there is no question of the united states president relinquishing his authority over any us nuclear weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only repeat that the united states administration has confirmed to us that the presidents understanding of the arrangements is entirely consistent with that of the prime minister <e> <s> as i said earlier the detailed communications between the two governments on this matter are of course confidential and cannot therefore be revealed <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that the effect of the understandings is as described by my right honourable friend in the other place on th may last year and i am content to rest on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the communiqu by which time of course sir winston churchill was prime minister was indeed published <e> <s> the understandings that were set out then have been reaffirmed every time a new president or a new prime minister comes into office and that of course includes prime ministers of the administrations of the party opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a feeling that the noble lord is attempting to steer the question on to a different topic altogether <e> <s> but i can confirm again that the united states administration has confirmed to us that the presidents understanding of the arrangements is entirely consistent with that of the prime minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be happy to look at the document to which the noble lord refers and write to him if i have anything to add <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can go further than to say that the understandings have been reviewed every time a new prime minister or a new president comes into office <e> <s> it has been found satisfactory on every occasion and i do not think there is more that i can do to assist your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the noble lords fears that clause without the protection of the amendment would permit lrt to dispose of assets too cheaply with a resulting loss to the public purse <e> <s> critics of this part of the bill although the noble lord did not use these words today have described it in terms of asset-stripping for the benefit of lrts competitors and have talked of hidden subsidies to the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been agreed through the usual channels that we should discontinue consideration of this bill now <e> <s> i therefore beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned and that we should not return to this bill until ten minutes past eight <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords rising as i do to the deafening silence from behind me may i say that as i explained to your lordships during our discussion of an identical amendment at committee stage the governments starting point is that the ratepayer contribution is necessary to ensure that londons ratepayers should not be differently treated from those in the rest of the country <e> <s> ratepayers elsewhere will continue to subsidise their local transport and there is no good reason why they should not continue to do so in london <e>", "<cs> my lords i recall in our earlier debates that noble lords opposite were strongly opposed to the idea of a levy on rating authorities in greater london towards the cost of lrt <e> <s> but they are now asking that we extend the concept to non-london ratepayers as well <e> <s> having said that i understand why this amendment has been tabled <e> <s> as the noble lord lord underhill has said it is to ensure that the ratepayers in the home counties will pay towards lrt services in their area just as ratepayers will do within greater london <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will not be surprised to hear that we support that view in principle but we see no need to amend the machinery of the ratepayers levy to achieve that end <e>", "<cs> my lords although i understand the noble lords point in moving this amendment i am afraid that the amendment is founded on a misconception <e> <s> the assumption is that there will be gross charges to the capital account which will be offset by the proceeds of any disposal of assets to contractors <e> <s> i have to remind your lordships that lrt themselves will not have a conventional capital structure <e> <s> there will be no shares in lrt they will not have any commencing capital debt which generates an interest charge and their only capital costs will arise where they borrow for a profitable investment <e> <s> but in such circumstances the investment should pay for itself and should not benefit from a cross-subsidy from the sales of other assets <e> <s> therefore there are no gross charges to capital account to be offset <e> <s> indeed there will be no capital account in the usual commercial sense of the term <e> <s> i should also like to return to the point which i made when we discussed amendment no <e> <s> on clause <e> <s> we do not envisage that they will normally wish to sell assets to private operators in connection with clause agreements <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey said we discussed identical amendments at committee stage <e> <s> before i turn to the substance of the amendments it may be helpful if i repeat briefly the description which i gave of the arrangements for auditing lrts accounts in the future <e> <s> the basic system is set out in the early part of this clause <e> <s> lrts auditors will undertake annually an audit of lrts books <e> <s> this audit will follow standard and up-to-date accounting practice <e> <s> the auditors will examine samples of lrts records look at the accuracy of their documents and investigate lrts cost and cash control system to see how far they secure value for money <e> <s> we like any commercial sponsors place great weight on these procedures and i should like to emphasise them to your lordships <e> <s> modern accountancy is much more than just a matter of adding up figures <e> <s> these days it goes a long way to embrace the type of special audit that the glc have just commissioned <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i understand it has been agreed that we should go no further this evening <e> <s> accordingly i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend that we take steps to ensure that all the commercially available products are properly evaluated <e> <s> but the combat high hoot to which my noble friends question refers has been tested not least in the falkland islands in and has been found to be very satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i shall need to study that question rather carefully <e> <s> but the fact of the matter is that it is almost impossible and in fact it is undesirable to make a totally waterproof boot because i am told that it is necessary for the feet to breathe <e> <s> that means that it is not possible to construct the boot of rubber for example or of some other totally waterproof material <e> <s> as i have said this boot has been tried extensively and has proved to be very successful <e> <s> as far as costs are concerned i believe that the combat high boot costs us about a pair <e>", "<cs> no my lords comfort is a matter of paramount importance and it is of course represented to us very strongly by those who have to wear the boots <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm to my noble friend that we have lost no opportunity to represent this point to the spaniards <e> <s> but i should like to add that in the event of the safety of the aircraft becoming a consideration pilots operating into gibraltar are directed to enter the prohibited area if need be <e>", "<cs> my lords we hope to be in a position to decide later this year whether to purchase aircraft to replace the royal air forces basic trainer fleet of jet provosts and if so which of the four short-listed contenders should be selected <e> <s> if we do decide on replacement we shall of course take full account of the broader economic and industrial considerations in assessing all the contenders that meet the specification <e> <s> i should add that the firecracker is not in fact an all-british aircraft but contains a significant number of foreign components <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure my noble friend is right in saying that this order would be important to the british company first of all with regard to the royal air force order if it comes and secondly with regard to any possible export orders which may flow from it <e> <s> although as my noble friend acknowledges the engines of all the contenders for this particular contract are in fact of non-british design and indeed of non-british manufacture it is the case that rather more than just the engine and the propeller are of foreign manufacture <e> <s> in fact in regard to the firecracker no less than per cent <e> <s> of the equipment in terms of cost is of non-uk origin <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not certain about that because the company concerned does not in fact have any manufacturing facilities of its own and would need to make some arrangement with an existing manufacturer <e> <s> so it might not therefore mean immediate new jobs <e> <s> we have also made clear that even if we were to choose one of the other designs not of united kingdom origin we would expect that that too would be manufactured under licence in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all the design of that aeroplane to which my noble friend refers is of course an australian design <e> <s> i understand that that particular aircraft has not yet flown even in prototype form but of course it would be manufactured as my noble friend says by a british company <e> <s> indeed we anticipate that that would be the case whichever one we chose <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that the industrial considerations will be important ones but it will be important too to ensure that the chosen aircraft meets the specification that we require and that the price and delivery terms offered are in accordance with the requirements that we have set out <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i should be drawn down the hypothetical route which the noble lord suggests but on the first part of the noble lords supplementary question we have not yet set the precise specification that we shall require <e> <s> we have issued as i think the noble lord will know an air staff target <e> <s> the air staff requirement is now being prepared following the general submissions that we have received from the manufacturers and the air staff requirement will in due course be issued with a view to tenders being sought <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot yet say that the development of the jet provost has finally been abandoned as an idea <e> <s> that will depend on the results of the tendering exercise that we shall be embarking upon shortly <e> <s> but i think it would be fair to say that that is becoming less and less likely <e>", "<cs> my lords it will i hope be for me to fly them all <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords who have spoken today first i should like to congratulate the noble and gallant lord lord cameron on initiating our discussion this evening <e> <s> indeed this debate must be unique in the wealth of knowledge and experience that has been drawn upon in the course of discussion <e> <s> there can be few occasions when four former chiefs of the defence staff a former secretary of state for defence and a former secretary to the cabinet all speak during a short debate not to mention three former defence ministers and yes one parliamentary under-secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly cull the pages of <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the first of the noble baronesss supplementary questions goes i understand that the council of the icao have been somewhat pre-occupied lately not least with the korean airliner disaster and it is therefore not yet possible to be precise as to when they will be able to consider these matters but we hope that they may have an opportunity to do so later this year <e> <s> with regard to the noble baronesss second supplementary the new routes to which i have referred have been available for only a week or two <e> <s> therefore i am afraid that it is not yet possible to give any indication of the economies that have been effected <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure it will be <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will know nobody is more concerned to safeguard the interests of general aviation users than i am <e> <s> as the noble lord will be aware it has always been the policy to ensure that there is a band of airspace below the controlled airspace to which i have referred kept available for general aviation and smaller aircraft <e> <s> that is certainly the case in this instance <e>", "<cs> my lords the present strength of the royal naval reserve including the womens royal naval reserve and the queen alexandras royal naval nursing service reserve is <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend that we are considering this matter <e> <s> we are looking particularly at what the rnrs role might be during wartime and when we have finished our consideration of this aspect we shall see to it that the appropriate numbers and equipment are provided <e>", "<cs> my lords if the soviet union want to secure reductions in nuclear weapons then all they have to do is return to the negotiating table in geneva which they left so abruptly <e> <s> may i add in regard to the earlier part of the noble lords supplementary question that perhaps it would be a good first step on the part of the signatories concerned to try to ensure that those who have not yet signed the nonproliferation treaty do so <e> <s> for example india and tanzania have not yet found it possible to sign the treaty and in our view it would be extremely helpful if they could do so <e> <s> as to the reception that will be given to the delegation to which the noble lord referred i can certainly give him an assurance that it will be received at an appropriate level <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the best assistance that the western powers can offer in that regard is to repeat the assurance that has been given publicly that they are willing to resume those talks without any pre-conditions whatsoever <e>", "<cs> my lords the trouble with a freeze is that it would perpetuate some important imbalances between east and west in favour of the soviet union <e> <s> it would also remove the incentive for the russians to return to the negotiating table in order to reach agreements on major reductions in nuclear armaments <e>", "<cs> my lords the views of our allies in this matter are very close to those of ourselves <e> <s> a freeze as i say would perpetuate some important imbalances between east and west <e> <s> that is the reason we cannot accept that proposal but we are ready to return to the negotiating table and it remains only for the soviet union to signify their willingness too <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall certainly play our role in the talks to which the noble lord has referred which are of course continuing <e> <s> it certainly would be helpful in our view for the soviet union to return to the negotiating table for the inf discussions which they broke off and indeed for the start talks too <e>", "<cs> my lords during our debate today your lordships have rightly referred to the long and distinguished history of the rofs the quality of their products and the loyalty integrity and dedication of the rof work force <e> <s> we are all on common ground in paying such a tribute to the rofs past <e> <s> but the best practical tribute is to look to the future and to seek the best way forward <e> <s> defence procurement strategy is necessarily evolving as economic circumstances change <e> <s> a review of the structure and role of this vital part of the defence industry is both timely and necessary if we are to get the best value for money in defence <e>", "<cs> my lords it simply is not proven that for the ministry of defence or any other armed forces organisation to be able to get their supplies those supplies have to come from some organisation in the public sector <e> <s> as several noble lords have already pointed out i think that per cent <e> <s> of ministry of defence supplies already come from the private sector <e> <s> other armed forces around the world obtain per cent <e> <s> of their supplies from the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the chance to respond to the noble lord lord kennets question for recent developments in lebanon especially the formation of a new government of national unity hold out some prospect at last of movement towards restoring peace in that unhappy country <e> <s> it is right therefore that we should review at this point what we and others in the west sympathetic to lebanon and to the plight of the long-suffering lebanese people can do to help the new government in the daunting tasks which they face <e> <s> i should like to review briefly some aspects of the conflict in lebanon and of our policy in this area and then look to the future and comment on what lebanons friends might be able to do to help <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend will perhaps have heard the recent announcement in connection with services between the united kingdom and the netherlands which is a first step in that direction <e> <s> as for a wider reduction in fares in europe that is something we should very much favour but it depends upon agreements being reached between the governments concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that it is true that a monopoly will be created by the privatisation of british airways because of course there is always competition not only among british carriers on a particular route but between british carriers and other national carriers <e> <s> the noble lord was quite right when he implied in the earlier part of his supplementary question that very few of the bilateral agreements permit the operation of more than one british carrier on routes to europe <e> <s> however <e>", "<cs> my lords the deliberations in the council of ministers are not normally revealed in detail but going on past form i would not be surprised if a good many of the proposals which do not see the light of day become known at least to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been no shortage of initiatives from the government in this matter starting when this government came to power and not least during the time when i had some responsibility for these matters in <e> <s> but the noble lord is quite right to imply that progress in these matters has been lamentably slow <e> <s> the government very much regret that and are doing all that they can to speed things up <e>", "<cs> my lords there are of course important considerations such as those to which my noble friend has referred which need to be taken into account in making decisions of this kind and i can assure my noble friend that they will be <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am aware of the point which my noble friend makes <e> <s> and that too will be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i hear what the noble lord says <e> <s> these too are important considerations <e> <s> the noble lord said that he had visited this establishment <e> <s> i too hope to have the chance to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall certainly want to take into account the kind of views expressed by my noble friend <e> <s> however perhaps it is worth pointing out that although the regimental headquarters as has been said is presently in ballymena the units of the regiment are deployed elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords the review to which the noble lord refers is principally concerned with training matters and a version of the report is available in the library of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am of course aware of the recruiting implications of my noble friends question and that is why i replied as i did <e>", "<cs> my lords decisions in relation to this matter will be announced in due course <e> <s> however perhaps i ought to say that the context in which the report which has been referred to has been prepared has been one in which the size of the british army has contracted quite considerably over recent years <e> <s> it was therefore appropriate to look at the size of the armys training machine including the establishment that has been referred to in this question <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin by echoing those noble lords who have thanked my noble friend lord peyton of yeovil for introducing this debate this afternoon <e> <s> as a number of noble lords have pointed out the united kingdom civil aviation industry is a key part of our national economy <e> <s> our major airlines produce annual operating revenues in excess of million <e> <s> they employ over employees in addition to all the indirect employment at airports and so on and there is the revenue earned from all these associated activities <e> <s> there is also the important contribution made by the smaller air taxi firms and all the other general aviation operators <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble baroness is yes they will but then british carriers will have reciprocal rights through the netherlands <e> <s> i think the advantage will be at least as much in the british favour as it may be <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i attach the greatest weight to the views of my noble friend but as my other noble friend lord boyd-carpenter was kind enough to say during his remarks i did at one time have some responsibility for matters of this kind with one of the smaller british airlines and i can tell your lordships that that airline is one of those which i understand will be involved in these arrangements and i am certain that they will find them very much to their favour <e> <s> i understand that british airlines are broadly pleased with what has been agreed <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of controlling the number of movements at heathrow which i think lies at the very heart of what my noble friend is <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> it is not yet possible to say precisely what share of this project will fall to the united kingdom but it will certainly be a very important share and i am clear that the project is a very important one for british aerospace <e> <s> as for the total costs of the project <e> <s> the government are not yet in a position to give their own figures on this matter <e> <s> but i understand that the industries concerned estimate that the total cost of the project up to the production stage would be about billion ecus and that thereafter the aircraft would cost between million and million ecus each <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are certainly taking into consideration the employment implications of this matter which is why i said that the project would be a very important one for british aerospace <e> <s> as for the timing of future consideration of this project i understand that a meeting has been tentatively set for th july to take place in madrid <e> <s> if that meeting goes ahead we very much hope that important decisions will be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords when a project involves no fewer than five european nations as this one does i suggest that it is better to use the european unit of account and it is that to which i was referring <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to receive those figures from the noble lord but if they continue to be valid in five or ten years time when the project gets under way that may be a different matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly be willing to explain these figures to my noble friend in the form in which he suggests as soon as the estimates are available <e>", "<cs> my lords present estimates are indeed encouraging <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to my noble friend for not referring to this because i think that he put that question to me earlier <e> <s> the engine to be fitted to this aeroplane has not yet been finally decided but <e>", "<cs> i know the noble lord has some anxieties on this matter <e> <s> i was going to draw his attention to one of the three codes which have already been published in draft i do not think the noble lord has given full weight to that fact and that is the code of practice for the searching of premises and seizure of property which is another matter to which he referred later in his remarks <e> <s> but our amendment does indeed <e>", "<cs> i hear what the noble lord says <e> <s> nonetheless it is the case that suspects are not required to give this information but i will take note of the observation of the noble lord that perhaps that fact may not be immediately known to those who are stopped under these provisions <e>", "<cs> these are just the sort of matters that will be covered by the code of practice to which i have referred and which will be brought before your lordships in due course <e> <s> but i should have thought that it was fairly obvious that a suspect who was detained in this way would then be searched and only following the search would the constable decide what was the right way to proceed thereafter <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the purpose of this provision is of course to give the police constable the power to detain and to search which is exactly the issue that we are discussing at this moment <e>", "<cs> i of course was replying to the amendment as i saw it on the marshalled list but i do believe there is a misapprehension in the mind of the noble lord and i confess that it may be that i have not sufficiently clearly explained the difficulties or rather the misapprehension in the mind of the noble lord on this matter <e> <s> i do firmly believe for example that it really is inconceivable to construct a power of search which does not include a power to detain since nobody can search a person or a vehicle for that matter without stopping it first <e> <s> guidance about searching therefore has to include guidance about detaining in the first instance in other words i believe that amendment no <e> <s> which we are discussing now does confer adequate powers to meet the anxieties of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> order <e>", "<cs> my lords the structure of the band service in the royal marines has undergone a large number of changes in this century at least and indeed in previous centuries <e> <s> i am not sure that it is necessarily accurate to say that a particular band today is directly descended from some other band of years past <e> <s> it is possible to suggest for example that the band of commando forces was called something quite different not too long ago <e> <s> there was a band called the plymouth group band which i understand played at the investiture of his royal highness the prince of wales some years ago and that has been called by some a descendant of the band of commando forces <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i agree with the noble lord that the role to which he refers is an important one and one which we have had very much in mind in reaching this decision <e> <s> there will continue to be at least three bands available in the west country one of which the band of the flag officer plymouth will be in plymouth <e> <s> in addition to that there will be the band of the britannia royal naval college at dartmouth and the band of the commando training centre at lympstone all of which will be able to perform the role to which the noble lord has referred together with the other bands which are remaining <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i need precisely answer that amusing if irrelevant supplementary but i can tell the noble lord that the total cost of the royal marines band service is of the order of million and the band of commando forces to which my noble friend referred costs about <e>", "<cs> naturally my lords i would prefer it if we could retain large numbers of bands including the very distinguished bands to which i have referred but the fact is that the defence budget is a finite budget <e> <s> it is absolutely necessary <e> <s> i believe to ensure that we get the best value for money out of that budget and that we ensure that the maximum proportion of the resources that we make available is devoted to the front line rather than to the support lines of which these bands form a part <e>", "<cs> my lords the army band service is under the same close scrutiny as that which the royal marines band service has been under <e> <s> if my noble friend would like me to write to him with details i shall be happy to do that <e> <s> we are not specifically replacing bands which are being disbanded if that is the right word by other bands but just now i gave a list of bands which are to be retained any one of which on a particular day could replace the services provided by one of the others <e> <s> i should perhaps add that although the bands have in many cases discrete names they are not necessarily individual bands with individual members because musicians very often play in more than one band in any particular period of time <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i can confirm that we have decided there should be a single defence school of music covering the musical training of all three services <e> <s> we are at present considering where this should be <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise that these are difficult decisions and a number of emotional considerations very often come into play in these matters <e> <s> but in the end we have to take account of the very considerable costs these bands represent <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that the total cost of the bands i have referred to is a comparatively small part of the defence budget as a whole <e> <s> on the other hand i am persuaded that the defence budget as a whole is best contained by having regard to all the small elements that go to make up the larger whole <e> <s> that is why we have had to have regard to the cost in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an interesting suggestion from the noble lord opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope i can dispel the fears of the noble lord that there will be any significant reduction in the ceremonial activities of the royal marines bands service <e> <s> we have been careful to do what we can to ensure that that should not take place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord for that intervention <e> <s> i shall do my best to ensure that musicians are not called upon to play in two bands at the same moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly want to take note of the views expressed by your lordships during the course of this exchange <e> <s> my noble friend and i am not sure if this was in the mind of the noble lord as well has referred to the funds and fees that these bands can earn <e> <s> but i should say that the great majority of the fees earned by royal marines hands at private engagements are paid to the musicians themselves <e> <s> indeed only about of the fees earned last year went to the ministry of defence <e>", "<cs> i hear what the noble lord says <e> <s> at this moment i do not think i can go further than my noble friend did when he replied to my noble friends earlier consideration of this point <e> <s> perhaps he will allow me to study what he has said and see if there is anything further i can tell him <e>", "<cs> as drafted subsections and require the police to provide within a reasonable time of a request to do so a record of property which they have seized <e> <s> these amendments seek to require the police to provide such a record irrespective of whether or not it is wanted and to impose a time limit of days within which such a record must be supplied <e> <s> i must confess that i do not see why the police should be required to provide a record which it may be nobody wants <e> <s> of course in any event for police purposes they will make a record of property seized and paragraph of the draft code of practice for the searching of premises will formally require them to do so <e> <s> so a record will exist irrespective of whether the person from whom the property was taken wants one <e> <s> if he does want one and that is surely right <e> <s> if for whatever reason he does not want a record i do not see what useful purpose is served by nevertheless requiring the police to provide such a record <e>", "<cs> i have explained two of the difficulties which i see <e> <s> first of all the record that the noble lord is requiring which he refers to as good housekeeping will be kept <e> <s> the code of practice requires that that should be so <e> <s> secondly that can be made available if so requested by the person concerned <e> <s> but the further difficulty is that the noble lord has set a limit of days and that imposes serious difficulties in the sort of case i have described for example where thousands and thousands of documents might have been seized and it might be very difficult indeed impossible perhaps to prepare within the -day period that the noble lord has stipulated in his amendment the sort of record he <e>", "<cs> i must confess that i have heard of particular cases where literally thousands and thousands of documents have been seized <e> <s> certainly i envisage that the police would wish to list those documents <e> <s> i must maintain my position that that might be very difficult within the -day period that the noble lord has stipulated <e>", "<cs> that is all very well but what i am being asked to agree to is a proposition which from the point of view of the police is wholly unreasonable <e> <s> how can it be the case and this is what the noble lord lord hutchinson is asking me to accept that the police having seized a large quantity of documents which the noble lord on his own admission has said might take as long as two years to examine <e>", "<cs> how can it be the case that as regards a large quantity of documents which must clearly take many months to examine i put it no higher than that the police should be required to give an accurate list of what has been taken within days which is exactly the effect of one of the amendments which we are now considering <e> <s> i ask your lordships to accept that the best way is to adopt the provisions provided in the bill which give the police a reasonable time in which to conduct their examination of the documents to prepare a list and to provide it to the person from whom the documents or other items have <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has now departed somewhat from what he was originally proposing and i acknowledge his flexibility in doing that <e> <s> however i am not now clear how what he now proposes differs from what we already have in the bill <e> <s> but maybe i could take the matter away and study what the noble lord has said and if it is thought fit perhaps return to the matter at another stage <e>", "<cs> i grovel before your lordships because of this inadvertent slip <e> <s> i am happy to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> i hear what the noble lord says <e> <s> i am not exactly certain what additional guidance could be prepared that would meet the noble lords anxieties but perhaps he would allow me to consider that point too and see whether we can come up with something to include in the code of practice <e>", "<cs> subsection of this clause permits the retention of seized articles for as long as is necesary in all the circumstances <e> <s> subsection then refers in particular to articles which might be needed for the purposes of evidence at a trial for an offence or for forensic or other investigation or if they are reasonably believed to have been obtained as a result <e>", "<cs> clause defines what is meant by an arrestable offence and delineates the powers of arrest that attach to such offences <e> <s> however the fact that arrestable offences carry with them certain arrest powers is only one of the distinguishing features of this category of offences <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord would allow me to make one intervention before he withdraws his amendment as i think he intends to <e> <s> i apologise for i omitted to make one important observation when i was speaking just now <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for raising this point <e> <s> i agree with him that there does appear to be a case for placing the existing common law regarding what should happen following a citizens arrest on a statutory basis <e> <s> given all the protections that we have provided in the case of police powers it does seem strange to rely upon the common law in the case of a citizens power <e> <s> but we must be careful <e> <s> there may be very good reasons why a person arrested in this way should not be handed over to the police <e> <s> it may be an instance of an officious store detective whose decision to arrest would be immediately countermanded by a more senior member of staff <e> <s> it may be a case of simple mistake either of identity or about the supposed criminal act where all concerned realise within a very few minutes that they have arrested in error and so on <e>", "<cs> i believe i can go a little way to reassuring the noble and learned lord lord denning and the noble lord lord foot and perhaps also my noble friend lord renton <e> <s> the pages full of powers of arrest in the red book which the noble and learned lord showed to us are all in fact repealed by clause of this bill in favour of a general arrest power in clause <e>", "<cs> i apologise if i skated rather lightly over this amendment in the interests of speed when i moved it <e> <s> a moment ago <e> <s> but the purpose of the amendment is to make it clear that clause is only concerned with non-arrestable offences <e> <s> clause bestows adequate powers of arrest to deal with arrestable offences and this clause need not apply to them <e> <s> it is for that reason that i ask your lordships to agree to it <e>", "<cs> i am happy to discuss these amendments together if that would be the wish of your lordships <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for his support for the line with which i hope to persuade your lordships <e> <s> the amendment moved by the noble lord lord hutchinson and supported by the noble lord lord hooson would limit the power of arrest under this clause as the noble lord said to offences which are punishable by imprisonment <e> <s> it is perhaps ironic that it is precisely these offences which the royal commission recommended should be arrestable offences and so subject to the greater arrest powers contained in clause that is in paragraph of the report <e> <s> i appreciate the concern expressed by the noble lord lord hooson and i think the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington wishes to put further points to your lordships i believe that it would be appropriate for him to do so before the question is put <e>", "<cs> i cannot claim that we have adopted every word and syllable of the royal commissions proposals but we have gone a little way along the line which they suggested in the manner i mentioned earlier <e>", "<cs> subsection <e>", "<cs> i imagined that the noble baroness lady ewan-biggs might want to intervene on this point because it occurs to me that we might group together rather more amendments than did the noble lord at the outset <e>", "<cs> i am happy to proceed in that way if i may first extract my notes from the single speech that i had prepared for this occasion <e> <s> before i deal on a later occasion with the amendments of the noble baroness let me say a word about the fingerprinting amendments which i think were uppermost in the minds of noble lords <e> <s> national police records of convictions are maintained on behalf of all police forces by the national identification bureau at new <e>", "<cs> if i may just return to what i think is the amendment to which the noble lord has drawn my attention that is amendment no <e> <s> d page line at end insert <e>", "<cs> to be frank i am afraid i am not able to unscramble my remarks in the way the noble lord requests but the noble lord will not be surprised to hear that although i am not for the moment able to provide him with the most cogent arguments the fact is that the government are not able to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> in the hope that i have now the right words to put before your lordships may i confirm that these amendments would limit the power of arrest conferred by clause to persons over the age of <e> <s> but as i have explained it is necessary for the records maintained by the national identification bureau to contain the fingerprints of all people with convictions for recordable offences whatever their age <e> <s> it follows that it is therefore necesary that the reserve powers of arrest conferred by the clause should apply to all such persons <e>", "<cs> i am aware that two ages have been mentioned <e> <s> i believe there has been some confusion over that point in the printing of this particular amendment <e> <s> if it is that the noble baroness has in mind i am happy to be corrected <e>", "<cs> i hear what the noble lord says but i do have to say that i think we are dealing here not only with the per cent <e> <s> to which the noble lord referred but as effectively as we can with the per cent <e> <s> too not only in the interests of maintaining <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has made a good point <e> <s> perhaps i can consider whether the prisoner should be notified at the stage of the court hearing or in some other way and come back to the noble lord at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i believe that generally speaking fingerprints will be taken at the time that the noble lord suggests but we have to make provision for the situation in which an offender may disappear from the court before the police can speak to him <e> <s> once he has left the dock i am told that the police have no power to detain him unless a specific power is provided which enables them to do so <e> <s> we are talking about a situation in which a man has left the court and has declined to accept the invitation to have his fingerprints taken <e> <s> therefore the power to arrest him is provided <e> <s> i do not believe that having ones fingerprints taken is quite so awful as the noble lord suggests <e> <s> i have had my fingerprints taken and i am told that my noble friend lord elton has had his fingerprints taken too <e> <s> it is neither painful nor inconvenient <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge has provided my noble friend with the answer to his second question <e> <s> we are referring to the taking of fingerprints after a conviction has been achieved <e> <s> as i said just now the moment that a case has been disposed of the police have no further powers of detention so far as the prisoner is concerned <e> <s> he can then leave the dock and if he is not given a custodial sentence then away he goes <e> <s> he might choose to leave very quickly and i should not blame him <e> <s> in general the police will try to ensure that the fingerprints are taken before a prisoner leaves the precincts of the court but on the few occasions where that is not possible because the man has left too quickly the police should be entitled to ask him to come back and have his fingerprints taken <e> <s> if he refuses to do that he should be able to be arrested as i have already said <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that magistrates have the power to do that but perhaps i can make further inquiries and if i am wrong let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> taking fingerprints is one thing but one has actually got to get hold of the chap first and that is what we are talking about <e>", "<cs> in order to assist the noble lord lord hutchinson and myself for that matter perhaps i may add that clause applies only at a police station and not at a magistrates court <e> <s> we are therefore left with the position where someone convicted of an offence may seek to leave a magistrates court quite legitimately immediately following the conclusion of the proceedings in his case <e> <s> it is that kind of circumstance which we seek to encompass by this measure <e>", "<cs> knocking on the door is of course avoided if the person concerned responds to the invitation to return to have his fingerprints taken <e>", "<cs> my reading of clause relating to the taking of fingerprints at a police station is where it says in subsection <e>", "<cs> i have to confess that my interpretation of clause has been less crisp than it should have been and perhaps i could therefore be permitted to consider this matter further and come back to it at another stage <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord lord airedale would allow me to reply because i am actually proposing to say that i very much accept the spirit of these amendments and i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for drawing this matter to our attention <e> <s> we agree that a person should not be liable to summary arrest if he refuses perhaps for a very good reason such as a prior appointment to go to police station at once provided that he attends within a reasonable period thereafter <e> <s> in practice i am confident that the police would not apply the clause so inflexibly and would be able to come to a reasonable agreement with reasonably reliable people <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly see that the noble lords point is taken into account <e>", "<cs> i do not dissent at all from the spirit of this amendment which is that if a convicted person has to be arrested to have his fingerprints taken this interference with his liberty should be kept to the absolute minimum <e> <s> i hope to persuade your lordships however both that no amendment to the bill is necessary and that this particular amendment might on occasion simply prove impracticable <e>", "<cs> i have not gone so far as the noble lord suggests <e> <s> i gave certain assurances to the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones which did not encompass the whole provision <e> <s> they were specific assurances <e> <s> but i can say that we are willing to have another look at the clause particularly to see whether we can make more explicit the principle that an arrested person must be fingerprinted and released as quickly as is practicable <e> <s> on that basis i hope that the noble lord will allow the clause to stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i have dealt with this matter in response to questions from the noble lord on a number of occasions <e> <s> so indeed has my noble friend the lord president who spoke in the defence debate on th june last and i would refer the noble lord to what my noble friend said on that occasion <e> <s> if the noble lord wants further information i would draw his attention to paragraph of the defence white paper of which went into great detail <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said on a number of occasions the

noble lord was a member <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that circumstances have changed since the early s when these arrangements were first made <e> <s> that is why the arrangements have been re-examined on frequent occasions since then and have continued to be satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that circumstances have changed even since the time when the noble lord lord mayhew was a distinguished member of that administration but as i said just now to the noble lord lord jenkins that is why the arrangements or it is one of the reasons at least are reviewed at frequent intervals <e>", "<cs> i must confess that i was not prepared to do that but i agree that it would be a good thing to try at least <e> <s> if the committee will bear with me while i condense my six speeches into one then i will do my best <e>", "<cs> indeed <e>", "<cs> subsection permits a person brought to a police station under arrest to be searched to the extent that the custody officer considers necessary to enable him to ascertain the property the person has on him <e> <s> this amendment would narrow the scope of this power and also seek to base it upon an objective test <e> <s> may i deal with that point first <e> <s> in our view the correct test in these circumstances is the <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord donaldson has said subsection of this clause sets out the criteria that must be satisfied before the custody officer may retain the clothes and personal effects of a person detained at a police station <e> <s> the subsection makes it clear that such articles may not be taken and withheld from a detained person as a matter of routine still less as a kind of punishment <e> <s> i am sure that your lordships committee will readily recognise however that the police frequently have to deal with dangerous or disturbed individuals who simply cannot be allowed to keep potential weapons with them when they are placed in cells <e>", "<cs> i am prepared to make a long speech advising the noble lord not to press this amendment but perhaps i could just rely on a little personal experience in this matter <e> <s> as the noble lord will recall i had some responsibility for deranged people when i was at the department of health and indeed the affairs of one or two deranged soldiers come across my desk from time to time <e> <s> i think that these are proper provisions <e> <s> however i am prepared to consider the matter further if the noble lord will withdraw his amendment <e> <s> if there is anything i can add i shall certainly write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness may not be surprised to hear that this amendment presents us with some difficulties <e> <s> i share the noble baronesss concern that the protection given to juveniles in police custody should be increased and in various ways the bill and its codes of practice all achieve this <e> <s> but i cannot commend the amendment <e> <s> it is not only impracticable but also unnecessary <e> <s> it is impracticable because it would require the authority of a superintendent before clothing could be removed <e> <s> there would have to be a superintendent permanently on duty at each police station in the country on hand to endorse the custody officers decision to get a year-old to take his jacket off for example <e> <s> whether or not a search is necessary and if so how thorough it should be are bread and butter decisions for the custody officer and are properly his responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness and i have discussed this issue on a great number of occasions <e> <s> the answer to the noble baronesss question is that we are seeking a more flexible and in many cases a lower priced regime with regard to air fares <e> <s> we have to do this in consultation with the other governments concerned and we are making a little progress witness our quite recent agreement with the dutch <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that it is not possible for the government unilaterally as i believe the noble baroness is asking to sweep away all the regulations to which she has taken exception <e> <s> the government are at one with the noble baroness in that we agree that in many cases the fare regimes are over-restrictive and unnecessarily complex <e> <s> we welcome moves to correct that position but we are not in a position to do so unilaterally <e> <s> we have to do it bilaterally with the other governments concerned <e> <s> that we are seeking to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the government can obtain the benefit of the views of the noble baroness without having to employ her <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that that is the case with the very cheapest fare which is now being offered on the routes between the united kingdom and the netherlands <e> <s> i do not believe that this is the case with all the fares <e> <s> if the noble lord cares to inquire a little more carefully of the airlines concerned he may find there are some fares which are to his liking which do not carry the conditions to which he takes exception <e>", "<cs> my lords i should certainly like a greater range of lower air fares such as those which i am told one can obtain through a bucket shop to be made available particularly on some of the longer routes <e> <s> that is why we are seeking to persuade the other governments concerned that this would be a good idea <e> <s> we are having just a little success <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if the noble baroness is having difficulty in pinning me down as she says but the difficulty of the proposal which she puts to me is that she is asking for these unauthorised air fares as some of them but not all of them are to be made available with government blessing and that i am afraid i cannot agree to <e>", "<cs> my lords if we achieve as much in the next months as we have achieved in the last months we shall not be doing that badly because the last -month period has included the dutch agreement to which i have referred <e>", "<cs> my lords we made our concern known to the south african authorities shortly after we heard about these arrests <e> <s> they have since been released <e> <s> i understand the authorities in windhoek have now confirmed that no charges will be laid <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very happy to receive the accolade of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft army air force and naval discipline acts continuation order laid before the house on th june be approved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord lord mayhew for the flattering terms in which he closed his remarks just now <e> <s> i am afraid he overestimates the influence which i have in these matters but i will certainly see that his views at least are represented at an appropriate level <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that those in responsible positions particularly in connecton with young entrants to the services are given special briefing and instruction on these matters and are given advice on how to detect the signs of drug abuse and to do something about it <e> <s> i do not want to be complacent about this <e> <s> i recognise that one case of drug abuse is one too many and i certainly would not wish to rest on some defence along the lines that our problem is less than it is maybe in some other armed forces <e>", "<cs> my lords i could not give a blanket assurance of that kind because some of the problems will need legislation of one kind or another <e> <s> however i certainly confirm that problems such as those of drug abuse which are very much in the mind of the noble lord lord graham are matters which we can often deal with in a much shorter timescale than that <e> <s> we certainly want to take advantage of making whatever improvements we can without waiting for legislation where we have the powers to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that our reports of the speech to which my noble friend refers differ from those which may have appeared in the press but our views about the communiqu are of course quite clear <e>", "<cs> yes my lords of course <e>", "<cs> my lords the communiqu was not all bad because for example it said that they were hoping to solve their problems by peaceful means <e> <s> with regard to the possibility of spains entry into the european economic community we have of course made our position clear on that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords neither of these reports has yet been received <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport expects to receive the civil aviation authoritys report on its review of airline competition policy within the next few days and that of the inspector into the stansted/heathrow terminal inquiries later this summer <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness is referring to the civil aviation authoritys report then i have to say that the matter of a debate is not one for me but is one for the usual channels <e> <s> i am certain that they will take note of the views of the noble baroness <e> <s> i imagine that it will also rather depend on what the report says <e>", "<cs> my lords lasting damage is the last thing that my right honourable friend would wish to inflict upon british airways or any other company <e> <s> as to the question of a debate that is not a matter for me but i have no doubt that many noble lords will want to express their views to their respective chief whips on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i imagine that my right honourable friend will want to publish the report in due course <e> <s> indeed it may be possible that the civil aviation authority will do so before then but that will be a matter for them <e>", "<cs> again my lords that is not a matter for me <e> <s> the noble baroness will very likely want to raise this matter in your lordships house anyway but it might be that if the report does not propose any major changes the pressure for a debate will be less <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that there is more than one respectable view about what the right way forward may be in these matters <e> <s> i am afraid i cannot go so far as to give the noble lord the assurance he seeks but i am certain that my right honourable friend will have the consideration he mentioned very much in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords in the absence of a decision to do what my noble friend is anticipating i cannot answer his question <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not seeking to establish the circumstances in which such a debate may or may not take place <e> <s> that will be a matter for noble lords and noble baronesses when they see the report and decide for themselves whether the matter is such that they wish to raise it <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i should like to repeat a statement to be made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs about the abduction of mr umaru dikko <e> <s> the statement reads as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both the noble and learned lord and the noble lord for their response <e> <s> perhaps i may deal first with the questions put to me by the noble lord lord kennet <e> <s> i am afraid that i am not yet in the position to tell him when my right honourable friends examination of the provisions of the vienna convention will be complete but i can tell him that it is underway <e> <s> as for the legal position of foreigners resident in this country of course they have to obey our laws not only laws of the kind which we have seen broken recently but also the immigration regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords the nigerian government have denied any involvement in this very serious matter <e> <s> nevertheless i have to say that police inquiries have suggested that some nigerian high commission officials were implicated <e> <s> that is as far as i can go <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that mr dikko has now left hospital though no doubt the long-term effects will take a little longer to dissipate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not certain that the fact that this was the report of an all-party committee as the noble lord rightly says necessarily gives it a monopoly of wisdom on the matter <e> <s> but i can say that in the governments view the committees description of the process of assessing information and formulating policy in a fast moving situation is oversimplified and relies heavily on hindsight <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the noble lord is quite right that the americans have indicated that it would have been better if we had been consulted earlier <e> <s> we are of course in constant touch with the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether the noble lord has it entirely right <e> <s> the actions that the government took at the time are not ones that we would now wish to have changed even with the benefit of hindsight <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is right to suggest that there was a wide range of views as to the merits or otherwise of the american action <e> <s> if i may say so i think that it is in our interests in maintaining the two-way flow between our countries that not only do we seek to persuade the americans of our views but we listen to their views as well <e>", "<cs> my lords it is i fear the case that a country such as ours and of the size of ours is not able to have the facilities in every part of the world for which the noble lord is calling but we take what steps we can to ensure that the arrangements are the most appropriate that we can make <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that it is a retrograde step to neglect intelligence matters anywhere <e> <s> but having said that there is a limit to what we can do <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will forgive me if i do not go into details <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that we do not for a moment wish to be complacent about these matters as the noble lord suggests <e> <s> we were informed in advance of what was proposed but as i said just now in answer to an earlier question we certainly would have wished that the consultation had been earlier and more full <e>", "<cs> my lords that seems to be a matter of elementary arithmetic <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to hear about the disquiet to which the noble lord has referred but i believe that the facts are as i have described them <e> <s> i understand that the trustees of the south atlantic fund have considered the claims from men suffering from psychiatric illness in the same way as they have considered claims from men suffering from physical injuries <e> <s> one of the factors that they have had to take into account is the extent to which such illness was suffered as a result of the conflict <e> <s> that is of course much more difficult to determine in psychiatric cases than in physical injury cases <e> <s> i can tell the noble lord that i think that there have been about a dozen cases so far <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> in responding to the arguments that have been put forward i am conscious that both on this amendment and on a number of amendments that follow we shall be covering territory already explored in some detail in another place <e> <s> i make no complaint of that <e> <s> but the effect of this amendment would be to require the secretary of state to seek the authority of both houses of parliament before he made a scheme <e> <s> but this is precisely what he is doing now in bringing this bill before parliament <e> <s> this is an enabling bill which permits the secretary of state to make schemes as well as to determine when they shall come into force <e> <s> if parliament gives its authority to these actions covered by the bill what would be the point in asking for the same authority again somewhat later on <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to say that i am not able to accept this amendment <e> <s> we have already announced our intention to establish a holding company and four subsidiary companies wholly owned by the holding company which in turn will be wholly owned by the secretary of state <e> <s> the bill is drafted in such a way as to enable this to the done and <e>", "<cs> i had understood that it might be for the convenience of the committee if we take amendment no <e> <s> with my noble friends amendment together of course with amendment no <e> <s> which i believe she agrees is linked with it <e>", "<cs> i am not sure why it is necessary to exclude every conceivable foreign shareholder provided of course that the limit is kept at the level that i have suggested where no vestige of control is conceivably possible <e>", "<cs> i do not think the noble lord has understood the arrangements correctly <e> <s> the control of activities of that sort is covered by the special share issued to the secretary of state to which i referred during my remarks <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend has not seen them i shall certainly see that she has a copy <e>", "<cs> i believe that this amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> the legal and trade union rights of any employee whether in the royal ordnance factories or elsewhere are protected by legislation already <e> <s> as i am sure your lordships are aware the employment protection consolidation act guarantees the right of employees to belong to and to take part in the activities of a trades union <e> <s> if a company tries to dismiss an employee for belonging to or taking part in the activities of a trades union that employee can seek redress in an industrial tribunal <e> <s> no employer may contract out of these provisions of the act <e> <s> employees of the rofs will be entitled to all their trades union rights at the date of transfer and the company will not be able subsequently to deprive them of those rights so the amendment is redundant <e>", "<cs> as your lordships will appreciate the purpose of subsection of clause of the bill is to protect the creditors of any company out of which property is transferred by means of a scheme made under clause <e>", "<cs> i am not sure whether the noble lord lord graham wants me to dilate on the duties of the auditors of the company <e> <s> i will do my best off the top of my head as they say to help the noble lord <e> <s> as i recall the position and i confess that i am not an expert in these matters but i believe that the noble lord lord diamond is an expert the arrangement is that the auditors are appointed by the directors under the companies act <e> <s> the auditors duties are laid down in the companies act <e> <s> but as far as the question of the valuation is concerned i believe that the arrangement and this applies to every company is that the directors propose a valuation of the assets involved in their company and it is up to the auditors to decide whether they are able to accept that valuation or not either in the light of their own knowledge or in the light of any expert opinion that they may take <e>", "<cs> i am not certain that there is much more that i can say to help the noble lord <e> <s> when i spoke just now in response to his amendment while we were debating the earlier amendment of the noble lord lord graham i pointed to the role of the auditors <e> <s> the noble lord was subsequently good enough to say that i had got it roughly right <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord is not suggesting i am sure that he is not that auditors of the distinction of the firm that i mentioned or indeed any firm of auditors being professionally qualified people as they must be would be other than independent and unbiased <e> <s> no doubt some are better than others but i am quite certain that the proposals that we set out in the bill and which are inherent in the proposal for the creation of a companies act company provide for a proper and independent valuation of the assets or at least for a proper and independent assessment of the value and a checking of the value <e> <s> on reflection i hope that the noble lord will not press his amendment <e>", "<cs> at the risk of boring your lordships and at the risk of repeating myself yet again the valuers will eventually be the auditors of the company <e> <s> they are the independent valuers and independent auditors of the company are required to be independent and are required to be appointed under the companies act <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me i think that he is ascribing to the art or science of valuation whichever it may be rather more mystery than perhaps really exists <e> <s> if we are thinking of property i hastily accept that property is best valued by property valuation experts <e> <s> i guess that it is more of an art than a science because the value of property goes up and down in some extraordinary ways <e>", "<cs> i do not want to seem intransigent about these matters <e> <s> if the noble lord lord diamond wants to withdraw his amendment in the context of my looking at this matter again then i should be happy to do so <e> <s> i am not sure that i shall come up with any better ideas than those which i have offered to your lordships already but if that would help the noble lord i should be happy to give that assurance <e>", "<cs> i fully understand your lordships concern about each of the matters raised by these amendments <e> <s> they are serious points and deserve to be taken seriously <e> <s> of course it is the departments responsibility to ensure that our armed forces are properly equipped with modern efficient and effective weapons and at the right price and that the necessary manufacturing facilities are available to ensure a continuous and reliable supply to the extent that any foreseeable demand can be promptly met <e> <s> the committee will not i hope be surprised that these matters have already been the subject of detailed consideration within the ministry of defence <e> <s> we should have been failing in our duty if we had not done so <e> <s> but the conclusions we have come to are not such as would lead us to support these amendments <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord diamond decides what to do with his amendment if he has not already made up his mind i would ask your lordships to get the matter into perspective <e> <s> the noble lord lord diamond referred to the fact that per <e>", "<cs> i understand that this would be an appropriate moment for us to discontinue our consideration of this matter <e> <s> i therefore beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> i understand that the noble lords understanding of the matter is as always entirely correct <e>", "<cs> the workforce of the royal ordnance factories have of course a legitimate and understandable interest in the success of he rof enterprise <e> <s> the government obviously wish to carry the workforce with it in making its proposals about the future <e> <s> we are already consulting fully the trades union representatives of the employees about the change of status and we have made available detailed information about the future organisation of the companies <e> <s> i have no doubt that full consultation arrangements will be worked out before incorporation i emphasise before incorporation to provide for an effective dialogue between management and employees after the change of status <e> <s> the workforce will be able to make their views known to management and through them to the secretary of state as shareholder during the wholly-owned phase <e> <s> so let us not pretend then that the workforce are being left out of any dialogue about the change of status <e>", "<cs> we shall of course be going deeply into this matter in later amendments <e> <s> first of all i should say this <e> <s> what we are offering to the employees who want to move across is what is for all practical purposes identical terms and conditions under the new arrangements <e> <s> we are still in the course of consultations with the trade unions <e> <s> they have raised one or two points on which they are still seeking to make representations and we are of course listening to them with the greatest care <e> <s> we are certainly having constructive consultations but that does not mean that the government have to put themselves in the position of accepting willy-nilly everything that is suggested <e> <s> we are entering and conducting the <e>", "<cs> i fear that the proposed appointments of directors in a representative capacity would be quite inappropriate <e> <s> it would not follow normal commercial practice nor the companies acts provisions about election by the shareholders and we see no reason for it <e> <s> the government quite understand and accept the legitimate interests of the workforce in the success of the rof enterprise <e> <s> the board of directors of the rof company will have the same interests <e> <s> it is notable that section of the companies act provides that the directors are to have regard to the interests of the companys employees in general as well as to the interests of the companys shareholders <e> <s> that duty is owed by them to the company as a whole rather than to any particular faction or interest within the company <e>", "<cs> i have done that already <e>", "<cs> the noble lord says that these directors would not be appointed as representing any particular faction but i think it is absolutely invevitable that two directors appointed specifically in accordance with the legislative provisions which the noble lord proposes would be seen as representing the employees <e> <s> after all that is what it says in the amendment which the noble lord is proposing to the committee <e> <s> i read from his amendment <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> i agree of course that no individual would be forced onto the board <e> <s> what i am putting to the committee is that it is difficult to ensure that it is the expertise that is put on the board <e> <s> two persons must be found <e> <s> i am not sure that it would be possible to be certain that we always found those with the expertise which we all agree would be desirable <e>", "<cs> i think that is probably correct that the directors generally appointed by the shareholders or at least whose appointment is confirmed by the shareholders take into account the interests of the shareholders <e> <s> but i would have to say that the interests of the company and the interests of the shareholders are very difficult to disentangle <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord is helping to make my case for me <e> <s> all the examples that he quotes of the beneficial effect of non-executive directors being appointed to a company are advantages with which i would wholly agree but those directors are not appointed because of some provision in the memorandum and articles or in an act of parliament <e> <s> they are appointed because of the views of the shareholders and indeed of the directors <e> <s> i think that that goes to show that the best way is to leave it to the shareholders and the directors and not put a provision into the bill as the noble lord proposes <e>", "<cs> i am pleased to be able to assure the noble lord that the government certainly intend that the new royal ordnance company shall include in its articles of association an article creating a special share carrying with it certain rights which will be owned indefinitely by the secretary of state or by some other minister of the crown <e> <s> among the rights which this share will confer on its holder will be a right to veto a disposal of the whole or a material part of the assets of the company and its subsidiaries <e> <s> a part is deemed to be material if its value is not less than per cent <e> <s> of the book value of the net assets of the group or if the average profits attributable to it represents at least per cent <e> <s> of the average profits of the group over the previous three years <e>", "<cs> if i misled the noble lord on an earlier occasion i apologise <e> <s> but if i remember rightly we were talking about something else <e> <s> let me look up the words that i used previously if i have anything to correct i shall hasten to do so <e>", "<cs> has the noble lord noted that it is not possible to import any bananas at the moment <e>", "<cs> it will be no surprise i fear that i must ask your lordships to reject the amendment which would delay our plans for incorporation of the rofs for a year <e> <s> the government have introduced this bill with a specific aim and for specific reasons <e> <s> your lordships will understand that much work has been going on with the plan of a vesting day on st october <e> <s> we have been forced to accept a delay in the passage of the bill until the close of the session in late october and as your lordships will be aware we have tabled an amendment to clause to avoid further delay <e> <s> as i shall explain when we reach the debate on the clause amendment the government want to see incorporation as soon as practicable <e>", "<cs> this was one of the matters covered by the earlier amendments to which the noble lord had put his name and which in the event he did not move <e> <s> i wonder if perhaps i may look into the point that the noble lord raises and if there is anything i can tell him i will write to him before the next stage <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has explained these amendments are concerned with the actions of the government on privatisation of the royal ordnance company <e> <s> in transferring the royal ordnance factories from the public to the private sector it is of course the governments main purpose to increase competition <e> <s> the government would therefore not look with favour on a concentration of manufacturing resources in fewer hands following a flotation of shares in the new company <e>", "<cs> i should perhaps remind your lordships that this bill seeks to permit the incorporation of the rof organisation as a companies acts company as the first part of a two-stage operation <e> <s> the timing of subsequent privatisation how it is to be done and who will be involved will be a matter for my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e> <s> this bill merely lays down some guidelines which he will be required to follow <e>", "<cs> as a member of this administration i am very reluctant to require boards of companies to do anything at all <e> <s> however i have told the noble lord that the government at the time of the flotation will be the per cent <e> <s> shareholder in the organisation and i think that he can be assured that matters will then proceed in accordance with his liking <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that notwithstanding what my noble friend has said in support of it i see a number of objections to this amendment <e> <s> the real essence of the matter as we perceive it is whether or not there should be included in the bill a specific requirement about subsequent discussion in parliament whether because an affirmative resolution is required or otherwise before the secretary of state can dispose of any of his securities of the rof company <e> <s> if this is the essence of the matter we have had a very full discussion of it in the other place and on second reading in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> i do hope the noble lord will not persist in this line of argument <e> <s> we discussed that fully at an earlier stage on this bill and to the satisfaction of my noble friends i was able to dispose of that point <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will look at the <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill requires schemes made under it to be laid before parliament within one month of their coming into force <e> <s> notwithstanding the terms of this provision the government are quite prepared to lay the first scheme before parliament on vesting day which will be the day on which the scheme takes effect <e>", "<cs> in answering the noble lord i should say at the outset that the government recognise that it has always been the desire of the employees of the royal ordnance factories and rightly so that the terms and conditions of their new employment in the rof company shall be no less favourable taken as a whole than the terms and conditions of their employment in the civil service <e> <s> for their part the <e>", "<cs> no i was seeking only to reply to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> deals essentially with arrangements after the vesting day of the new company <e> <s> it lays an obligation on the new company to conduct its negotiations and industrial relations in a certain way <e> <s> i hope to carry your lordships with me when i say that this surely must be a matter for the management of the rofs to determine not this bill <e> <s> it surely goes without saying too that as a commercial organisation on a par with other companies the rofs will seek to maintain the best possible industrial relations by negotiation and agreement between management and the trades unions representing the workforce <e>", "<cs> i must say that i detect an air of mistrust of the government on the part of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> if i have misinterpreted the attitude of the noble lord then of course i hasten to withdraw <e> <s> but the government have made pledges about pensions for employees transferred to the new rof company <e> <s> we stand by those pledges and continue to negotiate with the trade unions about them <e> <s> our commitment is a matter of public record <e> <s> i do not therefore agree that any provision about pensions needs to be written into the bill <e> <s> the government <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble lord takes that view <e> <s> i have to tell him that i once worked in a company where i was a comparatively new entrant and the pension scheme that i had the benefit of was actually less favourable than the scheme for some of the more senior employees in the company who had transferred in from another company which my company had taken over <e> <s> the arrangements to which the noble lord has drawn attention are not in fact particularly novel <e>", "<cs> with respect to my noble friend i think i dealt with these points or ones very similar to them on an earlier amendment <e> <s> i am not sure whether she was in her place at that time but perhaps my noble friend may not have understood that i was about to deal with parallel points <e> <s> if my noble friend would like to study what i said in response to that amendment although i would not want to put her under any obligation in that way if she is then not <e>", "<cs> my understanding is that the provisions to which my noble friend refers will be such that once the companies are set up in the private sector then certainly the effect of the health and safety at work legislation and the other legislation too to which my noble friend referred will apply <e> <s> perhaps i can look into the matter with more care and if i am wrong i will write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i have no announcements to make in regard to that matter <e> <s> the government will of course have to consider the implications of the decisions which your lordships took earlier today and decide how to proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords if i have your permission to speak again <e>", "<cs> my lords may i then say first in answer to the noble lord lord mishcon that i believe the constable can still be asked even if this amendment is carried as i hope it will be why it appears to him that the purpose of the search might be frustrated if he were to follow some other course of action <e> <s> i do not believe that the effect of the amendment would be to exempt the constable from <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two considerations i would put to your lordships <e> <s> either the words are indeed superflous as the government now believe and in which case the amendment is appropriate or else the words do imply a reasonableness test in which case the unlooked consequences which would flow from that test remaining in the bill will follow and it is right therefore to agree to the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a feeling that i am free to give that assurance in fact i now find that i am and i am happy to do so <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope your lordships will accept my presence at this dispatch box as a pale imitation if not a pale shadow of my noble friend <e> <s> i sympathise with the desire of the noble lord lord monson to compensate those detained and then released without charge <e> <s> i do not pretend that being detained by the police for a lengthy period is likely to be other than an unpleasant experience for the person concerned but the noble lords scheme would compensate him financially whatever the circumstances and that is indeed a radical departure <e>", "<cs> my lords i must stop short of giving the noble lord the sort of assurance for which he asks because that will depend upon what is decided <e> <s> however i can assure the noble lord that the views that he has expressed will be fully taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords the promotional fares to which the noble baroness refers are the fares properly authorised and published by the airlines concerned <e> <s> it is those fares that the foreign office are as are other government departments seeking to take the best advantage of <e> <s> as for the first part of the noble baronesss supplementary question the documents to which the noble baroness has referred today and on the previous occasion when she raised this matter are publications widely available and it is not i think the role of the civil aviation authority necessarily to vet all such documents <e>", "<cs> my lords that document is being published today and i will let the noble baroness have a copy this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords we do agree that there have been some very serious abuses of human rights in uganda <e> <s> however we take the view that across the country there has been some improvement in recent years and i believe that that can to some extent be ascribed to the work done by our military training team in that country <e> <s> it is for that reason that we plan that the training team should continue <e>", "<cs> my lords the size of our training team in that country is consisting of eight ncos and five officers <e> <s> i believe we can claim that the work of that team has resulted in improved discipline and efficiency of the ugandan army <e> <s> the purpose of the team is to train junior officers and ncos for the ugandan army <e> <s> we believe that they have been very successful in that role <e> <s> indeed in the area where the team is working we can point to a significant improvement in the security and human rights situation <e>", "<cs> my lords we hope that that is the case <e> <s> in addition to the million to which i have referred we are making certain specific sums of money available in areas where there is a particular need for example <e> <s> for food aid and we are clear that that is getting through to the areas where it is most needed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the right reverend prelate for his complimentary words about the work of the team there which underlines what i said earlier <e> <s> as for the possibility of increasing the size of the team i am afraid that the problem is as always one of resources <e> <s> i can give no assurance to the right reverend prelate that we shall be able to do that but naturally we shall keep the matter under review <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the specific ranks of the ncos <e> <s> i believe they are senior ncos <e> <s> in addition to the ncos there are a colonel two majors and two captains <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that we should do everything we can to assist the ugandan government and the ugandan army in their endeavours to improve the situation but uganda is of course a sovereign country and we have to stop short of interfering in the internal affairs of that country <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise if this answer is a little longer than usual <e> <s> the government published on th october a white paper setting out their policy on airline competition <e> <s> its primary objective is to encourage a sound and competitive multi-airline industry <e> <s> internationally the government will promote competition by negotiating more liberal arrangements for air services either by open skies policies where possible or by designation of more than one british carrier wherever britains interests are not prejudiced <e> <s> for domestic services the civil aviation authority proposes to relax the present licensing restrictions <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords we shall certainly be seeking to do that <e> <s> as my noble friend will recall it is not always a matter for her majestys government alone but wherever possible we shall seek to achieve agreements that will provide the benefits that he points to <e> <s> can i instance for example the recent agreement with the netherlands which has achieved just that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that that is not a matter for me <e> <s> but i am certain that the remarks of the noble baroness will have been heard by my noble friend who is sitting beside me on the front bench <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that pooling agreements continue to exist on only a few routes now <e> <s> but that will be a matter for the civil aviation authority in the first instance and secondly now for the director-general of fair trading <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the best deal for the passengers and for the taxpayers is the one that will be embodied in the proposals that we are bringing forward and i hope that they will have the support of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the difficulty with that proposal in the circumstances in which we now find ourselves and of course the edwards committee was years ago now is that we should be rather distorting the comparatively free licensing procedure that we now enjoy <e> <s> for that reason i think that the government would have difficulty with the proposal to which the noble lord refers <e>", "<cs> my lords we have yet to announce in detail the arrangements for the privatisation of british airways <e> <s> but in the end the taxpayer will get a very good deal <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the proposals that my right honourable friend has recently brought forward achieve what my noble friend is looking for <e> <s> they have been arrived at by agreement with all the parties concerned and i am therefore satisfied that the difficulties he points to will not arise in practice <e>", "<cs> my lords as i told the noble lord lord hatch of lusby on th march the argentine cruiser belgrano was attacked because it posed an unacceptable threat to units of the british task force <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i have now lost count of the number of questions on that matter which the government have answered both in reply to the noble lord and to right honourable and honourable members in another place <e> <s> if the noble lord would like to have the latest information <e> <s> i suggest that he refers to the letters recently sent by my right honourable friend the prime minister to various right honourable and honourable members in another place <e> <s> i will place copies in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not an expert in naval tactics but i imagine that my noble friend may be and i am sure that he is right <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not yet seen the letter to which the right reverend prelate refers but i shall draw it to the attention of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords no i do not think that the noble lords suggestion is one which we ought to follow <e> <s> the observations of the noble and gallant lord lord lewin to which the noble lord refers i think were made from his memory and i have to say that the documentary evidence does not support them <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the noble and gallant lords recollection of the verbal communication is confined to the noble and gallant lord <e>", "<cs> my lords again my noble friends knowledge of these matters is a good deal greater than mine <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend is correct <e> <s> it is perhaps worth recalling that units of the argentine air force had attacked units of our fleet the previous day <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i wholly concur with his view <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the view of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords the position of the belgrano inside or outside the exclusion zone had nothing to do with the threat that she posed to our task force <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an interesting question but outside the scope of this one <e>", "<cs> my lords it is indeed the case that the conduct of the war was the responsibility of the war cabinet under my right honourable friend the prime minister <e> <s> but the conduct of the battle was not that was the responsibility of the commanders on the spot <e> <s> there is no truth in the suggestion that my right honourable friend the prime minister telephoned the commander of the conqueror and ordered him to fire the torpedoes <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the concern of the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran and the noble lord lord graham that nothing in the bill or in any of the schemes to be made under it should place civil servants currently working in the rofs in a worse position with regard to their rights in intellectual property including their rights to apply for an award of compensation <e> <s> i hope to be able to assure noble lords that this will not happen and that there are ample safeguards both in the bill and under the general law for those rights of employees <e>", "<cs> my lords to be frank i believe that it had been agreed that amendments nos <e> <s> and would be taken together <e> <s> although i agree that the noble lords earlier remarks did not specifically address themselves to amendment no <e> <s> the fact is that these matters are fairly closely intertwined and it is difficult for me to answer one without answering the other particularly as the noble lord lord graham has spoken to his amendments at the same time <e> <s> however in any event i shall deal with the point about which the noble lord is now concerned and i hope to be able to satisfy him on that matter also <e>", "<cs> my lords if i have your lordships permission to speak again and the noble lords permission to intervene in his closing remarks might i ask him what mischief he apprehends is going to happen in the light of the arrangements being in place that i have described <e> <s> it seems to me that the concern in the noble lords mind was that these most valuable intellectual property rights should not transfer to the new enterprise but should remain available to the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i can reassure both noble lords that this amendment really is not necessary <e> <s> the rof employees will not be in any worse position as a result of the change in status <e> <s> the position of crown servants is already the same as that of employees in the private sector as a result of the patents act <e> <s> the transfer of employees from the department to the new company will make no difference whatsoever to their statutory rights with regard to intellectual property <e>", "<cs> my lords the arguments deployed by my noble friend lord trenchard were very much those which were in my mind when we considered this matter at an earlier stage of the bill <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that only a very small percentage out of the total of our defence requirements is provided by the royal ordnance factories <e> <s> this is not to say that the amendment does not contain the germ at least of an important point and i shall seek to reply to it <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may have the noble lords permission to intervene again i fear that i could not have made myself clear when i spoke earlier <e> <s> there is no difficulty that we see about spare capacity in the royal ordnance factories and i think this was very much in the mind of the noble and gallant lord being available for use in times of crisis <e> <s> we see no reason why that capacity should not be maintained in times not of crisis by means of contract between the ministry of defence and the royal ordnance factories <e> <s> as i said during my earlier remarks that contract may very well arise from a contract arranging for the original supply of the goods concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid the government are no more able to accept this amendment now than we were when we discussed it in committee <e> <s> the effect would be to delay vesting day by almost a year <e> <s> the noble lord has explained why he believes such delay would be helpful but i have to say that the likely effect of any such delay would merely be to prolong existing uncertainties <e> <s> there has in fact been progress in the matter of the pensions scheme and redundancy payments which i think was uppermost in the minds of noble lords when we last discussed this matter since this amendment was last before your lordships <e> <s> in the interval i understand that the trade unions have been able to satisfy themselves as to a number of technical points arising on the pensions scheme <e> <s> i accept that there are still some outstanding issues and i hope that these can be quickly resolved one way or another <e>", "<cs> my lords i explained during our discussion of this amendment in committee the reasons why the government cannot accept it <e> <s> we have made it clear that we intend to seek the introduction of private capital into the rofs once they are a companies act organisation and that we see no reason why privatisation should be long delayed <e> <s> we have also made it clear that the most likely route for privatisation is by a stock exchange flotation of the whole enterprise although we have also made it clear that we do not rule out separate disposals of subsidiary companies should such a course make sense <e>", "<cs> my lords in committee i explained to the noble lord lord diamond and i am sorry that he is unable to be with us today that the government are quite prepared to lay the first scheme before parliament on vesting day and to publish any memorandum of understanding except in so far as considerations of commercial sensitivity demand otherwise as i said just now in answer to an earlier amendment no later than vesting day should it be ready by then <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord and the house allow me to intervene <e> <s> a future government could of course pass new legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to start by saying that amendment no <e> <s> the first of the three we are considering is unnecessary <e> <s> clause taken together with clause of the bill requires the secretary of state to obtain the consent of the treasury to any disposal of shares <e> <s> those subsections apply to the disposal of shares issued to the secretary of state under the provisions of a scheme and also in respect of any securities which he may have subsequently acquired whether by purchase capitalisation issue or otherwise <e> <s> it follows that any disposal made to accord with the setting of a government investment limit can have effect only if the treasury gives its consent <e> <s> there is nothing in clause to suggest otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords clause of the bill deals with the liabilities which will be transferred from the secretary of state for defence to the new rof company <e> <s> in the most improbable event of the royal ordnance company being wound up at some point in the future any outstanding amounts of those liabilities which have been transferred to it will fall to the secretary of state to meet <e> <s> however the payment of pensions is not such a transferred liability <e> <s> the government will completely discharge that liability by the payment of transfer values in respect of the accrued pension rights of those transferred employees who choose to transfer their rights to the new company pension scheme <e> <s> thereafter the company is liable to pay the pensions <e> <s> liquidation of the company would have no effect on the ability to pay these pensions because the pension fund is separate from the companys own finances and as we have previously explained will be suitably financed to meet the pension obligations transferred to it from the civil service <e>", "<cs> my lords we are working on this at the moment <e> <s> i do not have an announcement to make about it tonight i am afraid and i cannot tell the noble lord precisely when i shall be able to do so <e> <s> on the question of the trade unions and the pensions we are still in discussion with the trade unions on this matter <e> <s> speaking for myself in the light of the information i have i believe that it will be possible to reach an agreement with the trade unions on the basis anyway of what we propose <e> <s> perhaps it would be wiser for me to say that i hope that we can reach an agreement but grasping the wider consideration i also believe so <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will permit me i think it would be right if i were to intervene now to say that no redundancies at bishopton have been announced but i will come to the position when i reply in a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have read very carefully the speech of the noble lord when he moved this amendment in committee and i have listened equally carefully to what he has said today <e>", "<cs> my lords if the house will allow me to intervene again there is not much i can add to that which i have already said except to emphasise that if changes to the contract of employement are to be made in respect of employees whether they be industrial or non-industrial after vesting day then that will be a matter for agreement between the trade unions and the company <e> <s> in my view the trade unions are fully protected against the anxieties which they have expressed because if they feel aggrieved they will have the remedy of the procedures to which i have already referred <e> <s> i hope that <e> <s> upon reflection <e> <s> they too will accept that we have gone a long way in fact the whole way to meet the anxieties that they have expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a slightly arcane point but an important one nonetheless <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will forgive me if i try to explain it at a little length because i believe that i can assuage the fears of the noble lord <e> <s> i understand perfectly the point which the noble lord has made and i have considerable sympathy with it <e> <s> however i do not believe that it is necessary to make this amendment to the bill <e> <s> the point is already provided for and covered earlier in schedule <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would allow me yes that is indeed what i said <e> <s> unless it is after vesting day that the company get an agreed change to the terms and conditions which apply in which case of course some different arrangement would be in operation or if they chose to impose the changes unilaterally as i indicated they would be open to consideration of the application of the employment protection legislation or even the general law <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with interest to what the noble lord has had to say in <e>", "<cs> my lords if i have your lordships permission to speak again i think that i can really help the noble lord <e> <s> if after vesting day an employee takes the view that he does not have as nearly as can be arranged having regard to the fact that the new company does not involve employment under the crown terms and conditions as nearly equivalent as they possibly can be he is entitled to take the matter to the industrial tribunal or indeed to some other form of court <e> <s> it seems to me at least i confess that i am not a lawyer in regard to this matter or any other that that would amount to constructive dismissal and there are proper legal remedies in that situation <e>", "<cs> my lords this same amendment was moved in committee by i think the noble lord lord diamond and the noble lord lord graham was interested in the matter at that time <e> <s> i have since written to both noble lords about the legal position regarding redundancy compensation as affected by the provisions of tupe about which the noble lord lord diamond expressed concern <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that that has not happened but i hope that what i now have to say will reassure the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am now able to tell the noble lord that as i understand it the scottish cases have been totally discredited and nobody now relies upon them <e> <s> i hope that that is not lse-majest of the scottish court but <e> <s> as i am advised that is the position <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to what the noble lord has said in support of this amendment which is very much the same as we heard during the committee stage though that does not make it any less relevant <e> <s> i am afraid that that means that what i say is also very much in accordance with what i said at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am bound to say that i find myself in some difficulty at this moment because it seems to me that the noble lords remarks were addressed to amendment no <e> <s> which is specifically on the question of where the ministry of defence police ought to be deployed while the amendment we are actually considering is amendment no <e> <s> coupled with amendment no <e> <s> and they cover rather a different topic <e> <s> however let me reply to the speech which the noble lord has made which is really addressed to the issue of whether and where the ministry of defence police ought to be deployed <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess i have been somewhat puzzled by the speeches that i have heard <e> <s> the noble lord lord stoddart in speaking to amendment no <e> <s> and i think amendment no <e> <s> said not one word to do with either of those amendments that i could detect <e> <s> he made a speech which i think could reasonably be said to be in support of amendment no <e> <s> and i thereupon replied to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the noble lord lord graham then made another speech on what was effectively amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> therefore in my view i have been asked to reply twice to the same amendment and i am not sure that i regard that as wholly satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a very grave charge <e>", "<cs> and quite without foundation <e>", "<cs> on st march there were dwellings which had been provided for civilian occupation on the defence estate <e> <s> of which were vacant <e> <s> the rental income including in some cases an element for rates was in <e> <s> these figures do not include married quarters provided for servicemen <e>", "<cs> the ministry of defence owns seven villages <e> <s>

the ministry of defence owns farms with buildings let on full agricultural tenancies in england scotland and wales <e> <s> rents received from all lettings and other use of the defence estate are credited in bulk to one vote and i regret that it is not possible to identify separately the revenue from farms <e>", "<cs> names for the remaining type s have already been selected and approved <e>

treaty as an important element in preserving international peace and security <e> <s> it would be inappropriate to participate in this type of campaign in another country <e>", "<cs> we believe there should be no preconditions to us/soviet talks and regret the soviet refusal to participate in talks in vienna which they themselves proposed <e> <s> we hope that such discussions would show that conditions exist for negotiating balanced and verifiable limitations on anti-satellite weapons <e> <s> we note that president reagan has said that <e>", "<cs> we and our european community partners continue to seek a negotiated settlement to the arab/israel dispute based on two balanced principles the right of all states in the area including israel to exist in peace and security and the right of the palestinian people to self-determination <e> <s> we stand ready to support any constructive moves by the parties towards such a settlement <e>", "<cs> the consultants were asked to review alternative options for the provision of a satisfactory electricity supply on st helena including the economic and technical feasibility of using windpower <e> <s> they concluded that a new diesel-engined power station was necessary <e> <s> but they identified an appropriate site which might be considered for the installation of wind generators for certain purposes in the future <e>", "<cs> as minutes of meetings of the executive council are confidential internal documents of the falkland islands government copies of them cannot be placed in the library of the house <e> <s> the overseas development administration did not produce a valuation of the packe brothers farm one was produced locally <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that there is some disappointment that the soviet authorities have not carried out certain of their commitments with regard to the countries of eastern europe <e> <s> indeed that has been the position of successive british governments and has been made publicly known on many occasions <e> <s> however i do not think that that would be a reason for throwing the yalta protocol overboard on the contrary i think it means that we should try harder <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the position as described by the noble lord is the correct one but there have been a good few discussions since the yalta protocols at the end of the last war <e> <s> the noble lord is quite right to say that the yalta protocols were not a formal international agreement <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not think that american administration needs any urging from us to move in that direction but they will of course enjoy any support that we can give <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not think that i could agree with my noble friend in that <e> <s> indeed many of the aspirations which emerged from the yalta protocol were confirmed and underlined in the helsinki final act of at least years after the yalta protocol was arrived at <e> <s> we are trying very hard to ensure that the soviet union live up to the undertakings they gave at helsinki at that time not least at the madrid review conference of a couple of years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords our view is that real and permanent stability in europe will be difficult to achieve so long as the german nation remains divided against its will <e>", "<cs> my lords as for the french position particularly flowing from the yalta protocol i believe it is true to say that president de gaulle was not at that time involved in the yalta conference and always took a distinctive view which has continued to be reflected in french policy <e> <s> but president mitterrand has emphasised the need to move carefully and with full preparation in lowering barriers between eastern and western europe <e>", "<cs> my lords the community and spain have reached the final stages of the accession negotiations but some important and difficult issues remain to be resolved within the community as well as with spain <e> <s> we shall be working for a speedy solution to these problems so that accession for spain and for portugal may take place as the spaniards wish on st january <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as the views of the spanish prime minister are concerned we understand and share the spanish governments concern at the slow progress in the enlargment negotiations and we shall continue to work for an early resolution of the outstanding issues <e> <s> but on the second point put to me by my noble friend we hope and believe that it will be possible to reach the sort of agreement which he wants and which we want too within the time scale to which i have referred <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first point put to me by the noble lord i can say that negotiations are currently under way on industrial tariff transition agriculture fisheries social affairs and institutions <e> <s> indeed enlargement is expected to be the prime topic for discussion at the foreign affairs council on nd and rd october in luxembourg <e> <s> we hope that the negotiations on these dossiers may be completed by the end of november although there are some knotty points still to he resolved and we may not be able to achieve that <e>", "<cs> my lords that is really a different matter which does not fall within the competence of the european community but as my noble friend knows we have made our views on that point very clear to the spaniards <e>", "<cs> my lords again our views on spanish entry into the north atlantic treaty organisation have been made very clear <e> <s> of course they did accede to the treaty organisation in <e> <s> we now hope that they will feel able in due course to enter fully into the alliances integrated military structure <e> <s> nonetheless there are still some restrictions which we regret <e> <s> however again i am not sure that that is a matter directly related to spanish entry into the european community <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is right to say that these matters are continuing to be studied within the community <e> <s> of course there are a number of difficulties which will flow from spanish accession to the european community <e> <s> however we are working to solve these difficulties most particularly in the area of the budget <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly true that the french and the italians have pointed to the problems that spanish entry will generate for the ec with regard to the agricultural policy <e> <s> that is one of the matters that will have to be resolved between now and accession <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot go further than the remarks i made just now <e> <s> as the noble lord may know my right honourable friend the foreign and commonwealth secretary met with the spanish foreign secretary recently in new york <e> <s> further meetings are planned <e> <s> i feel certain that the difficulties to which the noble lord has pointed and the difficulties about which the governments have made their position clear can be resolved in time for the accession <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope and believe that the delay which my noble friend points to will not take place <e> <s> my noble friend will know better than i the support we have given to the gibraltarians in recent years following from the restrictions that were imposed by the spaniards some time ago <e> <s> the answer to these problems is to lift those restrictions and that is the end to which we are working <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have made their position quite clear about the restrictions on the gibraltar-spanish border as regards spanish entry to the european community <e> <s> however i doubt whether these problems are best solved by one side hectoring the other about the difficulties <e> <s> we seek to persuade them to resolve these problems <e> <s> i think we have achieved that in the form of the lisbon agreement to which they agreed a couple of years ago and we are now working for the implementation of that <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so i think that my friend has it the wrong way round <e> <s> the principle of spanish and portuguese accession to the european community is something which we support very strongly indeed <e> <s> what we are now seeking to do is to solve the practical difficulties that such enlargement presents <e> <s> we are working towards that <e> <s> we have already made considerable progress <e> <s> i hope and believe that all the outstanding problems can be solved before spanish accession on st january <e>", "<cs> my lords i know of no evidence to support the suggestion that the french or the germans want us out of the community as the noble lord seems to be suggesting <e> <s> however i think the earlier part of the noble lords supplementary question underlined what i said just now <e> <s> we very strongly support the principle of spanish and portuguese accession to the european community <e> <s> we are now working to solve some of the practical difficulties in the way of that accession <e> <s> they would have joined before now had it not been for those difficulties <e> <s> we hope and believe that those problems will be solved in due course

i believe that there are some negotiations taking place on it at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will be grateful to my noble friend for raising the matter of the royal air forces requirement for a new basic trainer <e> <s> before explaining our approach to meeting this requirement i should first like to give some background <e> <s> after gaining initial flying experience the royal air force students undertake a period of training on the jet provost and then specialise on a type of aircraft relevant to their anticipated future employment <e> <s> pilots destined for fast jet combat aircraft progress from the jet provost to the hawk another very successful aircraft with an increasing number of armed services overseas the latest of which is the united states navy <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may briefly reply to the noble lord first on the question of the identification parade i understand that the <e>", "<cs> because that could only be the implication of my understanding at least of what the noble lord said <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be the case but the fact is that the conduct of the parade which i think is the important problem to which the noble lord has referred is in the hands of the uniformed inspector to whom i earlier referred <e> <s> i would not want to put in the mouth of the noble lord words that he did not intend to be there about the breath testing or if i misunderstood him i apologise <e> <s> the fact is that the operation of those machines is a task which requires training but it is none the less a routine one <e> <s> i believe that it is right that the officers should be permitted to carry out those functions under the provisions of the amendment as proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that compliance with whatever demands have been made on the south african government is for that government and not for the british government <e> <s> as i said in my main answer we very much deplore the fact that the statement was issued from the consulate premises or in effect from the consulate premises in durban which is not a proper use of those premises <e> <s> we hope that such use will stop forthwith <e>",

have on many occasions made clear our opposition to that matter <e> <s> the noble lord may be aware that the european community foreign ministers made a further declaration in that vein only a few weeks ago when they met in dublin <e> <s> i am afraid that the resolution of this very considerable problem and it is becoming a very considerable problem for our consulate in durban is the voluntary departure of these people <e> <s> we hope that that can be achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid the resolution of the problems to which the noble lord refers in many cases deep-seated is not to be found by seeking to take over diplomatic missions of other countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no such request has been made <e> <s> if it were to be made it would of course be considered on it merits <e>", "<cs> my lords we have made our views known to the south african government very clearly indeed but what we are not prepared to do is intervene in the legal processes of

service requirements <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for being a bit slow on my feet <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is consequential <e> <s> it is a government amendment <e> <s> i think it was called in the name of the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones which was slightly off-putting <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to your lordships that i was not quicker <e> <s> this is a government amendment <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords the present number of diplomatic staff in london enjoying full diplomatic immunity is <e> <s> that does not include dependent family members forming a part of the immune persons household <e> <s> i think that my right honourable friend the foreign and commonwealth secretary gave further details when he addressed the foreign affairs committee <e> <s> no i am mistaken it was my noble friend the minister of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs lady young when she addressed the foreign and commonwealth affairs committee on th july last <e> <s> i wonder whether my noble friend will allow me to send him some details of that <e>", "<cs> yes my lords it is the case that recently the permanent under-secretary at the foreign and commonwealth office wrote to heads of missions along the lines that the noble lord has mentioned <e> <s> i do not think that we expected any formal response to that communication except perhaps more scrupulous observance of our laws <e>", "<cs> my lords until recently records were kept only in individual personal files and there was no central record <e> <s> however a recent survey of records at overseas posts has revealed that in the last years as it happens nine diplomatic service officers escaped prosecution for offences other than minor traffic violations such as parking offences by virtue of their immunity <e>", "<cs> my lords that must be self-evident from the answers which i have given <e> <s> it does i suppose indicate what a high standard of behaviour we have come to expect and get from our diplomatic officers serving overseas but it may also be a reflection of the very considerable size of the diplomatic community in london <e>", "<cs> my lords at the outset let me hasten to associate myself with the words of praise which my noble friend directed towards the workforce of the royal ordnance factories <e> <s> i perfectly understand my noble friends desire that parliament should be kept aware of what is happening with regard to the privatisation of the new royal ordnance company <e> <s> my noble friend moved an amendment on report which would have required any disposal of shares in the new company to be authorised by an affirmative resolution of both houses of parliament <e> <s> i explained then that such a requirement would not be practicable since the details of a flotation could not be finally fixed until a very short time before the offer for sale and the date of the offer for sale would be variable since it would depend on many factors <e> <s> on the other hand any debate which took place well in advance of a flotation would be lacking those details which parliament would undoubtedly wish to have <e> <s> i said that the government would announce their intention before privatisation took place and we would do this as close as possible to the event <e> <s> any noble lord who wished to ask questions arising out of such a statement would of course be free to do so <e> <s> it seems to me that this would be much the best way of handling the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords if i have your lordships permission to speak again i would say that all that is fairly conjectural <e> <s> we do not know how long the secretary of state will be in the position under which the amendment would require him to make such a report <e> <s> indeed as i said earlier it is not clear from the amendment how long my noble friend had in mind <e> <s> i believe that the process of the company making its own report in a form with which we are now very familiar is the right way in which to proceed with this matter and i hope that my noble friend will now think so too <e>", "<cs> my lords if i still have your lordships permission to speak for a third time on this matter i must say that i could not answer my noble friends question without taking some advice but i have a feeling that he may have put his finger on another difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords we have addressed the question of the publication of these documents on a number of occasions during the passage of this bill <e> <s> i must say again that the government are quite prepared to lay the first scheme before parliament by vesting day and to publish any memorandum of understanding no later than vesting day should it be ready by then and i hope it will be <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will recall that we amended this clause in committee to take out of the bill a provision that the act should come into force two months after royal assent <e> <s> i must say that i find it disappointing that the noble lord having accepted that amendment in committee now seeks to replace the two-month delay with a six-month delay <e> <s> the governments position remains now as it was at committee stage and was explained to your lordships at that time <e> <s> we are anxious that vesting day should occur as soon as possible after this bill receives royal assent <e> <s> obviously it cannot take place before the act comes into force and therefore we sought successfully to amend the bill to allow vesting day to take place as soon as the act is passed <e> <s> we cannot accept a substitution of a six-month delay for the two-month delay which we have already removed from the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may have permission to speak again may i answer the noble lord in this way <e> <s> first the question of when we shall reach agreement on these matters is not wholly in the hands of government because we are discussing these matters with other people <e> <s> the noble lord should address his questions to those other people for example the trade unions who are also involved in the discussion <e> <s> but as i said during my earlier remarks it is not in any event absolutely necessary that all of these matters are precisely agreed before vesting day <e> <s> i very much hope that they will be and most of them i believe will be <e> <s> i have already assured your lordships about the sort of documents that we shall be able to make available at that time <e> <s> but i think that there is an important argument to put before your lordships which i have already done namely that if we keep moving the deadline nothing will ever be agreed <e> <s> i hope therefore that the noble lord will see the force of that <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i shall now repeat in the form of a statement an answer to a private notice question now being given in another place by my honourable friend the minister of state at the foreign and commonwealth office about the situation in ethiopia <e> <s> the answer is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to both noble lords whose observations have underlined the seriousness of this situation which the government wholly endorse <e> <s> i think the question of distribution is an important one <e> <s> that is why we have taken the steps we have and why too we tend to deal with the voluntary agencies already in place in ethiopia which of course already have some facilities at their disposal for the distribution purposes to which i have referred <e>", "<cs> my lords we have already provided some trucks to ethiopia for this purpose but of course if we were to go so far as my noble friend suggests that would cost enormous sums of money and i am not certain that that would be the best use of the resources available <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly have not despaired of doing more in the way of direct food aid to which the noble lord has referred <e> <s> as i said we are considering with our european community partners what more can be done <e> <s> i understand that there are still some resources available within the communitys aid budget for emergency aid and we shall be doing our best to persuade our partners that they should go where they are most needed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of a number of steps that are being taken within some of the united nations agencies in this particular matter for example the united nations development programme which includes unicef <e> <s> i do not have information about the particular programme to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> if there is any more information that i can find i shall write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so with respect that question goes a little wide of the statement that i have repeated to your lordships <e> <s> the fact remains that we are dealing with a particularly special situation in this case and i do not think we want to be thinking in some high-flying economic terms <e> <s> what we have to do is to get the food and the distribution arrangements into place in this country just as soon as we can <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have explained during earlier stages of this bill the government believe that tupe provides for the transfer of the existing terms and conditions of employment to the new company save for the small changes necessary having regard to the fact that the employees will be transferring from employment under the crown to employment under the new companies act company <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope i made clear during our discussions on this amendment at the earlier stage that the flexibility permitted by schedule of this bill to retain the mod police at some or all rof sites was recognised as a sensible and practical policy by both sides when this was discussed in the other place <e> <s> the government will continue to monitor security arrangements at rof locations with the same stringency as hitherto in the light of threat assessments and changing circumstances <e> <s> we firmly believe that this flexibility is necessary so that the response will suitably match the threat at each site <e> <s> we have of course recognised that some royal ordnance factories present a more attractive target for terrorists than others and we have not proposed to remove the mdp from those sites <e> <s> but at those sites where we do not need to rely on the full police powers of the mdp which are quite extensive then it only makes common sense to have the ability to withdraw them <e> <s> equally changes are not going to happen overnight <e> <s> we will be reviewing most carefully the appropriate security arrangements at each site including any necessary improvements in physical security and only then will decisions be taken <e> <s> such a review will of course involve consultation with all the relevant parties <e>", "<cs> my lords if i have leave to speak again i have to say that i think that the observations from the noble baroness go a little wide of the point we are now considering which is whether or not the ministry of defence police should remain completely and in perpetuity at the royal ordnance factory sites <e> <s> i think that the site to which she referred was not such a site if i heard her correctly <e> <s> the question of licensing security firms for the purposes that the noble baroness had in mind is a little different from the matters that we have under consideration here <e> <s> the government have made their views plain on how we see the future of these matters and i hope we can leave it to rest at that <e>", "<cs> my lords i now beg to move that this bill do now pass <e> <s> a number of issues have been raised during the discussions that we have had on the bill and i am grateful to noble lords in particular noble lords opposite for the constructive proposals that they have brought forward even if i have not felt able to agree with them <e> <s> i hope i have demonstrated during our debates that the bill ensures that the present terms and conditions of service of the workforce a matter which has been very much in the minds of noble lords opposite will broadly be preserved by the application of tupe <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that i need to lengthen this discussion further <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble lord lord diamond thinks that we have been unduly rushing matters <e> <s> the noble lord will recall that as i said earlier we originally hoped that vesting day would be some time in october <e> <s> it is now clear that we shall not achieve that largely because we have not been rushing this measure through your lordships house <e> <s> if we had rushed we would have sought to get the measure through parliament before the summer recess and would no doubt then have achieved vesting day as originally intended <e> <s> but we did not seek to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that our aid as a percentage of gnp has fallen since but i think the figure for that year per cent <e> <s> which the noble lord refered to was exceptionally high for reasons unrelated to the actual level of expenditure <e> <s> the reason is that the oecd count our aid to the world bank when we deposit notes at the bank of england and not when the world bank actually spends the money <e> <s> this causes year to year fluctuations in our measured performance <e> <s> we have consistently exceeded the per cent <e> <s> un target with a total of official and private flows <e> <s> in the amount was per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly think that our aid budget ought to be determined in accordance with the funds that we have available to support it and indeed in accordance with the effect to which those funds are put as my noble friend says <e> <s> as to the existence of a target although we have had to make the observations which we have about reaching that target which incidentally were made by our predecessors in exactly the same way it does perhaps serve a useful purpose with some of the more laggardly nations <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so i think that the noble lord oversimplifies these matters <e> <s> it is possible to suggest although it is by no means proven that money spent overseas or granted overseas for aid purposes finds its way back to our economy but i hope the noble lord will not overlook the fact that that money in fact came from the british taxpayer in the first place and therefore has been taken out of the economy anyway <e>", "<cs> my lords no i do not think the moral standards of today are any lower than the moral standards of other times <e> <s> but i do believe that we must determine our aid budget in accordance with the resources that we can make available from the governments resources generally <e> <s> i do not think we have done at all badly with regard to aid <e> <s> the figure for the last couple of years has shown a modest increase and i hope very much that we shall be able to continue that although i could not guarantee it <e>", "<cs> my lords the figure for which the noble lord has asked me and the one which i have given is as the noble lord knows the percentage of gnp constituted by official development assistance <e> <s> we in this country as it happens largely for historical reasons actually provide very substantial sums for similar purposes from private sources and that is the figure to which i also referred a little later in my answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not responsible for what countries on the continent of europe do but i can say that our predecessors failed to have regard to the level of our resources and look at the mess that they got us into <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the disadvantages of the previous adminstration would take me rather longer to recite than question time allows <e>", "<cs> my lords it is too early for the government to be able to reach a conclusion on this matter <e> <s> we are carefully studying the situation <e> <s> as the noble lord will be well aware and as he has already indicated the implications are far reaching <e> <s> indeed the united states programme is a long-term one and is limited to research <e> <s> decisions on whether or not to deploy defences against ballistic missiles are several years away <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord that is another matter but speaking from memory i recall that that is something which the united states has advanced outside the context of nato <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as contacts go they are continuing on an almost regular basis <e> <s> a number of communications in both directions have taken place <e> <s> with regard to cost i am afraid that it is too early to make an estimate of what would be the cost but i am certain that it would be very substantial <e> <s> so far as the implications for the abm treaty are concerned neither side has signalled any intention of breaking the abm treaty <e> <s> the government have <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall certainly want to take notice of all the important views that have been expressed on these matters including the ones referred to by the noble and gallant lord as well as indeed those of the noble and gallant lord himself <e>", "<cs> my lords it is really not the case that the united states government have proceeded without consultation in this matter <e> <s> as i said in the main reply consultations are now continuing most fruitfully <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no question of taking any decisions about procurement in this matter at this time <e> <s> indeed the kind of sums of money which have so far been spent on abm defence are nowhere near the sort of figures to which the noble lord has referred <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no question of arriving at a conclusion on these matters overnight any more than there is of spending overnight the kind of sums of money to which the noble lord has referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that your lordships will forgive me if i intervene now to repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable and learned friend the foreign and commonwealth secretary <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord will allow me first to answer the noble lord lord cledwyn and the noble lord lord gladwyn <e> <s> on the question of gibraltar i do not think i have very much more to add on that matter than the answers that i gave in the house the other day on a similar question <e> <s> we certainly continue to regard it as inconceivable that the restrictions presently in force particularly on the land border can remain in place after spain joins the community <e> <s> the spaniards are <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a happy thought but the matter to which foreign affairs ministers addressed their attention at the recent council was the distribution of butter <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lord has put his finger upon one of the most important issues at present facing the european community <e> <s> the views of the british government on this matter have never been in any doubt <e> <s> nevertheless we wish to be constructive and i shall ascertain what additional information i can make available to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree for a moment that the lisbon agreement is a dead duck <e> <s> as my noble friend may recall the lisbon agreement was signed in <e> <s> the british government have stood ready to implement that agreement ever since <e> <s> the spaniards have from time to time asked for clarification of certain aspects of the agreement which we have endeavoured to provide <e> <s> they have confirmed that they hope to be able to implement the agreement in due course <e> <s> but the governments view on the matter is very clear and i hope that it will be in the mind of my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend asked me to tell him the areas upon which agreement has not yet been reached <e> <s> i have to say that on the matters to which i have referred final agreement has not yet been reached <e> <s> i have reported progress to your lordships but not final agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords although this matter was not specifically discussed at the council of foreign ministers to which i referred i understand that my right honourable friend the foreign and commonwealth secretary has decided that we should make a further major contribution by directing that the balance of our national food aid allocated for this <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to tell my noble friend that this is not a matter for the european community <e> <s> spain is not preventing access to gibraltar airport although as the noble lord is well aware difficulties arise over the spanish prohibited area which lies adjacent to it <e> <s> as i have already said this is not a matter which lies within the competence of the european community but it is one upon which the spanish government are in no doubt as to our views <e> <s> my noble friend wrote to me immediately following our exchange the other day <e> <s> i have it in mind to reply at some length to my noble friend as soon as i can <e>", "<cs> my lords it is for the commission to initiate action <e> <s> nevertheless i do not believe we can do better than to create an example which we hope others will follow <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure to which great new dawn the noble lord is referring <e> <s> i recall quite a number of those during the course of the life of the european community <e> <s> progress has certainly been made on this matter and we hope for a successful conclusion in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords i can do no better than to repeat the words which i used the other day not verbatim but in essence when we discussed this matter <e> <s> the government very much support the principle of spanish and portuguese accession to the european community <e> <s> we are working to negotiate our way through the inevitable difficulties which are created by that proposal <e> <s> we have passed quite a number of the difficulties and have solved some of them <e> <s> we are now working to resolve the remainder <e> <s> we still believe that it is desirable and probable that the european community will be enlarged by the addition of spain and portugal in january <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly take note of what the noble lord says but i have announced today an additional bilateral contribution to the problems of drought and famine in ethiopia <e> <s> it is difficult to imagine setting a better example than that <e>", "<cs> my lords there will be some additional information in the documents which are to be incorporated in the <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be very unwise of me to speculate at all upon who laid that mine but i can confirm that it was not the royal navy <e>", "<cs> my lords mostly her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to come absolutely clean and say that i was not aware of the conference concerned but i shall find out and let the noble lord know the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may be reassured to know that as regards mine-clearing vessels generally we have ton class vessels eight hunt class vessels and two river class vessels currently in service and in addition the single role minesweepers are on order <e>", "<cs> my lords we are certainly wondering which country it is which could have laid the mine but we would have to begin the inquiries on the basis of some evidence and so far we have none that is of any consequence <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i should like to repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the foreign and commonwealth secretary about developments during the recess in the negotiations between the british and chinese governments on the future of hong kong <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for being a little slow to rise to my feet <e> <s> i very much appreciate the reception which the noble and learned lord and the noble lord have given to this statement <e> <s> the chinese government have certainly accepted the position which i outlined in the statement about the status of the agreement which we have reached <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord lord mayhew for not answering the point that he put to me about the assessment procedure and what may happen to the records that are prepared there <e> <s> i can see no reason why the records need to be kept longer than is necessary for the assessment office to form its views <e> <s> we hope that we shall get its report by the end of november <e> <s> if i am wrong about that perhaps i may be allowed to communicate with the noble lord <e> <s> but as i say i am not aware of any plans other than the ones to which i have referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> i entirely agree with him that the way forward now is to secure the consent and confidence of the people of hong kong <e> <s> i believe that that can be reflected through the machinery of the joint liaison group which is to be set up under the agreement <e> <s> we shall certainly ensure that hong kong is appropriately represented on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend will not ask me for a precise recitation of the parliamentary procedures which are followed in china <e> <s> i am bound to say that i should need to pause and reflect a while before offering any such thing <e>", "<cs> my lords brief and short they may be but i suspect that they are effective as well <e> <s> to provide my noble friend with a serious answer to his important question the government are satisfied that the chinese government will be in a position to deliver the basic law as they have undertaken to do in this agreement <e> <s> it is of course some years off as my noble friend rightly says but the principles which are to be set out in that basic law are enunciated in the draft agreement which the chinese government have initialled <e> <s> it is for that reason that the government have complete confidence in them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked how the people of hong kong could be involved in this matter <e> <s> i think i can principally point to the assessment process on which we have embarked <e> <s> no less than two million copies of the white paper have been distributed in hong kong most of them i believe in chinese <e> <s> happily this one is not <e> <s> therefore the people of hong kong most of whom speak chinese will be able to determine what is proposed and express their views upon it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is clear from the agreement that the question of the defence of hong <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i think his remarks underline what i said earlier that there are some advantages to both sides in the agreement that has been reached <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that observation <e> <s> it is indeed a great achievement for british diplomacy <e> <s> i fancy it is almost as great an achievement as the one four years ago in which my noble friend played such a distinguished part <e>", "<cs> my lords the other place has given as its reason for disagreeing with this amendment that <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a long debate on these and related matters <e> <s> perhaps i could say in parenthesis that the articles of association in which i know the noble lord lord stoddart is <e>", "<cs> my lords i hasten to give my noble friend the assurance for which he asks <e> <s> of course there is no constitutional impropriety in this bill <e> <s> the bill has now passed effectively through both houses save for the small remaining matter we are discussing today <e> <s> therefore i hope that in due course it will become the law of the land <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i should now like to repeat a statement being made in the other place by my right honourable friend the minister for overseas development about famine relief for ethiopia <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to both noble lords <e> <s> i can confirm to the noble lord lord oram that some initial problems in connection with the aircraft have been overcome and that our offer has been gratefully accepted <e> <s> as for the voluntary agencies i wholly agree with the noble lord lord oram that they play an invaluable role in situations of this sort <e> <s> of course they often have access to these places and to information to a much greater extent than governments <e> <s> that is why we support them as much as we can whenever we can <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall certainly do our best to assist in situations like those to which my noble friend refers <e> <s> that is why my right honourable friend said in his earlier statement last week that the million for spending on famine relief would be available in ethiopia and indeed in other african countries although i must say that in present circumstances i anticipate that the lions share will go to ethiopia <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble baroness is right <e> <s> the government were very pleased to be able to assist the international committee of the red cross in the way that we did <e> <s> we have provided <e>", "<cs> my lords there are really two separate aspects to the present problem <e> <s> the first is to ensure that there are sufficient supplies of food in particular available in or near ethiopia <e> <s> the second is to distribute those supplies within that country <e> <s> frankly the quantities of grain either available or shortly to arrive in ethiopia are quite considerable <e> <s> the principal problem now i think is to ensure effective distribution throughout that country <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend has probably put his finger on the essence of this problem <e> <s> the long-term solution is certainly i think in the direction that my noble friend points <e> <s> we are therefore working vigorously with the agencies concerned to try to see that that can happen <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is i think quite right to point to the long-term nature of the problem <e> <s> the problems arise from the difficult <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i would need to reflect a little on the particular climatic implications of the noble earls question <e> <s> but the fact of the matter as the noble earl rightly says is that there has been a drought situation emerging in ethiopia for years at least which i imagine goes back at least as far as the time when the noble earl was concerned with these things <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the noble lords response to the rapid arrangements that we have been able to make in this matter <e> <s> perhaps it is worth saying that i think we are the first western government to announce precisely what we are doing in this tragic situation although other governments i believe are close behind us <e> <s> as to the long-term solution if i may say so so much in the minds of your lordships at this moment i certainly agree that we need to be looking to create an effective programme probably through the international agencies for the solution of this problem in the long-term and my right honourable friend will be thinking very hard about that <e>", "<cs> my lords as i think every noble lord has rightly and properly said we are most grateful to the noble baroness lady burton for giving us this early opportunity of considering the recent white paper on airline competition policy <e> <s> this debate has illustrated the wide interest in the question and dare i say the widely differing views held about it <e> <s> ever since the caa published its report in july much some might say too much of the public discussion has focussed on the sensitive issue of route transfers <e> <s> the white paper rejected the idea of transfers and i shall deal with them later <e> <s> but it is important to remember that the authoritys proposals for transfers where never an end in themselves <e> <s> they were only the means to an end <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be making a reference at least to that later <e> <s> but the noble lord knows i am sure the importance that the government have always attached to that matter as indeed have all previous governments <e> <s> nothing in our policy must be taken as in any way departing from that particular position <e> <s> of course that is a matter for the civil aviation authority and it is a matter that they take with the utmost seriousness <e>", "<cs> my lords the position is i am speaking from memory on these matters and my noble friend will forgive me therefore if i do not get it quite right that the tickets were sold or should have been sold subject to the condition that the fare had not yet been approved <e> <s> the fact is therefore that those who seek to travel on those tickets will have to surrender them for new tickets and pay the additional element of the fare that is now required <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to say that that is the case <e> <s> my own view and i am speaking personally here is that the tickets should really not have been sold when there was some doubt as to whether the fare would be authorised because that must have been clear to the airlines when they chose to sell the tickets at the lower fare for which they had not received approval <e> <s> i hope your lordships will allow me to emphasise that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i can understand the concern which my noble friend expresses in this matter and i am bound to say that i share that concern but i have to say that the position is as i have described it <e> <s> i very much regret that position but it was not a position of the governments making <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asks me to comment on the legal implications of a hypothetical situation <e> <s> i hope he will forgive me if i do not do that <e> <s> but naturally anything that can be done to relieve the distress of the would-be-travellers is something which i would welcome provided that it fell within the ambit of the regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to say that the atm limit will be imposed at that level when terminal comes into use next year <e> <s> that would be honouring previous undertakings and not to impose it would certainly reopen the basis of the stansted and terminal inquiries <e> <s> but my right honourable friend has also said that he may be able to review the limit once we have experienced it in operation <e> <s> with regard to the second runway at gatwick i doubt whether i have anything much to add to what i have said in the past on that matter on a large number of occasions <e> <s> suffice it to say that the governments position has not changed <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked a question on that yesterday and received what i consider was a very effectively delivered reply from my noble friend lord brabazon <e> <s> but i think that the noble lord is in something of a misunderstanding over all this because in almost every case british airways have bought their aeroplanes i think this is the point he was making on a commercial basis the main exception to that being of course the concorde purchase which was subsequently written-off as the noble lord will know <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of any such request for taxpayers money to wipe out the loan as the noble lord says <e> <s> we are still thinking about the terms of the british airways flotation and i really cannot add to what my noble friend had to say on this matter yesterday <e>", "<cs> my lords we understand that the european air navigation planning groups <e>", "<cs> my lords no that is not so <e> <s> i am happy to be able to say that a number of improvements along the lines proposed by the planning group are being brought into effect straightaway <e> <s> for example a dublin-london route has been established a

considerations which the noble lord mentioned are relevant in this case and will be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords that will of course be a very important consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i

doubt about the britishness of british aerospace shorts westlands or hunting aircraft which are the companies concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that when we come to make and announce a decision on this matter there will be intense parliamentary interest in what we have to say and i am also certain that we shall be called upon to justify our decision in the most detailed terms <e> <s> i certainly believe that that would be right <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that it is part of the purpose of the budget of the ministry of defence that it should be used for social purposes in any part of the united kingdom no matter how desirable those social purposes might be <e> <s> having said that we shall of course take into account the considerations that the noble lord has put to us but i do not think that they could be paramount considerations <e>", "<cs> my lords the choice of designers was a matter for the commercial judgment of british airways management <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the initial choice of the american firm as design consultants was carried out by a competitive process and for that reason i do not think i would wish to criticise british airways in the way that the noble lord suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will be aware we are approaching the moment when british airways will we hope be passed into private hands <e> <s> for that reason my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport has made it clear to british airways that they should be operating on a proper commercial basis <e> <s> that is what they are doing and i decline to criticise them for that <e>", "<cs> my lords i imagine that any such proposals would fail the competitive process <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that history tends to prove the noble lady wrong <e> <s> the fact is that british airways like all major international airlines operates in an international environment and has to compete in the international market place and must therefore make its arrangements accordingly <e>", "<cs> not at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not immediately rise to the bait offered by the noble lord lord oram but will begin by saying how grateful i am to the noble lord lord walston for giving us the opportunity to debate this important matter and hence an opportunity for me to give a response to it <e>", "<cs> my lords unfortunately the tangle of red tape to which my noble friend refers is the labyrinthine corridors of scottish law which we are doing our best to negotiate <e>", "<cs> my lords yes it is indeed the case that the scottish people generally are very receptive of defence facilities in their particular part of the country <e> <s> with regard to this road there is now a by-pass which i am sure will overcome any modest inconvenience that might be caused by closing this road when and if we are able to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend no doubt has a point but happily as far as wittering is concerned they have the benefit of english law <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to say that the brief i have from the commander of raf leuchars does not cover that point <e>", "<cs> my lords it must be that this particular clause escaped the attention to those to whom the noble lord refers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that piece of information <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if the noble lord thinks that because it is not the case <e> <s> we can <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will be aware the parliamentary procedure that would be required would be considerably longer than half a day <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that the workers will have any reason to believe that the new arrangements are in any way detrimental to them <e> <s> perhaps i could say in parenthesis that some of the redundancies that were originally foreshadowed at two of the royal ordnance factories namely birtley and bishopton will not now be as serious as was at first feared fewer jobs are likely to be lost at birtley as a result of a recent order for armour piercing fin stabilised discarding sabot shot <e> <s> also at bishopton there will be a saving in the number of redundancies of against the figures originally envisaged again because of an improved workload <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not think that would have been the right course of action <e> <s> of course this has no relation to the public sale of shares in royal ordnance plc <e> <s> what we are talking about is the transfer of these assets to a company which will in the first instance be wholly owned by my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall of course reveal as much detail as we can in the scheme which i have referred to which will be laid before the house no later than vesting day <e> <s> but there are elements of this which impinge upon the commerical relevance to the company concerned <e> <s> for example if the other commercial competitors with royal ordnance factories knew the precise value of certain assets and thus the amount to be ascribed to their costs in relation to the servicing of those assets that would be a piece of commercial information which the opposition would no doubt find very useful <e>", "<cs> my lords none has as yet been invited to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure what the noble lord is referring to <e> <s> i have just announced a reduced number of redundancies not an increase <e> <s> the level of employment in the royal ordnance factories is not wholly in the gift of the government <e> <s> it depends on the commercial success of the royal ordnance factories and when they eventually move into the private sector they will be in a much better position to achieve that <e>", "<cs> my lords i have just announced a reduction in the number of redundancies which are anticipated at birtley but none the less the continued maintenance of a particular level of employment at that factory in the royal ordnance system or at any other is dependent upon their commercial success <e> <s> the ministry of defence is not a sort of national health service for the defence industries of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords we have not as yet announced any date for the privatisation of the royal ordnance factories <e> <s> the exercise that we are now <e>", "<cs> my lords of course these are important matters which the ministry of defence does indeed take into account but as i said in answer to another question the other day these are not the paramount considerations to which we have to have regard <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> the main thrust of these proposals is to enable the royal ordnance factories to compete more effectively in world markets for these products <e>", "<cs> my lords the valuation of the assets to be transferred will be agreed by the secretary of state with the management of the royal ordnance factories relying if need be on the advice of independent advisers <e>", "<cs> my lords yes they will subject to the usual constraints that exist with regard to any other defence contractor <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly aim to spread our purchases over the country as effectively as possible but in the end we have to have regard in the main anyway to the considerations of cost effectiveness as far as the defence budget is concerned and to ensure that we get the right product at the right price and made to the right specification <e>", "<cs> my lords our policy is to procure our defence equipment by competitive means wherever practicable and reasonable in order to get the right equipment for the armed forces and the best long-term value for money for the taxpayer <e> <s> the policy is applied pragmatically and equitably case by case considering carefully all the relevant factors including any possible consequences for the tenderers involved <e> <s> staff are working to clear guidelines on the implementation of this policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there are a number of points stemming from that supplementary question <e> <s> i was myself at british aerospace in manchester on friday of last week <e> <s> i am very well aware of the points which the noble lord puts to me and we are doing our best to proceed with this very complicated matter as quickly as we can <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that there is no dogmatic basis to the policy that we are following <e> <s> it is one of practical common sense <e> <s> i must say to him that of course if it was the case that in a particular product it was going to be more expensive through some competitive process then naturally we would not follow that course <e> <s> but all the evidence we have so far is that it is no such thing <e> <s> it produces better value for the taxpayer <e>", "<cs> my lords naturally we have to have regard to those considerations <e> <s> indeed it is those sort of considerations that have caused us to have to take some time over the matter which the noble lord lord sefton raised just a moment ago <e> <s> but of course it depends upon the nature of the task that we are asking the company to perform as to whether or not they are capable of carrying it out and naturally we have to satisfy ourselves that they are capable of doing so before we give the contract to them <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer in truth to the noble lords question is rather a long one which might go beyond the scope of question time <e> <s> but the government do see advantages from the policy we are now following and if the noble lord would like to have a private discussion with me i should be very happy to show him the way <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would like for example to table an unstarred question on this matter i should be very happy to give him a full reply <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the captain of the belgrano was not entitled to assume any such thing <e> <s> he should have referred to the warning issued by the british government on rd april and conveyed to the security council on th april <e> <s> it stated <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel certain that my noble friend is right and i hope that that observation will not be lost on those who think otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope and believe that the noble lord is right <e>", "<cs> my lords i look forward to that day with keen anticipation <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a bizarre interpretation of the words i have recorded if i may say so <e> <s> the operative sentences of course related to the threat which such vessels posed to united kingdom forces <e> <s> that was why the response was evoked which we offered <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords imagination grows more vivid by the day if i may say so <e>

"<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord on all three counts <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure which distortion the noble lord appears to have apprehended <e> <s> perhaps i may quote the second sentence of the same warning from which i quoted earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords the views of my right honourable friend the then foreign and commonwealth secretary or the attorney-general were not related to the threat which the argentine vessels posed to the united kingdom task force <e> <s> that was a matter which fell to be assessed by the commanders on the spot <e>", "<cs> my lords i am

to my noble friend lord mottistone on th december <e>", "<cs> my lords strangely my own memory has now deserted me too <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as i know there are no plans to offer commander wreford-brown a peerage <e>", "<cs> no my lords because all signal logs are destroyed under the authority of the defence council as described by my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords a board

disagree with my noble friend on all three counts <e>", "<cs> my lords no i am afraid that the noble lord is not correct <e> <s> the total cost of this project is still estimated to be around per cent <e> <s> of the defence budget as a whole over the period of its acquisition <e> <s> this amounts to about per cent <e> <s> of the procurement budget during the same time <e> <s> of course this is a comparatively small proportion of our total defence expenditure <e>", "<cs> indeed it does my lords <e> <s> if we were not to embark upon this programme we would some time early in the s be out of the independent nuclear deterrent business altogether <e>", "<cs> my lords the equivalent in conventional terms of the cost of the trident programme is four or five mechanised divisions <e> <s> having regard to the fact that the soviets already have a preponderance of i think or mechanised divisions on the central front that is not likely to make much difference <e>", "<cs> my lords may i invite noble lords to await the publication of the new estimate of costs early next year <e> <s> i do not think it will be anything like some of the absurd figures that i have seen in the press recently <e> <s> in any event as i was saying in answer to my noble friend it does represent very good value for money for deterrent purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i lost track of some of those supplementaries <e> <s> but my noble friend does underline some of the important advantages of this programme speaking as he does from an important position of experience in these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord starts from a mistaken premise <e> <s> this is an independent nuclear deterrent and can indeed if circumstances so demand be used independently <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble lord is that the purpose of our independent deterrent and indeed of the deterrent posture of the alliance as a whole is to enable us to ensure that if and only if the soviets or any other potential adversary should seek to attack us we are in a position to respond in a way that they would find unacceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that we should do what we can to improve our conventional forces posture but not at the expense of our nuclear forces <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the last part of my noble friends question no i am afraid that the correct position is not as my noble friend describes it <e> <s> the offset as my noble friend refers to it will be and was always intended to be the result of a competitive process <e> <s> it is up to british firms to compete effectively with their american competitors <e> <s> but it is of course necessary that they should be given the chance to do that <e> <s> and that is what we have arranged <e>", "<cs> my lords the suggestion which my noble friend reports is of course without foundation <e> <s> nonetheless i have recently visited the barracks at ballymena and met local people and naturally all these points of view will be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend repeats a point of view which has been put to me very forcibly <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord underlines the diversity of view on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the use of firearms by servicemen is governed by rules of engagement designed to ensure that shots are fired only as a last resort in accordance as i said earlier with the law of the land and the doctrine of minimum force necessary to protect life and vital installations <e> <s> may i add that peaceful demonstrators who are behaving in a responsible and lawful manner have nothing to fear <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree with my noble friend <e> <s> that is why we have the rules of engagement to which i have referred <e>", "<cs> my lords the article

classified and i am afraid that the noble lord is not authorised to receive that information <e>", "<cs> my lords i think one ought to resist the temptation to imagine that there is some simple panacea to these problems which could produce a simple straightforward solution overnight <e> <s> as president reagan said recently <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is of course quite right <e> <s> that is why we attach such importance to the mbfr talks as they are called which are presently going on in vienna <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the difficulty is that the history of these matters is littered with occasions when we have had to be disappointed to put it no higher with the actions of the other side as related to their assurances <e> <s> for that reason i am convinced that verification is a crucial part of whatever arms control agreements we can reach and that is why we support the search for effective measures in that area <e>", "<cs> my lords i think my noble friend

"<cs> my lords i wish that i had the faith of the noble lord in these matters but i do not believe any useful purpose would be served by arms control agreements which one side or another can flout at their will <e>", "<cs> my lords if i can grasp the essence of the noble lords supplementary question i certainly agree that we ought to be seeking balanced and verifiable methods of arms control <e>

is why my right honourable friend thought it right to make another statement and he will be doing so very shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble lord is quite mistaken in that view

are not likely to make much difference <e>", "<cs> no my lords that is not true <e> <s> the period of acquisition remains as it always has been <e> <s> i refer my noble friend to the speech which my right honourable friend made at the party conference last year in which he set out the time-scale involved <e>", "<cs> my lords there are of course a number of contracts involved in the trident procurement process but they are generally speaking fixed price contracts <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the answer that i gave does coincide with what has been said before <e> <s> there has been no change in the acquisition period <e> <s> i repeat that i invite the noble lord to refer to earlier remarks on the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords the contracts themselves are not increasing <e> <s> what is changing of course is the dollar-pound exchange rate <e> <s> about per cent <e> <s> of the contracts are set in dollars <e> <s> the number of dollars is remaining the same the number of pounds necessary to acquire those dollars is changing <e>", "<cs> my lords a large percentage of the project overall is being carried out in the united kingdom something like half overall including of course the submarines themselves <e> <s> indeed united kingdom firms are being given the chance to tender for some of the other work as well <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is referring to service officers in the plural <e> <s> as far as i know there is only one service officer making such submissions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords <e> <s> as for the questions put to me by the noble lord lord graham i can tell him that the social considerations if i may call them that while not paramount certainly loomed pretty large in our considerations of this particular contract or these two contracts as they now are <e> <s> i can confirm that we have certainly cut no corners in reaching the specification and the contractual terms of these two ships <e> <s> that would certainly be a reprehensible action to take and we of course would have none of that <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend puts his finger on the principal point that we have sought to correct in seeking the so-called tauter terms in our contractual arrangements that is to get punctual delivery at the time at the price and to the specification stipulated in the contract <e> <s> there is a small sum involved in going to two separate yards rather than in placing the order for both ships at one yard <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend will allow me to write to him with the figure <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that intervention <e> <s> the efforts of the moderate elements in the workforce at cammell laird have indeed resulted in the placing of this order <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that it remains the governments policy to provide a fleet of about destroyers and frigates as the noble lord knows <e> <s> the orders that we have announced today which we have foreshadowed for next year will contribute to that fleet and there will be more frigates and destroyers ordered in the future <e>", "<cs> i see no reason why they should be my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the most reverend primate is right <e> <s> we see the ceremonies that we plan to organise as being in the nature of a thanksgiving for the sacrifice that was offered during the world war and also for the nearly years of peace which have followed <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with the noble and learned lord that we should not lose sight of the fact that there was the very considerable conflict in that part of the world at the same time <e> <s> i think that we rather anticipate that these ceremonies should take into account the whole world war rather than two separate aspects of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord is right <e> <s> we most certainly agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the th anniversary of the ending of the second world war is an important occasion and ought to be recognised in an appropriate way <e>", "<cs> my lords the rules of engagement issued to servicemen do not themselves constitute legal authorisation <e> <s> they give guidance on the use of force based upon and consistent with the requirements of the law including in england and wales section of the criminal law act <e>", "<cs> my lords the rules of engagement are of course confidential so the noble lord cannot be familiar with them <e> <s> as i said on the earlier occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only again remind the noble lord of the words i used on the earlier occasion when we discussed this matter that is that the rules of engagement permit the use of firearms only when life or vital national interests are threatened <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am not aware of any distinction <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of whether or not protesters are liable to be shot as the noble lord puts it depends essentially in fact precisely upon what they are doing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to tell the noble lord that i have not heard his question <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that was the rate applying at the end of june last year <e> <s> it has been the historical fact that we have always published the revised costings based on the rate at the end of june of the previous year <e> <s> there was nothing unusual about that <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is right to point to the effect of resolution <e> <s> that resolution also refers to the wishes of the lebanese government and we regard their wishes as paramount in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the government certainly made their views about the israeli entry into the lebanon clear at the time <e> <s> we were very pleased to hear the announcement from the israeli cabinet on i think the th january that they intended to withdraw completely <e> <s> i understand that the first phase is expected to be complete around th february <e> <s> but of course there is already a united nations force in lebanon and we hope that they can be assisted to discharge their mandate <e>", "<cs> my lords i must emphasise that the responsibility for security in areas of lebanon to be vacated by israel rests with the lebanese army and the <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that the united nations force in lebanon has achieved important successes during the time it has been there but i think it would have been able to achieve more had it been allowed to extend its area of operations <e> <s> however that is a matter for the lebanese government and not for the british government <e>", "<cs> my lords we should certainly want to agree to any proposal that contributed to additional security and peace in the area in question <e> <s> we in fact provide important support for the united nations force to which i have already referred <e> <s> i do not think i can go further than that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords for their response to my statement <e> <s> i am sorry that the statement did not please the noble lord lord graham <e> <s> in conducting this operation we were determined to ensure that we avoided some of the confrontational scenes that we have seen elsewhere in this country in recent months and years <e> <s> i am happy to say that that has been achieved <e> <s> the temporary fence that we have constructed has now been virtually completed without the confrontation that we have seen for example at greenham common in recent months <e> <s> i do not therefore agree with the remarks of the noble lord lord graham that we have conducted some form of overkill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to hear from the noble lord that the cnd has no plans for any unlawful activity <e> <s> that would hardly square with some of the things that it has been doing in the past <e> <s> indeed the very presence of members of the cnd if that is who they were at the so-called peace camp at molesworth was in itself unlawful because they were trespassing on ministry of defence land <e> <s> however the noble lord perhaps regards that as of no account <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord for not answering that question <e> <s> the cost of the materials at any event for constructing the fence around molesworth is about million <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord disagrees with that assertion but it is unhappily the case <e> <s> i am happy to hear that they intend to be peaceful <e> <s> however if it was they who were at greenham common in recent months they hardly lived up to that aspiration <e> <s> as for being lawful a number of breaches of the law have occurred at greenham common recently not only breaches of the civil law of trespass but also breaches of the criminal law <e> <s> i hope that we shall see an end to that <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the numbers of the civilian police who were involved <e> <s> that is of course a matter for the local police <e> <s> we left it to them to provide whatever forces were necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness will forgive me for interrupting her most interesting speech i would point out that she was confusing for a moment the civil aviation authority and the british airports authority <e> <s> i think she is referring to the british airports authority which is indeed run on commercial lines <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not mistaken when i said earlier this afternoon that i was anticipating a debate that would reflect the deep knowledge and interest in airports policy and the aviation industry that reside in your lordships house <e> <s> many different views have been cogently expressed not least by the noble lord lord chapple whose maiden speech was so much appreciated <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not given the noble lord any such undertaking so far as your lordships house is concerned <e> <s> as regards the position of another place that again is not a matter for me and i would invite the noble lord to study the words of my honourable friend when he gave that undertaking recently <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not in a position to give any assurances about debates in another place and indeed ministers in the other place would not wish to give assurances about debates in your lordships house <e> <s> the machinery for establishing the timetable of debates in another place is a different machinery from that whch establishes debates in your lordships house <e> <s> i hope the noble baroness will accept that the undertaking i have given to draw this matter to the attention of the usual channels is as far as i can go this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly take note of what my noble friend says on that matter <e> <s> but of course my noble friend will understand that i have to be very carefully about what i say for fear of anticipating anything that my right honourable and honourable friends may wish to decide <e>", "<cs> my lords these reductions have been achieved by a combination of improving efficiency privatisation contracting out and dropping or curtailing functions <e>", "<cs> my lords all the people i have referred to were and so far as i know continue to be classified as civilians although it is true to say that some of the personnel involved are now working for other organisations doing the same work <e>", "<cs> my lords the total number of civilians remaining on nd january which was the second date i gave in the original answer including locally engaged civilians overseas was <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the select committee on defence of another place and the public accounts committee already have the power to examine the trident programme including its costs and both have done so recently <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord takes that view <e> <s> needless to say i profoundly disagree with him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble lord is mistaken in imagining that this will have some dramatic effect upon our conventional capability because the cost in comparative terms is apparently fairly small <e> <s> as i ventured to indicate the other day when we discussed this matter all we could actually acquire for this sum of money is for example a very small number of armoured divisions which in comparison with the preponderance which already exists on the central front would hardly make any difference <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not think that is true at all <e> <s> it is not necessarily the case that the cost of trident is going to increase as the noble lord suggests <e> <s> the noble lord lord boston asked me for an accurate prediction of the cost <e> <s> if the noble lord can give me a precise indication of what the exchange rate will be in five or six years time i shall be happy to do that <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> but the bulk of the expenditure is not being met at the moment <e> <s> the bulk of the expenditure will not be met for some years yet <e> <s> if the noble lord can tell me what the exchange rate will be at that time i shall be happy to do the arithmetic for him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble lord is mistaken <e> <s> we have never said that the procurement period for trident certainly not trident ii was years although we at one time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble lord made a number of mistakes in that supplementary question <e> <s> first it is not the case that polaris will continue to be an effective weapon system into the distant future <e> <s> by the mid-s or thereabouts the effectiveness of polaris will be declining sharply particularly because the submarines on which they are carried will be wearing out <e> <s> in any event it is not the case either that the cost of the trident ii programme has materially increased over the period that the noble lord suggests <e> <s> in real terms it has not increased on the contrary it has rather declined <e>", "<cs> my lords on the contrary i anticipate converting the noble lord to my view <e>", "<cs> my lords i was saying that a number of savings have been effected at various points in the development of the trident system <e> <s> if the noble lord would like me to let him have details i shall be happy to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords the evidence given by general meyer to the senate defence committee in has been carefully examined <e> <s> the words which he used put in their proper context do not bear the interpretation which the noble lord has sought to put on them <e>", "<cs> my lords i assure the noble lord that i am doing no such thing <e> <s> so far as general meyers words are concerned there is an important distinction to be made between direction or execution of a political decision and the decision itself <e>", "<cs> my lords the details of the nato arrangements for these matters are confidential and i cannot therefore go into the kind of detail that the noble lord is asking me to <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have just explained to the noble lord lord jenkins there is an important distinction to be made between the direction or execution of a political decision and the decision itself <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly bear all such considerations in mind in the circumstances to which my noble friend points <e>", "<cs> my lords i was recently in the falkland islands and i am aware of the kind of views to which the noble baroness refers <e> <s> of course much of the money provided by the foreign and commonwealth office will be used for the purposes that she describes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of any significant claims that remain to be assessed but if the noble lord is aware of any i shall be happy to look into them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that the total sum of money is very large but freedom does not often come cheap <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the case that a large number of mines in the falkland islands remain in position and have not yet been removed <e> <s> we are working very hard to devise methods of doing that but as the noble earl may be aware plastic mines are particularly difficult to deal with in that way <e>", "<cs> certainly not my lords <e> <s> although details of the exercise are classified i can say that it is designed to test military command and control procedures and is firmly based on natos deterrence strategy <e> <s> it is thus helping to preserve the civil liberties and human rights which we enjoy today <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to see what i can do for the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot go into the details of the scenario of this exercise as i have said <e> <s> however as i have already explained the exercise is designed to test the full spectrum of natos procedures and plans for crisis management in times of tension and war <e> <s> i am certain that it will do that <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to contribute to the noble lords fertile imagination if he will forgive me for not doing that <e> <s> however i can tell him that this exercise has been very carefully planned and there will be no question of civilian participation along the lines that the noble lord suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords the british docks board to which the noble lord referred is not part of the arrangements to which i have been referring <e> <s> the noble lord will not be surprised to hear that i disagree profoundly with the observation in the second part of his supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am afraid i do not wholly agree with the noble lord <e> <s> i believe that when yarrows and the other companies come into private ownership they will be much better placed to compete in world markets than they have been recently in public ownership and i look forward very much to that <e>", "<cs> my lords it is british shipbuilders specifically who are seeking bids for the companies concerned <e> <s> the noble lord will be aware that they have asked for bids for yarrows brooke marine and hall russell and it is for them to determine the detail of the arrangements that they are now putting in hand <e> <s> i do not think i can go further than that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indeed satisfied that the future arrangements will prove satisfactory <e> <s> it is perhaps worth remembering that per cent <e> <s> or more of our defence requirements have always been provided from the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord is referring to the royal ordnance factories <e> <s> in regard to the terms governing the transfer final agreement with the trades unions has still to be reached on the pensions scheme for transferred staff <e> <s> discussions are continuing on the basis of government proposals and i hope that these will be concluded soon <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i fancy that that question goes a little wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> nonetheless i can assure the noble lord that whatever arrangements are appropriate will be made <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has asked me to refer to facts <e> <s> i am afraid that the facts are that yarrows and the other british warship building yards have not been particularly successful in world markets recently <e> <s> i hope that their transfer into the private sector will change that situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i view these matters from a diametrically opposite point of view to that of the noble lord <e> <s> the noble lord says that no argument has been advanced as to why these firms should be returned to the private sector <e> <s> i say that there was no single argument why they should have left the private sector in the first place <e> <s> they should now be returned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indeed aware of that fact <e> <s> that was why i was obliged to remind the noble lord lord shinwell that that firm and the others have not been particularly successful in international markets in recent times <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am sorry if my noble friend thinks that progress has been slow but this is a very complicated subject <e> <s> the aircraft are required for service in about the mid-s or shortly thereafter <e> <s> the total number of aircraft anticipated is of the order of of which the united kingdoms share might be in the region of <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a collaborative project <e> <s> the british and french aeroplanes which i believe my noble friend has in mind are simply technology demonstrators and are not meant to be prototypes for this project <e>", "<cs> my lords the defence ministers concerned will be considering the feasibility study some time later this year <e> <s> after that we shall move to what i think is called the project definition phase <e> <s> further decisions will need to be taken after that <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add to those of every other noble lord who has spoken my words of gratitude to the noble viscount for raising this subject this afternoon <e> <s> it is as topical as it is heartrending <e> <s> the plight of the refugees in africa that we watch nightly on our television screens from the comfort of our living rooms has awoken the conscience of this country and indeed across the world <e> <s> it is right that we should discuss this issue <e> <s> i welcome the opportunity to put the governments views on record and to recount the steps that we are taking <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend will be aware of my very considerable personal interest in these matters <e> <s> however i hope that he will forgive me if i do not say anything to anticipate the consideration being given to these matters by my right honourable and honourable friends <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that i can go no further than the answer which i gave to my noble friend a moment ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i dislike being negative in answering your lordships on this matter a matter in which as i said to my noble friend i have some considerable interest <e> <s> however my right honourable and honourable friends are now acting in a quasi-judicial role in this matter <e> <s> therefore i hope that your lordships will forgive me if i do not go further <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can go further than to say that my right honourable friend and my honourable friend will certainly want to reach conclusions on this matter as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there was some confusion in the minds of some people about the number of contracts which were available and the number which have been awarded <e> <s> the number of which appears in the question tabled by the noble lord was the number of contracts so far awarded <e> <s> that related to some months ago and the number is now <e> <s> i must say that i am disappointed that only firms out of the which have been invited to bid have in fact chosen to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> the answers that i have given relate to the other per cent <e> <s> which is being acquired from the united states <e> <s> it is the case that so far as the trident programme is concerned per cent <e> <s> of the total united kingdom acquisition will come from united kingdom sources and at the peak of the programme it will employ some people altogether <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not recall the per cent <e> <s> figure to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> if that figure ever existed it was certainly a long time before i had anything to do with these matters <e> <s> however we certainly intend to proceed with the programme <e> <s> i do not imagine for a moment that the percentage to which i have referred today is likely to change significantly <e>", "<cs> my lords at th september which is the last date for which i have figures contracts had been placed valued at million dollars <e> <s> since then the award of a further contracts to additional companies has been reported bringing the total awards to just over million dollars in value <e>", "<cs> my lords again that was rather before my time <e> <s> i should have to see exactly what it was that the <e>", "<cs> my lords all these questions relating to the parity of the pound and the dollar are purely hypothetical and i hope that the noble lord will forgive me for not seeking to answer them <e> <s> following the seesaws of the past few days and weeks if anyone can really anticipate what the pound-dollar ratio will be in say three or four years time he is cleverer than i am <e>", "<cs> my lords it would certainly be good to have as much as we can of the high technology work to which my noble friend refers but we must i think be careful not to duplicate high technology facilities in this country which already exist elsewhere because that might render nugatory some of the value of purchasing these systems from the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that that is the view of the noble lord but it is not mine <e>", "<cs> yes my lords my noble friend is right we are building the submarines and the warheads and the united states are supplying the missiles and the fire control system <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is mistaken <e> <s> the object of this programme is not just to spend money in the united kingdom though we are spending a substantial sum of money in the united kingdom it is to provide ourselves with an effective deterrent well into the next century <e>", "<cs> my lords yes the bids to which i have referred today are a comparatively small <e>", "<cs> my lords the european community continues to call for an early end to this tragic conflict <e> <s> we have supported these efforts and those of the united nations secretary-general who has been involved in a number of initiatives <e> <s> on th june he appealed to both sides to cease attacks on civilian targets <e> <s> both sides accepted and this agreement has largely been adhered to <e> <s> the secretary-general has also called on both sides to refrain from using chemical weapons and to cease attacks on shipping in the gulf <e> <s> we shall continue to support all realistic initiatives <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the best way for progress to he achieved in this matter is for the parties to this dispute the iranians and iraqis to accept some of the offers of mediation which have been made <e> <s> most recently of course there were the japanese proposals which came before the general assembly in september last year which we believe to be both balanced and well conceived <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord is right to suggest that our influence in these matters is somewhat limited <e> <s> nonetheless it is an appalling conflict and we should like to do what we can to bring it to an end <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as prisoners of war are concerned it is quite right that a report on that matter has been prepared under the secretary-generals auspices <e> <s> i understand that it is being considered by the security council this very day and i hope that some constructive proposals will come out of that <e> <s> we certainly support action being taken in the security council in that regard <e> <s> we believe that any resolution should concentrate on the report itself not on the wider issues of the conflict <e> <s> on the question of trade with both countries i think that my noble friend lady young wrote to the noble lord on this recently and i do not think that i can add anything to that letter <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right about that <e> <s> there have been a number of regrettable incidents in the gulf recently with regard to shipping <e> <s> indeed the safety of shipping was one of the matters addressed by the japanese proposals which came before the general assembly recently and to which i referred a moment ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his appreciative words on british government policy <e>", "<cs> my lords any situation which results in a reduction in the numbers of people being killed or maimed is to be regarded as satisfactory but taking the wider view the continuation of this dispute cannot in the least be regarded as satisfactory and i hope that it can swiftly be brought to an end <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that would certainly be one of the advantages which would flow if this recommendation were to be agreed to but there would be some arguments in the other direction as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that i have nothing to add save the observation that bodies in receipt of government finance almost always seem to think that they ought to have more <e>", "<cs> my lords there have been no cuts <e> <s> as my noble friend indicated to the house on rd january and again on th february funds for external services have been increased in each of the last five years <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot give assurances of the kind that the noble viscount seeks because the number of hours and the nature of the broadcasting that we undertake in individual languages depend upon the circumstances at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords all of the -odd recommendations of the perry review will be carefully considered before we reach our conclusions <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord refers to the world service which of course broadcasts in english <e> <s> there is no question of any changes to that <e>", "<cs> my lords the standard of audibility varies from place to place around the world <e>", "<cs> my lords we have or more embassies and other missions around the world <e> <s> i am not sure that i have in front of me information on the views of all of them <e> <s> it is certainly the case that embassies report from time to time that audibility in particular is not as good as it might be in certain parts of the world and that is why we are seeking to improve it <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can do more than recite the sums of money that have been made available to the bbc under various heads over the years <e> <s> for example the figure for was million the figure for was million and the figure that i have in front of me for is million <e> <s> those figures show a steady increase in the funds that we have made available <e>", "<cs> my lords those were cash figures <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole thrust of our policy is designed to avoid the kind of scenario which the noble lord describes <e> <s> the question is therefore hypothetical <e>", "<cs> yes my lords on the same basis as the polaris fleet is assigned <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole purpose of our independent nuclear deterrent is to add to the deterrent posture of the western alliance and that it has succeeded in doing for more than years <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend and indeed the noble lord lord beswick that we have the political will to respond in whatever way appears appropriate at the time <e> <s> the argentinians made a mistake about that in <e>", "<cs> my lords as i made clear in my original answer i decline to speculate upon circumstances of which i cannot yet be aware <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord and i may understand that the nato deterrent is indivisible but what is important is to ensure that the soviet union understands that and that is the principal purpose of our independent deterrent <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain there are <e>", "<cs> my lords i am partially reassured by the question which the noble lord puts to me but if he thinks that there is some alternative to replacing the polaris force i have to say that i think he is mistaken in that view <e>", "<cs> my lords as always both my honourable friend and i are right <e> <s> the question of shaddock which the noble lord raises ought to be considered in the context that it is very much an obsolescent system and probably would not justify a place on its own in the negotiations <e> <s> certainly we do not dismiss the idea of talks covering the whole range of nuclear weapons generally but in terms of reaching agreement in arms control matters we very much prefer the step-by-step approach <e> <s> no other has proved to have any kind of potential for success so far <e>", "<cs> my lords i am bound to share the noble lords disappointment about the progress of disarmament discussions generally in years past but i doubt whether progress would have been any better with one country or another hectoring the superpowers from the wings <e>", "<cs> my lords the problem is that we have to face these talks from the point of view of reality from the world as it is rather than the world as we would wish it to be <e> <s> i should certainly like to see a world where nuclear weapons are substantially reduced and even eliminated but i would countenance that happening only in a balanced and verifiable way and not in a way which exposed us to greater danger rather than less danger <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand and i must confess that my information on this matter is no more up to date than is that of the noble lord that the talks are to go ahead tomorrow <e> <s> i sought to inform myself on this matter a few minutes before i came to the house and i was given the same information as the noble lord has <e> <s> i too share his regret at the death of president chernenko <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the last part of the noble lords question is that the system is negotiating itself away <e> <s> it is obsolescent and not likely to remain in service for much longer <e>", "<cs> my lords during his visit my right honourable and learned friend stressed once more the difficulties which the exchange controls can cause and asked that as the zimbabwean economy improves greater flexibility should be shown both for company remittances and for individual hardship cases <e> <s> in reply the zimbabwean authorities made clear as they have done in the past that their present restrictions reflect a real shortage of resources but confirmed that if the economy improved sufficiently they would consider some relaxation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that there are constraints such as those which my noble friend has described although i do not believe that the extent of such difficulties is as great as some people imagine <e> <s> if there are any specific cases which my noble friend would like to draw to my attention then naturally i will see if they can be examined <e> <s> i can say that the zimbabwean authorities are prepared to consider specific cases where genuine hardship exists and where a proper need can be demonstrated <e>", "<cs> my lords the united states army field manual which sets out the airland battle states quite clearly that the fundamental mission of the united states army is to deter war <e> <s> that is clearly also natos objective <e> <s> as to the question of using nuclear weapons there can be no question as i have told your lordships on a number of occasions of the cruise missiles in this country being used except with the consent of the british prime minister <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly i would not wish to say anything which caused any difficulty for the negotiators in geneva but i fear that it may take longer than hours to determine what new policies if any the new soviet leader intends to follow <e>", "<cs> my lords the airland battle concept is a national united states concept and does not therefore form part of nato policy <e> <s> in any event united states forces are constrained within the airland battle concept to follow nato policies where they apply <e> <s> the airland battle concept is a wide-ranging concept <e> <s> it includes for instance provisions for jungle warfare which can hardly find a use on salisbury plain <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i agree with the precise figures which my noble friend offers but certainly they are of that order <e> <s> the figures also underline how impossible it is for us to agree to a freeze with that sort of imbalance existing <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not think it would have been right to include those figures <e> <s> they never have been included as the noble and gallant lord will know <e> <s> in any event our system is of course a strategic system <e>", "<cs> my lords again i fear that i do not have the precise figures before me but certainly there has been an increase in the number of sss deployed during that time <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i do not know about a lunatic exercise but it certainly makes all the more important the talks which are presently going on <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly hope that the talks to which the noble lord has referred will proceed and will be successful <e> <s> the role of the united kingdom is a peripheral one as far as those talks are concerned because our own nuclear forces represent such a tiny part of the whole <e>", "<cs> my lords the sum which we contributed to the initial funding of this organisation was million <e> <s> the sum which we contributed to the first replenishment was million <e> <s> that latter sum constituted about per cent <e> <s> of the total of the oecd countries share to the funding of the organisation and i imagine that our contribution to the second replenishment will be of the same order <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i do not share the jaundiced view of my noble friend about this organisation <e> <s> a recent evaluation of some of its programmes suggests that it generally achieves worthwhile results <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that this organisation is the most cost-effective of the organisations working in this field <e> <s> however as i said just now in answer to my noble friend it does a worthwhile job and we shall continue to support it within the framework of the agreements to which i have referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord is right <e> <s> we want to cure the disease rather than just treat the symptoms <e> <s> indeed that is why we so strongly support the task that this organisation is carrying out <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend that we need to be sure and need to continue to assure ourselves that the funds that we make available are properly spent <e>", "<cs> my lords i ought to make it clear that the government are not necessarily in a position to do precisely as the noble lord requests <e> <s> we are not actually in the driving seat so far as this organisation is concerned <e> <s> contributions are agreed among all the donors <e> <s> as the noble lord will no doubt be aware there are three baskets of donors and we go along with the general consensus <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot be precise as to when an announcement will be made but a large number of nations are involved as i am sure the noble lord will be aware <e> <s> the two principal groupings are opec and the oecd and it is necessary for those two groupings to agree and indeed for the groupings themselves to do so before an agreement can be reached <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the last matter to which the noble lord referred has yet to be decided <e> <s> however the percentage of the oecd funds which we contribute has remained about constant throughout the time that we have been making contributions to this organisation and i imagine that that will continue <e>", "<cs> my lords the routes which have understandably given some difficulty are those between turkey and greece and also i think some routes inside the ussr about which surprisingly or not surprisingly perhaps we do not have very much information <e> <s> as for the savings in costs this is a matter for the airlines to pronounce upon but generally speaking something of the order of five dollars an aircraft mile is the sort of saving that could be envisaged <e>", "<cs> my lords my heart and my head go in opposite ways in this matter but i have no doubt the noble baroness will find an opportunity to question me if she sees any dilatoriness among the <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that is correct <e> <s> there were some alterations during the course of the consideration of this matter <e> <s> iata being the body most seriously involving the airlines is not slow to bring forward its views and quite right too <e>", "<cs> my <e> <s> lords with your lordships permission i should like to repeat a statement that is being made in the other place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for defence on the selection of a new basic trainer aircraft for the royal air force <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to both noble lords <e> <s> i share the disappointment that it has not been possible to select what has been called an all-british aircraft for this contract <e> <s> one needs to recognise however that there was no all-british aircraft tendered for this contract <e> <s> not one of them proposed an english engine for example regrettable though that may be if i may respond to the noble lord lord grimond <e> <s> there was simply no suitable british engine available <e> <s> two engines were considered as noble lords will recall from when we discussed this some months ago <e> <s> the one that has eventually been selected is the garrett air research engine an engine of united states origin but of which about one-third will be manufactured in this country for this contract <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for the sentiments he expresses but this decision was taken on the basis of the merits of the proposal which shorts put to us <e> <s> the fact that it will result in some useful employment in northern ireland is an added bonus <e> <s> however i must emphasise that this decision was taken on the basis of the proposal made to us by shorts in relation to the price and specification of the aircraft and in accordance with the requirements of the royal air force <e>", "<cs> my lords if that is the intention of the brazilians they have kept it secret from me <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord is right and i know that the royal air force are looking forward very much to receiving their tucano aircraft <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall deal with my noble friends final supplementary question first <e> <s> as i said earlier the arrangement between embraer and shorts is such that shorts will have exclusive sales rights in certain countries of the world while embraer will retain their right in certain other countries <e> <s> for example it is obviously preferable for embraer to be advancing sales in latin america and in egypt where they already have a significant presence <e> <s> as for the price of the firecracker i can assure my noble friend that it was significantly greater than the price which we are proposing to accept in respect of the tucano <e> <s> but my noble friend will be aware that it is not our practice to go into detail on these matters for obvious reasons of confidentiality <e> <s> on the question of whether british or japanese or indeed any carbon fibre is to be included in the construction of this airplane that is not a detail that i have in front of me but i shall find the answer and let my noble friend know <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier i share the general disappointment that it has not proved possible to select a wholly british aircraft to meet this requirement <e> <s> but this is not the first time the raf has acquired a foreign-built aircraft <e> <s> indeed it is not the first time the raf has acquired a foreign-built trainer <e> <s> the harvard for example which was used as an <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give the noble lord an unequivocal assurance on the point that he put to me <e> <s> this aircraft will fully meet the requirements of the royal air force <e> <s> it would have been unthinkable to acquire an aircraft that did not do that and i hope that was made clear in the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that intervention <e> <s> the return of brazil to civilian government as he says was in fact presided over by my noble friend lord whitelaw only recently <e>", "<cs> my lords i doubt whether i can give the noble lord an assurance on the last point that he raised <e> <s> such money as is not spent on this project will no doubt find other useful purposes within the defence budget generally <e> <s> we are determined to ensure that we get the maximum value for money from the total amounts we can make available for defence purposes and the competitive process that has led to this result will contribute to that desirable end <e>", "<cs> my lords i can unequivocally answer the noble lord lord barnett and the noble lord lord kennet who put similar points <e> <s> there can be no question of renegotiating the price at which we are to acquire these aircraft <e> <s> the risk will cut both ways <e> <s> if some advantage is to accrue to shorts as a <e>", "<cs> my lords i promised to write to i believe the noble lord lord mulley on the details of the countries where shorts will be able to sell the aircraft <e> <s> i shall be happy to send a copy of that letter to my noble friend <e> <s> in answer to a noble lord who put this point earlier i indicated that shorts has in the past received substantial government support <e> <s> that support has declined in recent years as the company has become more successful <e> <s> i think that that success is amply demonstrated by the way it has secured this contract <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter for others than myself <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble lord has not had answers to questions but then he did not put any <e>", "<cs> my lords of course none of the contenders for this contract proposed to build outside the united kingdom <e> <s> the brazilian-designed aircraft which has now been successful will as i have already indicated be built in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords the british governments position in this matter whether it be my right honourable friend the prime minister my right honourable and learned friend the foreign and commonwealth secretary or my right honourable friend the defence secretary is enshrined in the four points which my right honourable friend the prime minister enunciated following her recent meeting with president reagan <e> <s> i imagine that those points will be familiar to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the questions which my right honourable and learned friend was posing related to later aspects of this matter <e> <s> we are at present considering the research phase of this programme and i certainly hope that british companies will be able to participate in that <e>", "<cs> my lords it would certainly be madness not only from the point of view of our companies but also from the point of view of the considerable advances which are being made in this area by the soviets <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure i wholly grasp the purport of the noble lords question but we certainly hope to make an important contribution to this programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree with my noble friend <e> <s> that is why i said that we are now considering what contribution we can make <e>", "<cs> my lords i invite the noble lord to examine the actual words that my right honourable and learned friend used rather than some reports of them <e>", "<cs> my lords that is hardly a matter for me <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the prime minister and indeed the foreign and commonwealth secretary have made it clear and this emerged too in the four points which were enunciated in washington some weeks ago that we are at this stage concerned only with research <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add my thanks to those of every noble lord who has spoken this evening to the noble lord lord gladwyn for raising this matter and for giving me a chance of clarifying the governments position on these important issues <e> <s> it is without question that the existence of nuclear weapons and their possession by both sides dominates our strategic thinking today <e> <s> their enormous destructive power renders traditional <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall reply to both noble lords <e> <s> i think the noble lord lord graham of edmonton and to a lesser extent the noble lord lord mayhew labour under the misapprehension that it is necessary for the national interest to be served that these facilities should be in the public sector <e> <s> i do not for a moment accept that proposition <e> <s> the fact is that over per cent <e> <s> or more of ministry of defence requirements come from the private sector and in a time of crisis such as we experienced in the <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may answer my noble friends two points <e> <s> the first was about the capital needs of the contractor if we go along the <e>", "<cs> my lords i assure your lordships that there is no question of gambling with the security of the nation <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no question of gambling with the security of the nation as the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords we have no particular target as to what percentage should be in the public or private sectors <e> <s> however i have no difficulty with the proposition that per cent <e> <s> should be in the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords i remember very well the case that the noble lord describes <e> <s> it was i who made that assertion on behalf of the government and i stand by it to this very day <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case my noble friend cannot count <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add my vote of thanks to the noble lord lord shackleton for introducing this debate this afternoon <e> <s> since the last major debate in this house on a broadly similar theme in december there have been major advances in the development of the islands <e> <s> the new constitutions have been promulgated for the falklands and for the dependencies which are to be known as south georgia and the south sandwich islands <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is putting what i regard as a hypothetical question <e> <s> we have embarked upon a policy of securing a multilateral regime for the area concerned <e> <s> i hope and believe that that is attainable and i would rather not speculate on a course that we might seek to adopt if in the end that was not possible <e> <s> we have not yet determined that it is not possible <e> <s> on the contrary i hope and believe that it will be <e>", "<cs> my lords again i hesitate to put a rigorous time barrier on such discussions <e> <s> my own experience in these matters such as it is leads me to suppose that a barrier of that kind is not the way to achieve the aims that we all want to achieve <e> <s> therefore i hope my noble friend will forgive me if i do not answer his question in a specific way <e>", "<cs> my lords no in the last resort decisions as to the constitutional disposition in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it therefore devolves upon us to take account of the views of the falkland islanders as we have been doing ever since we became responsible for these things some years ago <e> <s> we also keep in mind the conclusions of the noble lord lord shackleton in his reports on the dependencies potential particularly in terms of marine resources <e> <s> we have noted the noble lords view that further investigation into this potential is necessary <e> <s> the british antarctic survey continues its important activities <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise if i misinterpreted the remarks of the noble lord <e> <s> perhaps it is of benefit to other noble lords that i can explain the difficulties of that proposition <e> <s> as i said the antarctic treaty is geared to territory where there is no permanent population <e> <s> its direct application would therefore not meet the situation of the falkland islands <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may answer first the noble lords second supplementary <e> <s> i am pleased to be able to say that the -nation conference on disarmament in geneva recently reached agreement to address the present position including all relevant treaties along the lines proposed by the western delegations last year <e> <s> the united kingdom believes that these talks could usefully supplement but not replace the united states soviet talks on this subject and we certainly plan to play a full part <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the european foreign ministers and defence ministers can reach views on whatever subject they like <e> <s> they are not subject to the kinds of pressures the noble lord imagines though naturally they take into account all the views that are relevant <e>", "<cs> my lords on the contrary i know of no nato country which departs from the proposition that what we are seeking are balanced and verifiable measures of arms control <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not totally left to the super powers though naturally they have a prime interest in these matters <e> <s> that is why i was happy to be able to tell the noble lord lord molloy in answer to his earlier supplementary of the progress that is being made in the committee on disarmament in geneva <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i am not yet in a position to give the noble lord the information for which he asks but perhaps i may sound a warning note about the desirability of summits whether attended by prime ministers or presidents or even foreign ministers or defence ministers dealing with what are essentially technical matters <e> <s> i believe that technical matters and verification is most certainly one of them are best dealt with by technical experts <e>", "<cs> my lords i merely said to the noble lord that i was not yet in a position to answer his question <e>", "<cs> my lords of course there is no question of excluding the european powers from the submission of ideas in this area <e> <s> indeed in the united kingdom we ourselves have taken a leading role in proposing measures of verification in the chemical weapons discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords east timor was one of a number of issues which my right honourable friend the prime minister raised with president soeharto during her recent visit to indonesia <e> <s> the content of the discussions is of course confidential but i can assure the noble lord that the indonesian government are well aware of our position on east timor <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that the problem of east timor is best resolved between indonesia and portugal the parties directly involved and the united nations <e> <s> her majestys government hope that a fair solution acceptable to all concerned can be found by diplomatic means <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that we deplore abuses of human rights wherever they occur and the indonesians are well aware of our position on that matter <e> <s> we believe that this problem as i said is best resolved by discussions between the parties principally concerned and those discussions have our blessing <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that that is not so <e> <s> as i said in answer to the noble lord lord cledwyn we deplore abuses of human rights wherever they may occur and we lose no opportunity of expressing our views in appropriate cases <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my word of thanks to my noble friend lord home of the hirsel for initiating this debate today <e> <s> my noble friend has of course long experience in the highest offices of the land including a distinguished record as foreign secretary <e> <s> but he also has been specifically involved in east-west affairs <e> <s> it was for instance in his time at the foreign and commonwealth office that the initial discussions leading up to the opening of the conference on security and co-operation in europe the csce took place <e> <s> in his speech at the opening meeting in helsinki my noble friend though i am not sure that he was my noble friend then because i think it was before he returned to your lordships house in july said some words which are relevant to our debate today <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only say to the noble baroness that i have to take the world as i find it and not as i would wish it to be <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to draw together the strands of this debate i am conscious that i may do so only with your lordships permission and i hope that i have it <e> <s> i am conscious too that this has been an occasion of the utmost importance witness the number and eloquence of the speeches and indeed the standing of so many of the participants <e> <s> at this late hour i suspect that your lordships would not wish me to deal with each and every point from each and every speech but perhaps i may touch on one or two which struck me as particularly important <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i shall certainly see that the remarks of the noble lord and of other noble lords are brought to the attention of the relevant ministers <e> <s> the noble lord lord mayhew and my noble friend lord mottistone referred to the support of the soviet union for terrorism in various parts of the world <e> <s> the soviet union has indeed provided support including military training for a wide variety of what it calls national liberation movements <e> <s> however and unfortunately western terrorist groups have shown themselves perfectly capable of developing terrorist expertise from their own resources and there is no reliable evidence of soviet control of or substantial support for terrorist activities in the west <e> <s> indeed the soviet union has from time to time condemned individual acts of terrorism <e> <s> the soviet press for example was critical of the brighton bomb attack <e> <s> that the soviet union may be a beneficiary from terrorist activity in the west does not of itself prove that it supports or encourages it on any but a purely opportunist basis <e> <s> so far as concerns ireland it is true that there is much soviet press comment sympathetic to the more extreme political views of some sections of the irish republican movement in northern ireland but there is no evidence of soviet material support for the terrorist activity of the provisional ira <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a matter of regret that we have been unable to establish diplomatic relations with albania <e> <s> but as i have explained the objections come from the albanian side and not from her majestys government <e> <s> the albanian government have made it clear that they are not prepared to enter into relations with the united kingdom until the quantity of gold currently in the control of the tripartite commission for the restitution of monetary gold to which they have laid claim is delivered to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid we have not yet seen any sign of a change of policy by the albanian government but this is early days and perhaps we shall in the future <e> <s> we hope so <e> <s> my noble friend is quite right to point out that the international court at the hague found in our favour in regard to the corfu channel incident <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of any contact between the british government and the albanian government since the death of mr hoxha <e> <s> he was not in fact president the president of albania at that time was the man who has now succeeded to the leadership of the party in albania <e> <s> that was the post that mr hoxha held up to the time of his death <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not have the current value available to give to the noble lord but it is quite a substantial sum <e> <s> as for the gold being negotiable i should make it clear that the united kingdom is not a totally free agent in this matter because we are of course only one member of the tripartite commission which controls the gold <e> <s> the other members are the french and the united states <e> <s> before anything can happen to it we have to have the agreement of all three of those parties <e>", "<cs> my lords there are i believe meetings of the commission from time to time but there are a number of difficult problems to be resolved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that the other governments have disclaimed any ownership of the gold or any claim to it <e> <s> but then of course i cannot speak for either the french government or the united states government <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will be grateful to my noble friend lord reay for giving us an opportunity this evening to debate the appropriate response to the threat posed by the existence of chemical weapons in the world today <e> <s> let us be under no illusions <e> <s> chemical weapons can be weapons of mass destruction and constitute a particularly abhorrent method of waging war <e> <s> but they exist and we cannot ignore them <e> <s> ever since they were first conceived nations have sought to find ways of eliminating the possibility of their use in armed conflict <e>", "<cs> my lords it is as certain as i can make it but i hope that the noble lord will forgive me if i do not go into further detail <e> <s> i am certain that the noble lord lord mayhew with his experience in these matters will understand the difficulty in which i find myself <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said just now this is a united kingdom assessment <e> <s> there are some or more specialist soviet troops responsible for aspects of nuclear biological and chemical warfare and soviet forces regularly train in a chemical environment using real and simulated agents <e> <s> by contrast of our allies the united states possesses chemical weapons but these are not declared to the alliance <e> <s> the united states has not engaged in production of chemical weapons since and in consequence it now has only a limited and ageing retaliatory capability <e>", "<cs> my lords my impression is that the soviet stocks are current and modern but i do not think i can go into greater detail than that <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that we were more likely to succeed <e> <s> i claimed that the resulting convention would be more likely to be successful <e> <s> of course we have an existing convention stemming from the geneva protocol which as we have all seen has not been particularly successful <e> <s> it is that lack of success that we hope to correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i have the answer in front of me <e> <s> the question in fact went slightly wider than the point which the noble lord put to me which is why i did not read out the answer since it dealt with other matters as well <e> <s> i will quote referring to the particular point which the noble lord raised from part of the answer <e> <s> it read <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that it is correct to say that the airlines do not have all the information that they want in these matters <e> <s> for example the list of organisations which eurocontrol consult on a formal basis includes the international air transport association the international air carriers association the association of european community air carriers and a number of others <e> <s> in fact the organisation to which the noble baroness refers in her question has not i understand made a formal request for recognition in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness will be aware i think that the function of eurocontrol has changed in recent years and that it is now collecting the charges on behalf of the participating countries rather than the members and therefore relies upon the charges raised by those countries <e> <s> each of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not suppose there was ever an organisation that relished the idea of charges going up but i believe that the airlines understand the need for the charges as they are presently applied <e> <s> however as i said in my original answer their views are very closely attended to <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the answer to the noble lords question is no <e> <s> it is a matter for the participating states to reveal in as much or as little detail as they choose the basis for the charges that they make <e> <s> as far as the united kingdom is concerned we go into very considerable detail and i draw the noble lords attention to the annual report of the civil aviation authority which covers this point <e>", "<cs> my lords eurocontrol is a result of a treaty entered into voluntarily by the nations concerned and it has to conduct its affairs in accordance with the terms of that treaty <e> <s> it is not possible for eurocontrol to impose its views or the views of one member on all the other members because naturally they would not agree <e> <s> different nations approach the issue of revealing details in a different way and that is inevitable in a grouping of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that the airlines need to be asked to carry only the minimum of charges that they should but in this case it is not the responsibility of the british government for example to impose upon other governments the sort of regime that they would prefer <e> <s> we reveal our own costs in as much detail as we can <e> <s> we encourage the others to do likewise but we are not in a position to dictate to them <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said the government remain committed to the united nations plan <e> <s> i therefore reject the basis of all the noble lords supplementary questions <e>", "<cs> my lords both the contact group of which the united kingdom is a member and indeed the south african government remain committed to the united nations plan and that is the basis of our policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his words <e> <s> our policy remains to ensure that the people of namibia have a chance to choose for themselves the government that they require <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i agree that swifter progress would have been welcome but unhappily it has not been achieved <e> <s> the contact group as such has not been particularly active recently as the noble lord will be aware but happily discussions are continuing among the united states the south africans and indeed the angolans and we hope that an agreed settlement will emerge before long <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the governments position on linkage has been previously well rehearsed <e> <s> while we do not accept the formal existence of the kind of linkage to which the noble lord refers nonetheless it is a fact of life that both the united states and the south african government have made their position clear on that <e> <s> it seems unrealistic to imagine that progress can be made without some recognition of that view <e>", "<cs> my lords we have consistently made our concern about human rights issues in namibia known to the south african authorities both privately and in public statements <e> <s> we shall continue to follow the situation there closely <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords while what the noble lord says about the previous government in namibia is no doubt true the fact remains that it suffered from the fundamental flaw that it had not been chosen by the people <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may like to consider settling his differences with the noble lord lord molloy over a drink in the bar later <e>", "<cs> my lords two drinks may be needed <e>", "<cs> my lords as i reminded your lordships on th april there are no chemical weapons declared to nato <e> <s> political control of the limited united states stocks of chemical weapons is of course a matter for the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely with the noble lord that what we need to achieve in this area is a total and verifiable ban on all aspects of the manufacture stocking and use of these weapons <e> <s> that as i explained to your lordships the other week is the essence of our policy in this matter <e> <s> the other difficulties that the noble lord describes point i think to the rightness of that policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no reason to believe that the ussr is showing any constraint in this area or indeed in any other <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the noble lords support of what is in fact our policy <e>", "<cs> my lords we are doing that too <e> <s> our defensive stance with regard to chemical weapons is one to which we attach great importance and to which we are giving considerable thought at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the best approach to a solution of these problems whether it be in chemical weapons in nuclear weapons or indeed in any other is a step by step approach <e> <s> that is the course that we are following and the one i believe that is the most likely to produce the desired results <e>", "<cs> not exactly my lords <e> <s> biological weapons as distinct from chemical weapons they are different are covered by a different and frankly more effective convention already in force <e>", "<cs> my lords the amount of chemical weapons held by the soviet union is we believe in the region of tonnes <e> <s> this as i explained to the noble lord lord mayhew the other day is a united kingdom estimate <e> <s> in recent years there has been an increase i think in the amount held by the soviet union <e> <s> in any event as the noble lord says stocks deteriorate so i am quite clear that manufacture on the soviet side is continuing <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall never be the first to use any weapon save in response to an attack <e>", "<cs> my lords the views of the supreme commander are of course most important but ultimate decisions in these matters must remain with the political leaders <e>", "<cs> my lords as my right honourable friend the prime minister has explained in another place the civil service commissioners indicated that in the particular circumstances obtaining they were satisfied that the appointment of mr levene should proceed without the issue of a certificate of qualification under the provisions of article <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the case that it was originally thought that it would not be necessary to refer this matter to the civil service commissioners because the original intention was that this should be on the basis of secondment <e> <s> as a matter of fact the civil service commissioners thought that too <e> <s> i do not therefore think that the problem that the noble lord indicates will arise <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is referring to what mr levene may do when he ceases to occupy this post the answer is that yes then restrictions will certainly apply <e>", "<cs> my lords i am bound to say that i cannot immediately see the relevance of that observation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble lord is mistaken <e> <s> the best offer was submitted by shorts and not by british aerospace <e> <s> british aerospace were indeed informed of the deadline <e> <s> there was a telephone call made by the principal director of contracts air to the group commercial director of british aerospace mr alan smith <e>", "<cs> my lords british aerospace have not been party to all the tenders submitted for this contract <e> <s> i say again that the tender that they submitted was not the cheapest <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to give the noble lord a categorical assurance on both points <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure what purpose such a document would serve but our views on this matter have been made very clear <e>", "<cs> that may be so my lords but the policy of those governments is of course a matter for them and not for me <e>", "<cs> my lords we have of course proposed some qualification with regard to the luxembourg compromise <e> <s> i draw the noble lords attention to that <e> <s> it is on page of the report <e>", "<cs> my lords i think my noble friend makes a good point <e> <s> among the other proposals that we endorsed and indeed brought forward during the deliberations of the dooge committee was the one that provided for members to take greater advantage or make greater use of the possibility of abstention in accordance with certain articles of the treaty <e> <s> i hope my noble friend will find that helpful too <e>", "<cs> my lords we have not closed our minds to some element of reform in this matter <e> <s> however as for an inter-governmental conference we are not clear what that conference could achieve that could not be achieved by a european council <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is no doubt right but of course the position is not quite as black and white as he makes it out to be <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it is for me to speculate on what view such governments may take upon the assertions of the noble lord lord gladwyn <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a hypothetical question because the conference has not yet been agreed upon <e> <s> indeed the governments view is that it would serve no particularly useful purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps this is not the right moment to go into the detail of what the noble lord has said <e> <s> however if he looks at the paragraphs ahead of the one that he read out he will see that they too are relevant <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to both the noble lord and the noble baroness for their reception of this statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i will give as many as i can <e> <s> the purpose of the announcement that we have made today incorporating the decisions which it does is of course to ensure that we provide sufficient airport capacity into the s for the demand as we believe it will arise at that time <e> <s> the noble baroness commented upon the regulatory machinery that we have referred to in the statement <e> <s> that will require legislation and will be brought forward as soon as an opportunity can be found <e> <s> it will be very necessary that that legislation provides for some control of the monopoly aspects of airports because certainly there are some airports in the land which enjoy something of a monopoly in the position which they occupy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his welcome for the statement <e> <s> so far as removing the limit of movements at heathrow is concerned that limit has not yet in fact <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord takes the statement that way <e> <s> i believe that we have been accommodating to the regions <e> <s> over the past five or six years we have provided as i said earlier or authorised at least some million for expansion and redevelopment at those airports <e> <s> we have adopted a most liberal licensing regime for new air services operating from those airports <e> <s> the noble lord may be aware of the recent regional air services directive that has emerged from the european community in which we took a leading part <e> <s> indeed if we had had our way it would have been much more liberal even than it is <e> <s> we have now authorised the operation of singapore airlines from manchester <e> <s> that is a major step forward <e> <s> it was implied that we had taken some time to reach that decision <e> <s> in fact the singapore government lodged the application with us only in march this year and it was authorised a few weeks ago <e> <s> only a month or two was taken by us in our consideration of that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the number of houses before me but we anticipate that in due course stansted will be offering employment opportunities for some people <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two aspects to the point raised by the noble lord <e> <s> we have decided to commission a study into surface access generally to heathrow <e> <s> in regard to stansted we are also asking british rail to look at the possibility of providing a rail link to stansted airport <e> <s> at present as the noble lord may know the railway proceeds as far as bishops stortford <e> <s> i suppose that the most obvious solution would be a spur from bishops stortford to the airport <e> <s> that would of course be a matter for british rail <e> <s> we have asked british rail to look into the matter and to bring forward proposals with some idea of the cost <e>", "<cs> my lords our preference is for the council of transport ministers to make a regulation in this matter <e> <s> that i think would be the swiftest and most effective resolution to this problem <e> <s> we do not rule out the possibility of legal action in due course if that is not achievable but for the moment at least we prefer to follow the other course <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that deregulation on the american model is probably further than we would wish to go <e> <s> of course the circumstances are different in the united states <e> <s> that is a national market and we are facing an international question here in europe <e> <s> we have reached three agreements of a bilateral kind which offer the sort of improvements we are looking for with the netherlands with germany and with luxembourg although the last two are rather recent <e> <s> unhappily some of the other european countries seem less willing to reach bilateral agreements than the ones which i have just mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an interesting reflection but probably not flowing from the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the commission produced last year some guidelines which we felt did not go far enough <e> <s> we think that the right course now is for the council of transport ministers to reach a conclusion on this matter and i hope they will do that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not have the date of the next meeting of the council of transport ministers but i shall certainly try to find out and let the noble baroness have it <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not proposing a slogan of the kind that the noble lord suggests nor indeed do we offer a slogan of the earlier type which he mentioned <e> <s> there is a limitation to what can be achieved by bilateral methods <e> <s> although the noble lord pointed to some successes and rightly so which we have achieved in that area we have also discovered some failures in that area <e> <s> i am not saying that we have gone as far as we can in bilateral negotiations <e> <s> on the contrary i hope there is more to be gained <e> <s> but some countries within the european community are very resistant to any change in the existing bilateral arrangements <e>", "<cs> no my lords i shall do no such thing <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that the incidence of abuse to which the noble lord refers has significantly declined in recent years and there is of course no question of anyone in these circumstances having any access to nuclear weapons or any other weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an interesting observation which i cannot verify or otherwise deal with <e>", "<cs> so i have heard my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is entirely correct in that assumption <e> <s> the safeguards are very stringent indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is of course asking for information which he is not authorised to receive <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very proper point of view if i may say so but i imagine that the questions of the noble lord lord jenkins of putney are well known to our brave allies <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships probably will not wish me to extend question time by responding to that supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will forgive me for saying so he is quite good at quoting things out of context <e> <s> the fact of the matter is as i said earlier that abuse of this kind has sharply declined in recent years and i am sure that the noble lord will be very glad to hear that <e>", "<cs> my lords we clearly need to keep our national arrangements under careful scrutiny at this time <e> <s> indeed my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport yesterday met representatives of the major airlines and airports who attend the national aviation security committee to review security measures at united kingdom airports <e> <s> i understand that the committee itself plans to meet next week <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure about the last point <e> <s> i am persuaded to think that the real solution to this problem is to ensure that the terrorists never get what they want <e> <s> if we can achieve that this problem will die away <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lord has a point although i am not quite sure how we get around that difficulty because in this country at least we have a free press <e>", "<cs> my lords i have some sympathy with the point of view of the noble lord in this matter but the problem has always been to ensure watertight international compliance with these conventions <e> <s> it is our task to see what we can do to improve that situation <e> <s> that was one of the things in the mind of my honourable friend mr spicer who is currently attending the icao meeting in montreal which is addressing these problems <e>", "<cs> my lords the last point may go a little wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> with regard to the provision of equipment i fancy that the problem is not so much the provision of equipment although i must say in parenthesis that there is no technical panacea to these problems as the will to use it effectively <e> <s> i fancy that many of your lordships will have seen x-ray machinery attended by a man doing a crossword <e> <s> as far as the united kingdom is concerned we will never give in to the demands of these terrorists and if they come here they will go no further <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that domestic action of the kind described by the noble lord is a good deal easier to achieve than international action which is what is necessary if we are to achieve the end which the noble lord has in mind in this matter <e> <s> to achieve a worldwide blackout on events such as the ones we have been witnessing recently is a very difficult thing indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i can usefully add to the answers that i and my noble friends have given to the noble lord on th april th may th june th july th december th march th march st may th october th november th november th december th december th february and th march <e>", "<cs> my lords that is information which the noble lord can extract from an examination of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i was getting worried by the earlier exchange <e> <s> i am reassured by what my noble friend has now said <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a general convention that parliamentary questions cost something like each to answer so i imagine that my noble friend can do the mental arithmetic for herself <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord has repeated more or less word for word the implications of the original answer that i gave <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e> <s> i have already deployed the reasons why this order is before your lordships tonight <e> <s> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i will reply as quickly as i can to some of the points raised by the noble lord <e> <s> as i said earlier there will be a necessity for legislation some time next year <e> <s> i am afraid that i am not in a position to anticipate in detail what that legislation will contain <e> <s> we have of course been considering the recommendations made by the select committee which reviewed the armed forces bill <e> <s> perhaps i can explain one or two of our conclusions <e>", "<cs> my lords i have described the parliamentary procedure that will be adopted <e> <s> as your lordships will be aware there is a fair history to these things <e> <s> i can remember some pretty unpalatable resolutions of your lordships house in connection with aviation matters not least one of those moved by the noble baroness lady burton some years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness continues i wonder whether she would be good enough to say who these experts are who produce these views <e>", "<cs> so do i my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords when i replied to our debate on the inspectors report on th february i was not able to respond to many of the points made by noble lords for fear of prejudicing the quasi-judicial role of my right honourable friends the secretaries of state for the environment and for transport who had to take the difficult but necessary decisions on the stansted and heathrow planning applications <e> <s> but these decisions have now been taken and announced so that that constraint no longer applies <e> <s> consequently i hope to be very much more helpful than i was on that occasion in dealing with the questions that have been raised in todays debate although in deference to the noble lord lord tordoff and the celebrations to which he now plans to proceed i shall try not to do so at inordinate lengths <e> <s> it has been a long and arduous week and i would not wish to make it more so <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness wishes to take that view then she is entitled to do so <e>", "<cs> yes my lords it was withdrawn but the noble baroness said that we had no choice <e> <s> i would not accept that for a moment <e> <s> however in any event that is what she wanted and that is what we have done <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of the proceedings which took place in another place on this matter but i come back to what i said just now that the removal of this limit is what the noble baroness had in mind i understand when she spoke in <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a great wad of material in front of me and all of that will emerge from the answers i shall give in due course <e> <s> the noble baroness also raised the question of the rail link to stansted <e> <s> that could indeed be a very desirable development but it must await british rails evaluation <e> <s> if it proves justified in financial terms british rail will wish to invest in it and i see no reason why m right honourable friend should not approve the investment <e> <s> clearly such services if priced at the right level can pay for themselves provided of course that there is enough traffic <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not want to dispute that because of course the noble lord was intimately involved in that consideration nearly years ago <e> <s> but i imagine that my noble friend would agree that air traffic control considerations in those days taken as they were so long ago may well look very different today <e> <s> indeed as i said in my opening speech and as paragraph of the white paper states the terminal that is the second terminal at gatwick is not likely to be used to full capacity until the mid-s <e> <s> this does not mean that gatwick will never reach the mppa that the terminals can handle but that it will take a little longer to achieve than we at one time thought <e> <s> this together with runway constraints at heathrow reinforces the need to provide additional runway capacity in the south-east and justifies the decision to develop stansted an airport which already has a full-length but under-used runway <e>", "<cs> my lords the proposal is that in we should look again at the future of prestwick in the light of whatever may happen between now and then <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that in recent years prestwick has made continuous losses of a quite considerable kind and clearly it is not right that those should be allowed to continue indefinitely <e> <s> there are some signs that those losses may be reduced or even eliminated in the years ahead and if that happens i am certain that prestwick will have an assured future <e> <s> but i do not think there is any panacea to the problems of prestwick like for example the construction of a railway station but doubtless that would have some benefit if it were to come to pass <e> <s> the important solutions for prestwick would lie in additional traffic feeding additional services so that the airport would not continue to make the sort of losses that it has made recently <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the fears of the noble lord in this matter <e> <s> but i think i can assure him that in technical terms anyway the prospects are for a steady improvement in the noise made by aeroplanes and i believe that there will be a steady improvement too in the noise environment around heathrow <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> as the noble lord says an export licence was granted for the demonstration model <e> <s> we have not received any application for a full export licence for centaur vehicles to chile <e> <s> any such application would be considered carefully taking into account all the prevailing circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that the type of embargo which the noble lord has in mind would actually achieve the end that he seeks <e> <s> we repeatedly and continuously make clear our views on <e>", "<cs> my lords history would suggest that my noble friend is quite right <e>", "<cs> my lords i offered no defence for the abuses of human rights which occur in chile or indeed elsewhere <e> <s> we make our views known to the chilean government on appropriate occasions <e> <s> on the question of the state of seige to which the noble lord referred i understand that the state of seige was lifted recently by the chilean government and we shall be watching to see how matters develop following that <e> <s> however on the wider question on how one differentiates between arms destined for one purpose or another i point out that one needs to recall that the un charter no less i think that it is article confers the right of self-defence upon all the signatories to that charter <e> <s> that is a right which we ourselves enjoy and one which we would not wish to disturb in others <e>", "<cs> my lords we have not yet taken a decision on whether the centaur vehicles to which the noble lord refers should be exported to chile <e> <s> indeed we have not yet received an application nor so far as i know have the suppliers received an order for the vehicles <e> <s> we shall want to take our decision in the light of all the factors relevant when and if those events occur <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that there is no prospect of an atomic bomb-type explosion occurring by accident or mistake <e> <s> even the possibility of the release of the radioactive component of a nuclear weapon in such circumstances is extremely remote <e> <s> nevertheless it is clearly prudent that there should be contingency plans for dealing with any such accident however unlikely and detailed arrangements exist for this purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can go further than the main answer i gave in answer to the second part of the noble lords supplementary question <e> <s> however in answer to the first part of his question i can assure him that we engage the very best expertise available in these matters and that is why i can give him the reassuring answer that i do <e>", "<cs> my lords with repect to the noble lord our civil defence arrangements do not arise directly from this question which specifically relates to the movement of nuclear weapons <e> <s> i do not think i can go further than the answer that i gave to the noble lord lord molloy but i agree with the noble lord lord graham about the general desirability of civil defence <e>", "<cs> my lords there are important security considerations which have to be taken into account in preparing our plans for the circumstance to which my noble friend refers <e> <s> i can assure him that we have all those considerations in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord that those in some local governments who oppose our arrangements in this area might have a heavy burden to bear if the worst were to happen <e> <s> i can do no more than repeat what i said earlier to the noble lord lord molloy that the prospect of an accidental discharge of a nuclear weapon is very remote indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i can almost agree with the noble lord <e> <s> i have said that the prospects of an accidental discharge are so remote as to be almost capable of being ignored but we do not ignore them <e> <s> we make detailed arrangements to ensure that it does not happen and i can do no more than underline the answer that i originally gave to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> in moving this amendment the noble lord said that he was speaking also to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> however i believe the noble lord will agree that very similar arguments apply to amendment nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> if the noble lord agrees i should like to reply to all four amendments <e>", "<cs> i think there may be a misunderstanding about the way that clause l will operate <e> <s> your lordships may therefore find it helpful if before addressing this amendment i outline how this provision will work <e>", "<cs> this clause makes provision for the proprietor of a licensed taxi to hold a special public service vehicle operators licence the grant of which takes account of the fact that he has already satisfied a licensing authority of his suitability to operate the vehicle in question as a taxi and the restricted use to <e>", "<cs> as regards drivers hours for taxi drivers there is already a provision contained in the town police clauses act for a district council to make by-laws controlling the hours during which a taxi driver may exercise his calling <e> <s> very few however have found a need or chosen to do so <e> <s> this view is supported by available accident statistics which do not indicate that there is a need to apply drivers hours rules to taxi services <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may help the noble lord very swiftly <e> <s> the noble lord may not have at his fingertips the provision of the london cab act which i believe provides a power for both the functions to which the noble lord has referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i assure the noble baroness that that remains our view <e> <s> the council is to meet again on th november which i agree is a <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter for the presidency it is the italians at the present time and it will be the luxembourgers at the turn of the year <e>", "<cs> my lords the sentiments of my noble friend have a familiar ring about them but i agree wholeheartedly with him to the extent that we want to ensure a much more competitive regime in these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always ready to receive the congratulations of the noble baroness <e> <s> my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary had some useful discussions with his french counterpart last week <e>", "<cs> my lords the united kingdom spoke early in the meeting in firm support of botswanas statement to the committee <e> <s> this is reflected in the joint statement which followed the meeting <e> <s> there was no question of the united kingdom not supporting the other members of the commonwealth <e>", "<cs> my lords the meeting to which the noble lord refers is a routine meeting being held at official rather than ministerial level <e> <s> it will review the present situation as far namibia is concerned and hopefully chart the way forward <e> <s> i do not want the noble lord to imagine that some great new insight will emerge from that meeting because he will appreciate the difficulties that have emerged in the past and the disappointing lack of progress that there has been in this area thus far <e> <s> as regards our general stance towards this issue the noble lord will be aware that we have deplored the violence that has occurred in southern africa from whatever source it came <e>", "<cs> my lords the result of the sort of policy the noble lord has in mind of course would be to isolate south africa not only from commerce and trade which i think lies at the heart of what the noble lord proposes but also from the influence that we believe we can bring to bear in seeking to persuade her to modify her actions and indeed to move forward so far as the namibian matter is concerned <e> <s> it is for that reason that we do not believe that sanctions would serve any useful purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords the truth is that the scope for action as the noble lord describes it is somewhat limited south africa is after all an independent sovereign nation <e> <s> the way forward we believe is by way of persuasive arrangements <e> <s> we have been involved in that way for a number of years <e> <s> i agree that the progress has not been significant and we regret that very much but we are not persuaded that an alternative course would yield any better results <e>", "<cs> my lords yes we did agree with that part of the statement and indeed with all of the statement that was issued after that meeting and we have made our views on this matter very clear to the south african government <e>", "<cs> my lords namibia is not really a commonwealth matter it is of course a united nations matter as the noble lord will appreciate <e> <s> it is the implementation of united nations security council resolution no <e> <s> to which the noble lord referred earlier which we believe is the key to success in that area <e> <s> we shall be seeking to persuade south africa of that view <e> <s> i am not sure that is specifically a matter for the commonwealth meeting in nassau later this year <e> <s> as to sanctions i believe we have made our view clear on that matter <e> <s> we do not think that they would achieve the result that is desired <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asks me to answer what is a purely hypothetical question <e> <s> our present position is that we do not believe sanctions would have the effect which the noble lord desires <e> <s> i would ask him to reflect on all the occasions in history when sanctions have been applied and have proved to be useless <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is quite right london taxis are not affected by this bill <e> <s> they are governed by different legislation which this bill does not seek to address <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord will be aware the controls applied in london are quite different <e> <s> there is in effect no numerical control on taxi licences in london <e> <s> as the noble lord is also aware because i have referred to this at an earlier stage of the bill we are conducting a major review of taxi legislation which is something rather different and we expect to come forward with changes in due course <e>", "<cs> i hasten to confirm what i said to the noble lord lord shepherd a moment ago <e> <s> we propose to undertake a major review of taxi and hire-car legislation <e> <s> i imagine that this will lead to legislation <e> <s> but naturally that will depend in the end on the outcome of the review that we undertake <e> <s> the noble lord also referred to the position in liverpool <e> <s> i am not sure that i agree that chaos and disorder have resulted from the changes that took place there <e> <s> while there have certainly been a significant number of taxis licensed in liverpool this we believe has been largely at the expense of hire-cars whose numbers have significantly reduced at the same time <e> <s> we believe that this shows how market forces are already working in the right direction <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has said that he is offering a prize <e> <s> perhaps it will be appropriate if i rise to claim that prize in the hope that i shall be able to assist your lordships committee to some extent <e> <s> the words of the noble and learned lord lord denning are of course always listened to with the closest attention in your lordships committee <e> <s> however i think that the purport of what the noble and learned lord said this afternoon was broadly to the effect that unless all the statutes referred to in legislation before your lordships were contained in the noble and learned lords library they were not appropriate for inclusion in such legislation <e>", "<cs> i believe that i can help the noble lord lord shepherd in this matter <e> <s> the position now is and as always i speak subject to correction in these rather detailed matters that the lord chairman will put the question that this clause shall stand part of the bill and it is open to my noble friend lord renton to oppose that motion if he thinks fit or not as the case may be <e> <s> nothing that he may do or not do today would prevent him from tabling a motion as he would have to do at report stage to leave out this clause if it is in the bill at that time <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say that i should prefer that this clause remained in the bill <e> <s> the points raised by the noble and learned lord lord simon are something that i should like to consider <e> <s> i have given my noble friend lord renton a very clear assurance which i am happy to repeat that i shall consider in detail the points he raised and discuss them with him to see whether there are any detailed amendments we can agree between us that should be made to this clause <e> <s> i remain of the view that the purpose of the clause is clear and highly desirable and it is for that reason that i invite your lordships to agree that it should remain part of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for those last remarks <e> <s> i want to say again that what we are seeking to do here is to ensure that the bus trade if i may call it that is more freely available to a large number of vehicles than it is at present <e> <s> the total deregulation of the taxi trade is not what we are about in this clause or in this bill <e> <s> i should not wish to bring forward a proposal of that kind <e> <s> if there are some corrections amendments or improvements that we can make to the drafting of this clause i shall be happy to discuss those with my noble friend lord renton <e> <s> we have some time between this and the next stage <e> <s> there will be ample opportunity for my noble friend and i and our advisers to get together <e> <s> i am happy to give the assurance that we shall do so <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say that i had some difficulty in understanding precisely what the noble lord had in mind regarding this amendment <e> <s> these drivers and their vehicles are licensed to ply for hire throughout london which of course covers many petty sessions areas <e> <s> on the basis that the driver intends to refer to the petty sessions area in which the licence is issued and that happens to be the area in which the public carrige office is located we have no objection in principle to the proposed change though that would have to be made clear in the drafting <e> <s> in addition i would certainly wish to consult those with responsibility for the magistrates courts <e> <s> if in the light of that forthcoming response the noble lord would care to withdraw the amendment i should be happy to discuss the detail with him and perhaps come forward with something more appropriate at the next stage <e>", "<cs> i shall speak first to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it proposes that although not licensed some of these vehicles should be allowed to carry passengers at separate fares <e> <s> first i should like to consider whether in principle sharing should be extended to these unlicensed vehicles <e> <s> since a fundamental principle of passenger transport has been that only vehicles subject to quality control should be permitted to carry passengers at separate fares and such vehicles were generally subject to licensing long before that <e> <s> we would i believe need very compelling grounds to breach that principle <e> <s> in london there may be as many as hire-cars more than double the number of taxis <e> <s> i think that it is agreed that it would not be right to extend sharing to the whole of the trade <e>", "<cs> being just a young fellow i am afraid that my memory does not go back far enough for me to be able to say how long it is that people have been talking about a need for review of this taxi and hire-car legislation <e> <s> but i can tell the noble lord lord mcintosh and the noble baroness lady phillips that we are now determined to press ahead with this review <e> <s> i cannot anticipate when if at all legislation will flow <e> <s> i imagine that legislation will flow but we shall certainly need to have the results of the review first and then to decide the way forward following that review <e> <s> we are determined to get on with this i can assure your lordships on that and i hope that i shall not need to make that point again <e>", "<cs> did my noble friend say -seater mini-buses <e>", "<cs> i had rather feared that after the impressive speech in support of the amendments my noble friend would be in need of some refreshment and would not be here for the benefit of my reply <e> <s> happily i see that he is still in his place <e>", "<cs> i hasten to say that i look forward to the day when i am driven by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord will be well aware i am not in a position to anticipate what this or any other queens speech may contain and so i cannot give him the categoric assurance for which he is asking but we certainly wish to proceed with this matter as soon as we can <e>", "<cs> with respect to my noble friend i have to say that i think that his amendments paint a rather pessimistic picture <e> <s> i urge your lordships instead to consider that this bill will rejuvenate the market for bus services and provide a better chance than the existing policies do that the industry will flourish <e> <s> after all i do not think that the ptes could feel particularly happy with their position at the moment <e> <s> all of them would doubtless say that they provide valuable services and no doubt many of us would agree with that <e> <s> but i am sure that many ptes will admit that recent trends in the industry represent an unhealthy state of affairs and that greater efficiency and enterprise would provide them with better value for money <e>", "<cs> i am glad to have this opportunity of explaining the position of pensions for staff transferred to public transport companies <e> <s> i know that pensions are a difficult issue of concern to staff and i hope that what i have to say will be of reassurance to those employees who may be affected by the establishment of public transport companies <e>", "<cs> my understanding of the position is that they may <e> <s> however perhaps i may check that and if i am wrong i shall write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i have listened very carefully to the arguments deployed by my noble friend in support of these amendments <e> <s> we have of course debated a similar set of amendments to clause dealing with the ptes and the companies that they will be forming and while of course i appreciate that we are dealing here with rather different bodies district councils and their undertakings i suggest that the same principles hold good for both <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have told the noble lord on a number of occasions this matter is in the hands of the police <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a view which has been expressed on a number of occasions but it does not i think arise from the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> there have been others including one in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i have no indication as to how the police inquiries are proceeding <e> <s> ministers have no power to interfere in such inquiries <e>", "<cs> my lords i am informed that the late gallant viscount lord nelson knew something about it <e>", "<cs> no my lords the government were not able to determine what happened to the log book <e> <s> that is why the matter was referred to the police <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i should like to repeat a statement that is being made in the other place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for defence about the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord lord graham viewed the statement with such distaste <e> <s> as for his suggestion that the consultation period was inadequate or ineffective while i agree that there were some sentiments of that kind expressed in the house of commons defence committee report nonetheless the fact is that we embarked upon a three-month period of consultation and i know of no one who wished to express views who did not have an opportunity to do so <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that all those views were taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i need specifically to respond to the words of my noble friend <e> <s> i am afraid that i was not around years ago on the occasion to which my noble friend referred <e> <s> yes it is the case that there were some important improvements which needed to be made to the royal dockyards but now that we have determined the right course of action as we see it i hope that my noble friend will agree that we ought to proceed with all speed <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the last part of the noble lords question is of course the important point that the contract will not be an open-ended one it will be for a fixed time <e> <s> the precise <e>", "<cs> my lords the most important avenue by which the naval interest will be secured will of course be through the negotiation stage in the contracts to ensure that the companies are required to make available such facilities as the royal navy will require for the duration of the contract <e> <s> there will be a special department set up within the ministry of defence to oversee the implementation of the contract and to ensure that the very important interests to which the noble lord has referred are properly covered <e>", "<cs> my lords refitting ships is essentially a commercial operation and i am bound to say that i think ministers of any political persuasion are the people who are least well equipped to conduct commercial undertakings and that is why we are moving in the direction which we are proposing <e> <s> incidentally the noble lord referred to portsmouth and in parenthesis perhaps i should say that the naval base of portsmouth is of course not affected by these proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend asks for an assurance that the contracts will be as simple as possible <e> <s> certainly we should like to see them just that but i have to warn my noble friend that there will be important features to these contracts which are to some extent perhaps unusual and which may militate against the pure simplicity that he has in mind <e> <s> not least among those important requirements is the one that was mentioned by the noble lord lord mayhew concerning the need to ensure that the royal navy gets the service that it requires not only on a scheduled regular basis but on an emergency basis if that situation should arise as doubtless it will from time to time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure what capital equipment requirements my noble friend has in mind but if he would like to tell me privately i shall look into the matter and let him know <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend that the work will always need to be conducted precisely in accordance with royal navy requirements and we shall see to it that the proper machinery is put in place to ensure that that happens <e> <s> but as my noble friend also indicated it will also be open to the royal navy to put their work out to other commercial dockyards if and when the need arises <e>", "<cs> i have listened very carefully to the arguments that my noble friend lord sandford <e>", "<cs> just before my noble friend does that i imagine that he plans to reflect on what has been said and perhaps return to the matter at report stage later in the year <e> <s> i have to tell him in plain terms that i doubt that there will be any difference in the governments position in fact i am certain there will be none if we consider this matter at a later stage <e> <s> i invite my noble friend to consider therefore whether he should really withdraw the amendment in those circumstances or whether it would not be better if he sought the view of the committee <e>", "<cs> that the community must avoid the kind of problems over extra territoriality of competition law which have proved so difficult in the context of the united states <e> <s> i am glad that my noble friend lord bethell found our intervention so helpful and has indicated his approval again today <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that the arrangements for charter passengers are more modest than those now in place for scheduled passengers <e> <s> i suppose it is fair to say that charter passengers are generally paying a good deal lower fare for their flights however much we may regret that and doubtless there is a certain element of you get what you pay for <e>", "<cs> my lords we would not accept that the loophole which has been described in some parts of the press and elsewhere actually exists <e> <s> the particular provision to which the reports have referred was one which was deliberately included in the legislation to provide the necessary element of flexibility <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as concerns the present act the noble lord will be aware that the football season has only just begun and it is really too early to draw any final conclusions on the matter although we are encouraged by the certain limited evidence that we have so far <e> <s> with regard to the content of the legislation which is to come forward in due course that is still being considered carefully and in detail and clearly i cannot anticipate that consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i agree that the house was not given sufficient time although i recognise that the bill was taken through fairly swiftly but it was necessary to get the bill on the statute book in time for the season which has just begun <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the noble lord as he understands any detailed description of what the bill will contain but clearly some of the shortcomings to which people have pointed in the act which is the subject of this question will need to be considered as to whether they should be corrected by this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i dare say that the noble lord is as well able to draw conclusions on the matters that he puts to me as i am <e> <s> however there is no present intention to extend the legislation to those other sports <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am aware that there is considerable satisfaction about the effect of the legislation in scotland but they have the benefit of a different legal system <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for those observations <e> <s> his intervention <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to that question is simple <e> <s> the employable labour force has been increasing at a faster rate than the number of vacancies the number of jobs has been increasing <e> <s> as for comparisons with other countries although there are some oecd figures such as those to which the noble lord refers unemployment is higher in a number of countries in the oecd than it is in the united kingdom <e> <s> furthermore trends in the united kingdom are now favourable whereas the trends in other oecd countries are less so <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have all the ec figures in front of me but i have just referred to the oecd figures and some of the oecd members are members of the european community as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that the noble and learned lord is right to suggest that the figures for the so-called black economy which are not <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is right to suggest that there are wide regional variations in the figures that i have referred to this afternoon <e> <s> there are a number of regional support schemes and job creation schemes most of which have their focus in the areas to which the noble baroness has referred <e>", "<cs> my lords it is factors such as that which have some effect on the figures to which i have referred <e> <s> however perhaps it is worth saying that a number of persons who are available for employment are doubtless only available for part-time employment and the same applies to the number of jobs <e> <s> so we are comparing like with like <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right to say that <e> <s> he is indeed correct <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is right when he says that the number of people employed in manufacturing industry has fallen but the number employed in service industries has greatly increased not only in this country but right across the countries of the oecd and others <e> <s> as for what the government are doing i believe the fact is that there are more people working in the united kingdom now than at any time in our history <e> <s> we need to ensure that the present trend of the increase in the number of jobs continues and then we shall see the number of those unemployed declining <e>", "<cs> my lords i sure my noble friend is right in what he says but then i have despaired of encouraging noble lords opposite long since <e>", "<cs> no my lords indeed i believe the trend is in quite the reverse direction of that to which the noble lord points <e> <s> for his further information employment in services over the period to which i have referred increased by the number of self-employed has also increased by a very substantial number over the same period also there has been a substantial increase in part-time employment which noble lords opposite seem to deplore so much <e>", "<cs> my lords it is of course the case that too many people are unemployed and that i deeply regret <e> <s> however the fact remains that people are employed which is more than in the previous period in question <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i can help my noble friend <e> <s> there were jobs available at jobcentres in september last month <e> <s> we reckon that that is about one-third of the total number of jobs available <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not that figure in front of me but i dare say that many of them form a portion of the new jobs to which i have already referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly make inquiries into the point which the noble lord raises and if i have anything to add to what i have already said i shall write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> the answer to the noble lords earlier question as to why the number of unemployed was not declining while the number of jobs was increasing is that the size of the work force is increasing even faster than the number of jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i am entitled to take the same comfort from that observation as does the noble viscount himself <e>", "<cs> of course my lords the ministry of defence is not the department of health and social security <e> <s> however i recognise the important views which the noble lord has represented to me <e> <s> the matter has been considered at very considerable length as the noble lord will know and i am convinced that we have arrived at the right conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord lord shinwell is referring to another question <e> <s> the question on the order paper relates to a consultative body which existed until recently and about which the noble lord lord hunter is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i think that departs a little from the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord carmichael for explaining the position of the passenger transport executives as he sees it in this context and i hope that i shall be able to reassure him and my noble friend about some of the fears which have been expressed <e> <s> but i have to say that i disagree with the view which has been expressed about the prospects of the new pte bus companies <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may have your lordships permission to speak again i did say that if any of the ptas have a real difficulty in this area they can apply to my right honourable friend for a redetermination of their expenditure limit <e>", "<cs> my lords we made clear in earlier debates that it is our intention that there should be a choice of options where staff are transferred from a pte to the employment of the initial company the ptc which will take over responsibility for the running of bus services <e> <s> it would be possible either for the staff transferred to be deemed to remain employees of the pte so that they could remain members of the local government superannuation scheme lgss or for the company to set up an entirely new scheme to which all employees would belong <e> <s> this would be a decision for the pte to take acting of course in consultation with the management of the new company <e> <s> the object of the present amendment is to take this decision out of the hands of the pte and the company and give an option of remaining in the lgss in the hands of every individual employee of the new company <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try to help your lordships <e> <s> it is of course the case that the benefits which employees under existing arrangements will have accrued for themselves under the existing local government scheme will remain <e> <s> those arrangements will be enshrined and employees will have this particular option to decide for themselves whether their accrued benefits should remain in the local government scheme or if they prefer be transferred to whatever new scheme is devised by the company <e> <s> that specific right will exist for individual employees <e>", "<cs> because my lords the option we are giving to employers will be to decide that all their employees not individual employees separately but all the employees of the organisation should remain part of the lgss as they are at present <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend said we have already debated some of the issues which he has raised on the amendments to clause moved earlier by the noble lord lord carmichael and my noble friend lord teviot <e> <s> i said in response to those amendments that the government could not accept that any transitional costs arising from the transfer of bus undertakings to the new companies should be met by government and before responding to the detailed points made by my noble friend lord sandford i think that i should state our position on that very clearly <e>", "<cs> my lords it is of course right that we should be debating pensions because they are undoubtedly a matter of the greatest importance and of concern to employees of district councils <e> <s> however i hope that what i have to say will give reassurance and show that the government have sought to be helpful on this issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great interest to the remarks made by the noble lord lord grimond <e> <s> i hope i can make it clear both that the government are quite convinced of the advantages of share ownership by employees and that this bill makes proper provision for it in the case of public transport companies <e> <s> in order to do so i should like to ask the noble lord to look at clause which provides that an authority may <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the best thing might be if i were to quote the relevant passage from the <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a suggestion which i dare say the noble lord lord jenkins will wish to consider probably at the same time avoiding taking his holiday at a point miles south-east of haifa <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i need any lessons in the need <e>", "<cs> to maintain the peace of the world <e> <s> that is why we have the policies that we do that is why we devote the resources that we do to our defence programme and that is why we have been successful for more than years <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that advice <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure as to which noble lord my noble friend is referring but i too have seen the boards to which he refers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i take the view that the one way to make nuclear war inevitable or in any event more likely would be for us to disarm unilaterally and that is why we reject that policy <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are of course wholly supportive of the efforts of the united states not only at the talks that are to take place in november but in the other fora which are already in process to reach balanced and verifiable methods of arms control <e> <s> that support will continue <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that both the united states and the other members of the western alliance take this matter most seriously <e> <s> i would advise the noble lord not to believe everything he reads as ascribed to the president <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure what the noble lord is referring to but the one thing that has been achieved under the administration of the president of the united states is the making of the strength of the western alliance such that nobody will now attack us <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord did not describe in any detail the event to which he was referring <e> <s> i can now understand the matter he had in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his appreciation of the efforts that have been made in the areas to which he refers <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to agree that the total number of unemployed people is far too high <e> <s> the policies we are adopting are aimed at reducing that figure <e> <s> it is true that a number of the unemployed <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to get dragged into a discussion about south africa <e> <s> certainly <e> <s> it is true to say that any constraints on our trading arrangements with countries overseas is likely to make the unemployment situation worse rather than better <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the case that major new capital plant does not always have the overall effect of reducing unemployment in a particular area or even in a particular factory <e> <s> the truth of the matter is that these days new machinery tends to use fewer people rather than more to operate it <e> <s> i do not think that that effect is one which the noble lord would wish to see <e>", "<cs> my lords i too saw the article written by mr gordon brown who i am told is the labour member of pariament for dumfermline east <e> <s> that article was littered with inconsistencies and inaccuracies <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord could not have listened properly to the answer i gave today nor to the reply i gave the other week <e> <s> what i am saying now in relation to the reduction in the increase referred to the last six-month period and not the last one-month period <e> <s> for the month of september there was as i said earlier a reduction of unemployed in the seasonally-adjusted level <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall certainly be targeting the programme at the areas in most need <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness is referring to the cost of employment referred to by her noble friend then that certainly is a matter that we need to look at <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will forgive me for saying so it seems to me that the policies of his noble and right honourable friends are of greatly increased public expenditure and the propping up of unprofitable industries in an attempt to solve the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords such action would merely ensure that inflation lifts off and that public expenditure gets out of control <e> <s> that is not a solution to the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not want to anticipate whatever detailed response may be given to the report to which the noble lord has referred <e> <s> however we have a sound record of encouraging foreign businesses to come to this country and set up manufacturing enterprises <e> <s> indeed a great many have done so in recent months and years <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the long term solution to this problem and i suspect there are very few short term solutions is the creation of an industrial and commercial environment which will allow our firms to grow to flourish and to prosper and that is the principle we shall follow <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord is right to the extent that we are now dealing with the results of difficulties that have been arising not just over the past five or years but perhaps the past or even years <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall come to that point in a moment but i believe i was asked too about the role of the united states in a peace settlement <e>", "<cs> my lords then it must have been another member of your lordships house and i apologise <e> <s> whoever it was who asked me that question the answer is that the united states are indispensable to the peace process because of their close links to parties on both sides of the arab-israel dispute <e> <s> my right honourable friend the prime minister has discussed the situation with president reagan and they agree upon the need for early and urgent efforts to make progress <e>", "<cs> my lords i will indeed look that up again if the noble lord asks me to do so but i remember much talk about his matter very soon after we came into office in <e>", "<cs> my lords yes of course i give the noble lord that assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords the united states has of course made it clear that it intends to follow the provisions of the abm treaty <e> <s> we hope that the soviet union will do likewise <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that there is a serious side to this matter <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that the arsenals of the super powers far exceed whatever may be needed for defensive purposes but clearly what is proposed would be a major first step <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot say when those talks are to take place <e> <s> however we have of course made clear on many occasions our position about talks with the soviet union most particularly in connection with our own forces which are not at this stage negotiable <e>", "<cs> my lords that depends upon what would cause the negotiations to break down <e> <s> in my view it is premature to be quite so gloomy as the noble lord seems to be but nonetheless i think that the noble lord would be right not to be too optimistic at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords it must clearly be right that the talks which are now to take place between the soviet union and the united states and which indeed are already under way in geneva on these matters should be between the super powers themselves who are of course the possessors of the two arsenals to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> the position of the united kingdom in these matters must remain peripheral to the main discussions which are taking place but naturally as always we stand ready to help where we can <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord rightly says that is a feature of the philosophy of the soviet union but i believe that it is becoming more and more obsolete <e>", "<cs> my lords needless to say i do not agree with the noble lord on that <e> <s> i believe that the measures that we have presently in place are largely satisfactory for the purpose that we now propose although it may be necessary to review one or two of the relevant orders <e>", "<cs> my lords the united kingdom has never sold oil to south africa <e> <s> under the terms of the guidelines the sale of north sea oil is confined to the european community and certain other countries <e> <s> as for the first part of the noble lords supplementary i am afraid that i cannot answer that specifically because it remains to be seen what we shall be doing in six monthss time <e>", "<cs> my lords the guidelines to which i have referred do not apply to petroleum products which was one of the matters in the noble lords question but they certainly apply to crude oil and as i say we have never sold any to south africa <e>", "<cs> my lords i hardly think that a successful economic policy justifies a repugnant social policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure how you use an air traffic control radar system for suppressing the population to which the noble lord referred but the noble lord will be aware that the export of almost every other item to south africa is subject to the export licensing procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords complex air traffic control radar systems often involve the use of computers <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend baroness young i beg to introduce a bill to extend the powers of the commonwealth development corporation to enable the secretary of state to make grants to the corporation and to enable him to impose restrictions on and to give guarantees in respect of borrowing by the corporation subsidiaries <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords this was not an economy it was an adjustment in the allowance arrangement which was no longer justified <e> <s> however the point to which my noble friend referred is a proper one <e> <s> it is the case that the pvr rate has nudged upwards in certain areas recently but that is as much a result of improved conditions outside the services as of any problems within them <e>", "<cs> my lords i hasten to agree with the noble lord that we want to provide the very best possible conditions of service for the members of our armed forces and the government have a good record in that regard <e> <s> we are constantly seeking to improve the various terms and conditions of the allowances which they have <e> <s> for example i was recently able to announce the provision of the third school childrens visit a matter which had greatly concerned members of the armed forces living in germany and elsewhere <e> <s> that will result in an improvement of say a year for those serving in cyprus for example and rather more for those serving further afield <e> <s> all of that has to be done within the context of what can be generally afforded <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only say again that i entirely agree with the noble lord that we have a need and a duty to provide the members of our armed forces with the very best possible terms and conditions obviously within the resources we can make available <e> <s> we have a very good record in that regard <e> <s> as a matter of fact the total annual bill for allowances of all kinds in the armed forces is something of the order of million a year <e> <s> that is a figure of which we can be proud <e>", "<cs> not without notice my lords because the rates vary according to the different categories <e> <s> the area where perhaps the greatest concern is being shown is that of technically qualified officers where naturally the rewards and opportunities outside the armed forces are particularly great <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly the cast that the adjustments to loa did bear differently on different ranks and different categories particularly as regards single and married men <e> <s> but as regards the latter category the effect of the cost of living of course bears differently <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the case that the young unmarried soldier receives hardly any loa the rate is just about zero at the moment <e> <s> but then the increased expenses which he incurs are minimal as well because he does not have a wife or family <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have those figures before me but i shall see what i can discover and let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and gallant lord for that intervention <e> <s> commanding officers were certainly given all the information that they could have needed for this purpose <e> <s> however i have to confess that some of the information was not given to them as quickly as it might have been <e> <s> we are seeing what we can do to overcome that in the future <e>", "<cs> no my lords i would not agree with that <e> <s> on the contrary since the agreement was signed we have agreed to speed up the provision of one of the sites from years to years <e> <s> my noble friend will of course understand that we have to re-provide the facilities on the sites in question before we can vacate them <e>", "<cs> my lords the developments proposed on the sites in question are as follows <e> <s> at queensway a large yacht marina apartments shop and restaurants <e> <s> at rosia bay a smaller marina also with apartments <e> <s> i dare say that a certain number of <e>", "<cs> my lords we have not yet been asked for a date by which we should release that site but if the gibraltar government want to bring forward detailed proposals we shall examine them urgently <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend is referring to the advice for which the gibraltar government are looking and naturally the source of that advice is a matter for them <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot say whether that point specifically was addressed <e> <s> however with regard to giving help to the government the noble lord will perhaps recall that these sites are being transferred to the gibraltar government free of charge <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that there were specific british government proposals for these sites <e> <s> these were and remain ministry of defence facilities for which there is a continuing use <e> <s> we have agreed to make them available to the gibraltar government at their request and will need to re-provide the facilities that are there at present <e>", "<cs> my lords these are matters for the gibraltar government <e> <s> certainly it must be for them at least in the first instance to make the plans <e> <s> we shall be ready to offer the government any advice if they ask for it <e>", "<cs> my lords a number of considerations caused us to decide on the day in question not least the convenience of a number of people who had made it clear that they wished to attend <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a feeling that that question may be leading me rather far from the one on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords widespread consultations took place some of which i conducted myself particularly with those involved in the far eastern campaigns <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the case that some of those who served in the far east came to regard themselves as the forgotten army <e>", "<cs> but i was present at brize norton when the pilgrims left on their journey <e> <s> i was happy to hear many of them say that they were forgotten no longer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to hear the views of my noble friend on this matter <e> <s> my noble friend lord gridley was also present i know in the far east on this pilgrimage <e>", "<cs> my lords we are of course in constant touch with the british legion on this as on other matters <e> <s> the noble lord will know that the end of the second world war and indeed the sacrifices made by many in a number of conflicts in this century and earlier are celebrated on a day normally in november <e> <s> in addition as the noble lord will be aware we have recently made available on a regular basis sums of money to the british legion to enable it to arrange visits to various cemeteries around the world <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the question of belated amends arises <e> <s> we have made clear that the various ceremonies and functions that we have arranged during the course of this year were designed to record the end of the second world war in all its theatres <e> <s> i do not accept that thousands feel as the noble lord suggests <e> <s> i have myself been involved in consultations with large numbers of them <e> <s> that view is not at all prevalent <e>", "<cs> my lords naturally i accept what the noble viscount says <e> <s> nonetheless i believe that the governments position on this matter is one that i can repeat to your lordships with assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure what kind of memorial my noble friend has in mind <e> <s> but of course the functions to which i have referred apply to the people lost at sea as much as to those lost in any other theatre <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall endeavour to reply to the points put to me by the noble lord lord graham and to cover at the same time those put to me by the noble lord lord mayhew although as both noble lords will recognise some of their points overlapped <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that president reagan has spoken as my noble friend has said but i think he suffixed his remarks by the observation that the price would have to be first calculated <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord pours such cold water on the four points to which i referred earlier <e> <s> i believe those points precisely meet the objections that he has raised <e> <s> i will quote from just two of them <e> <s> first this is a research programme and no more <e> <s> then from the fourth point <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that support <e> <s> as i have said more than once this afternoon this is a research programme and it is of course the case that there are a number of questions properly raised by eminent scientists that have yet to be answered <e> <s> but the history of scientific research in these demanding areas particularly in some of the major programmes carried out by the united states in the past for example the man on the moon programme is one of success and not of failure <e> <s> the united kingdom is therefore well advised to involve itself in the programme <e> <s> it is also the case that the intentions of president reagan have been misrepresented widely by those who would wish him ill <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may answer first the noble lords final question the other countries over and above those in nato who were invited to participate were i believe japan and israel <e> <s> i am not aware of what response they have made <e> <s> as far as other european nato allies are concerned i dare say that they too will be responding in due course although it happens that we are the first to do so on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that is the case at all <e> <s> the united states has made it quite clear that it regards itself bound by the provisions of the abm treaty <e> <s> the united kingdom is not a signatory to that treaty but naturally we too will be guided by its provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords clearly i cannot be specific as to the number of jobs that will be secured following british participation in these programmes <e> <s> that will depend on a number of factors not least and perhaps most of all the success that british enterprises achieve in the competitive process that will lead to the awarding of the contracts <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a confidential agreement between governments so i cannot do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord is referring to the contract for the ptarmigan system the british system which was tendered in response to a recent united states requirement <e> <s> in fact the british component of that contract was comparatively small so the total offer which was eventually made to the united states government consisted not only of the united kingdom contribution but of an important american contribution as well <e> <s> therefore we were not wholly in control of the price that was tendered for the whole package <e> <s> nonetheless it was disappointing that we did not achieve success on that occasion <e> <s> there will of course be a very different arrangement under the agreement referred to in the statement because the contracts will be made direct with british institutions by the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult to give a global figure in answer to my noble friends question because we cannot know what prices we would have been offered in a non-competitive situation <e> <s> however my noble friend may recall the example of the two-seat basic trainer ordered for the raf earlier this year which resulted in a contract price some million below the original budgetary estimate <e> <s> as for the percentage of our work being procured on a competitive basis that as i said in the original answer was per cent last year <e> <s> i should expect it to approach something like per cent this year <e>", "<cs> my lords as i think i have said from this box on more than one occasion the <e>", "<cs> my lords i referred to the million which i believe we saved in respect of the two-seat trainer <e> <s> the noble lord may care to reflect upon the million that i think we saved on the mcv contract <e>", "<cs> my lords i endeavoured to explain that the million was on the contract for the tucano two-seat basic trainer aircraft for the royal air force <e> <s> the million to which i subsequently referred was on the mcv armoured personnel carrier which we have recently ordered for the british army <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a good deal of sympathy with my noble friend on that point <e> <s> however as he says it is a matter of long-standing practice that these prices are not revealed and indeed we should wish to reveal them only in accordance with an agreement reached with the contractors themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords the trouble with that kind of competition is that it is rather wasteful <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the warped objectives to which the noble lord referred are the product of the noble lords imagination <e> <s> the united kingdoms position on this matter was very clearly set out in the four points to which i referred in the statement made earlier this week <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a number of technical questions still to be resolved <e> <s> that is why the united states have embarked upon a research programme in which we are proud to play a part <e>", "<cs> no my lords that is not the case <e> <s> the purpose of this research programme as i said in the original answer is to look at technologies which might enhance our security at lower levels of offensive weapons on both sides <e> <s> i agree that there are still some scientific matters to be resolved <e> <s> that is why there has to be a research programme and that is why we are part of it <e>", "<cs> my lords that was a point i endeavoured to make during exchanges on the statement earlier this week <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that some of our universities are interested in securing work under this particular programme but i am not aware that any contracts have been signed <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend is looking a considerable way into the future <e> <s> there are a number of hurdles that have to be overcome before we reach that point <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so the noble lord occasionally quotes things out of context <e> <s> the united kingdom position is clearly set out in the four points to which of course the president of the united states also adheres <e>", "<cs> my lords i reported to your lordships on th december that the memorandum of understanding concluded between the united states and the united kingdom governments on th december safeguards british interests in relation to the ownership of intellectual property rights <e> <s> as i made clear on monday the detailed content is confidential i am unable therefore to add anything to what i said then <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said the united kingdom has been at pains to ensure that proper arrangements are made with regard to the intellectual property rights that we have done <e>", "<cs> my lords the memorandum refers to a number of matters concerning national security <e> <s> it is for that reason that it has to be confidential <e>", "<cs> my lords the soviet union are of course conducting a major research programme into these matters as well <e> <s> the noble lord may not have had an opportunity to see the written answer which i gave yesterday to my noble friend lord alexander which was not published in yesterdays <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked me about the brain drain when we discussed these matters earlier this week <e> <s> i told him then that without the benefit of this agreement the brain drain would have been very much greater <e> <s> now of course the research is going to be carried on in this country and that means that there will be many opportunities for british scientists to participate here in the united kingdom <e> <s> on the question of the confidentiality of this agreement i am afraid it has been agreed that it should be confidential because as i have said it contains a number of matters which refer to national security <e> <s> i am afraid i cannot go further than that <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite correct <e> <s> it is not the case that every agreement of this kind or every memorandum between governments is secret but quite a number of them are and i am afraid this is one of them <e>", "<cs> my lords there is already in the library a document which refers to the specific areas where we believe british firms will have a particular interest and where indeed british firms and british institutions have a particular expertise <e> <s> we naturally expect that british firms will make a major contribution in those areas <e> <s> in that regard the noble lord might care to study the document which is in the library <e> <s> it is not possible to exempt british firms entirely from the competitive process but i am quite clear that they have such important and in some cases unique capabilities that it would be very surprising indeed if they did not secure a major part of <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not quite correct because there will be some areas of activity where british institutions or firms will be awarded sole-source contracts <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i have just answered that question in reply to the noble lord lord cledwyn <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish this one was as well <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord seems to regard this slower decline in the numbers employed in manufacturing industry as some terrible evil <e> <s> but i think on the contrary it is the result of much greater productivity in british industry and the much greater modernisation of plants which has taken place in recent years <e> <s> what is more important is the overall level of employment and as the noble lord will be aware there has been a significant increase in the number of jobs in recent years <e>", "<cs> my lords the solution lies in the direction of greater growth of investment in new manufacturing industries and the cbi forecast anticipates per cent <e> <s> growth in that area next year <e>", "<cs> my lords the rate of interest which companies have to pay like some of the other factors which respond to international rather than national pressures is not wholly within the gift of the government <e> <s> in any event we think that a sharp decline in the rate of interest would result in a rapid increase in inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not seen the report to which the noble lord refers but nobody denies that there has been a sharp decline in industrial activity in certain parts of the country in recent times <e> <s> the future lies as i suggested to the noble lord lord hatch just now in new investment in new industries <e> <s> that is the way for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble baroness that departs a little from the question on the order paper but i think the noble baroness will be aware of the governments views <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may recall an answer which i gave three or four weeks <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have just said the total number of people in employment in the united kingdom has increased in recent months and years despite the decline in some of the older manufacturing industries to which the noble baroness has referred <e> <s> the future will lie in an increase in the numbers employed in new manufacturing activities and also in an increase in those employed in service industries <e>", "<cs> my lords that is certainly one of the possibilities and one of the things that we are encouraging <e> <s> industries such as the older motor-cycle manufacturing industry were at their most successful at a time when competition was a good deal less than it is now in terms of modern manufacturing standards <e> <s> firms that were successful in earlier years were not able to keep up with modern trends <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept that there will be an increase in unemployment next year <e> <s> as i have already said we anticipate that the increase in the numbers in employment in the united kingdom will continue and if the total number of those people seeking work does not increase at the rate that it has recently then the numbers of unemployed will likewise decline <e>", "<cs> my lords that is another question if the right reverend prelate will forgive me for saying so <e> <s> nonetheless the government do provide substantial support for industry in all areas of the country but especially in some of the more difficult areas <e> <s> for example exports support to which the noble lord lord hatch referred just now is currently running at something of the order of billion annually <e> <s> research and development innovation which again has a benefit to some of the newer industries is costing some million and speaking from my own point of view as a minister in the ministry of defence we are spending something like billion annually with british industry <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is right that both the americans and the french have expressed interest in the project recently <e> <s> for our part we shall need to be certain that no new arrangements in any way cause the project to slip particularly in time terms <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble lord will forgive me if i do not get dragged into the westland matter at this moment <e> <s> but the noble lord is certainly right that an ambitious timescale will now be necessary if the efa project is to come to fruition in a timely way <e> <s> nonetheless we are satisfied that that can be achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords the number of jobs will depend upon the work share and the details of that have yet to be determined <e> <s> with regard to production the work share will depend upon the number of aircraft ordered by each of the participants <e> <s> with regard to the development phase it has been agreed that the united kingdom work share will be per cent <e> <s> on the question of the engine the united kingdom objective is to ensure that whatever engine is ultimately chosen for the efa aircraft it will be compatible in size and other factors with the existing rb engine fitted to the tornado <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a rather comprehensive supplementary question if the noble lord will allow me to say so <e> <s> what we are now engaged upon is the project definition phase to define exactly what is required by all the partners concerned <e> <s> with regard to french participation the noble lord will be aware that up to now anyway the french have taken the view that they wanted a rather smaller aeroplane than the one that is now proposed <e> <s> it is for that reason that they have not so far felt able to join in the project <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly we are most interested to receive whatever approaches the united states wish to make to the united kingdom and to the other partners in this project <e> <s> whatever they have in mind will be most carefully studied <e> <s> it is true as my noble friend has said that the tornado project has established a very good basis for pan-european cooperation in this matter and that it is now coming to a successful fruition <e>", "<cs> my lords the basis upon which american participation is currently being discussed is a fairly modest one <e> <s> i do not anticipate any fundamental change in the programme resulting from it <e>", "<cs> my lords the liquid waste produced by the atomic weapons research establishement at aldermaston is treated to remove as much of its radioactive content as is reasonably practicable <e> <s> the amount of radioactivity remaining is very small indeed and is well within the limits agreed with the department of the environment <e>", "<cs> my lords i did indeed see the yorkshire television programme since i played a major part in it <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that there is no scientifically-based evidence to support the assertions made in that programme relating to the incidence of the distressing diseases to which the noble lord has referred and which attempted to establish a link between that incidence and the presence of nuclear facilities in the district <e> <s> as for the safety regulations the noble lord is mistaken in his view that there is any current breach of those regulations at aldermaston <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right in his assertion and nothing done by the atomic weapons research establishment at aldermaston in any way detracts from what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords sometimes it is very misleading to quote figures whose basis may be difficult to understand in scientific terms <e> <s> however i shall try to help my noble friend in this way <e> <s> the radioactivity level of the waste that is discharged into the thames from aldermaston is something like one-tenth of per cent <e> <s> of the permitted level <e>", "<cs> my lords i have endeavoured to make an authoritative statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only repeat what i have said before both on the television programme and on other occasions <e> <s> there is no scientific basis for the allegations made in the programme <e> <s> but if the noble lord has any further information that he would like me to consider then i shall be happy to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the government will continue to take every opportunity to allay the unjustified public disquiet that has been raised by the television programme and on other occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the noble lords support <e>", "<cs> my lords the unjustified fears that have been raised by the television programme to which the noble lord refers are the responsibility of those who made the programme and not of her majestys government <e> <s> i can only say again that there is no scientific basis for the allegations that were made in the programme <e> <s> the level of radioactivity in the discharges made into the river thames at a point downstream to that from which the water supply is taken is as i have said before only a tiny fraction of the percentage allowed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the allegations made in the programme including that to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> the fact is that if one makes allegations one must have a scientific basis for them and i have seen no such scientific basis <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends observation only underlines the success of the efforts of the people at aldermaston and elsewhere to ensure that their discharges cause no danger to the public at large <e>", "<cs> my lords i dare say my noble friends mental arithmetic is better than mine in which case he is probably correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the noble lord that those who make unfounded allegations without any proper scientific basis at all carry a heavy burden of responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose that the noble lord does not realise that he is out of order <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble lord is mistaken about that too <e> <s> it is for the house to regulate itself and not for the chair to act <e> <s> the fact is that the noble lord was speaking for a second time during the course of this debate without the leave of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft order laid before the house on th november be approved <e> <s> with your lordships permission i should like at the same time to speak to the pneumoconiosis etc <e> <s> workers compensation payment of claims regulations <e> <s> these instruments are to be made under the pneumoconiosis etc <e> <s> workers compensation act <e> <s> the specified diseases order adds two additional diseases to those covered by the act <e> <s> the payment of claims regulations increase by per cent <e> <s> the amounts of compensation paid under the act to those who first satisfy all the eligibility conditions on or after st january <e> <s> i shall be glad to answer any detailed questions that your lordships may have on these instruments <e> <s> in the meantime i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords we have to strike a balance between the ability of employers to make those payments and it is generally for them of course and the desirability of meeting the increase in costs in other areas <e> <s> i may add that i understand that my right honourable friend has it in mind to review those amounts on a more regular basis in the future which i hope will reassure the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft order laid before the house on nd december be approved <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will allow me to speak at the same time to the unfair dismissal increase of limits of basic and special awards order which was also laid before your lordships on nd december <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i might reply to the points of the noble lord lord rochester <e> <s> first the noble lord is quite right when he says that we shall have an opportunity to discuss the important matter which he raised when the relevant legislation comes before us later <e> <s> but may i add to that the fact that for the past years the rebate system has provided an element of insurance for employers needing to make people redundant <e> <s> this may have been justified in the conditions of the s and s when there was concern about overmanning and a need to encourage a shake-out of surplus labour but in present circumstances there can be little to be said for a policy which amounts to the subsidising of redundancies <e> <s> we therefore think that the public expenditure provision can be better allocated to direct job creation measures leaving employers to make their own judgment about when to hire and fire people and to meet their own costs <e> <s> an exception is being made for the very smallest employers for whom the cost of redundancy may he disproportionately onerous <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this draft order be approved <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that the soviet union has about scientists and engineers or perhaps more working in the area to which my noble friend refers <e> <s> in addition a substantial number are working in related areas <e> <s> if we are referring to the soviet effort in that and related fields i need only remind your lordships that the only deployed anti-ballistic missile system in the world is around moscow <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may refer again to the system around moscow it is presently being modernised to include galosh missiles which are nuclear tipped and designed to intercept targets outside the atmosphere that is in space <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not deny that the scientific hurdles that remain to be overcome before a leak-proof system to use the noble lords words can be achieved whether in the soviet union or in the united states are considerable <e> <s> nonetheless i think that history leads us to suppose that sooner or later those hurdles will be overcome <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the history of negotiations leads us to suppose that the soviet union seeks to find itself in a position of strength before embarking on such negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords there certainly is evidence to suggest that the soviet union has violated the treaty although in some areas i recognise that there is room for more than one view <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that there are respectable views along the lines suggested by the noble lord but reliable information about soviet defence expenditure in terms that we can compare with our own is hard to come by <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that this question directly arises from the one on the order paper <e> <s> i can only say that whatever the sum of money being spent by the soviet union in these areas the results in terms of hardware are very substantial <e>", "<cs> my lords i never suggested that galosh missiles to which i referred were other than land-based <e> <s> the fact remains that they have a role to intercept missiles outside the atmosphere <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that the discussions in geneva to which the united kingdom is not directly a party are conducted very correctly and that the united states brings forward all the information of the kind to which i have been referring this afternoon <e> <s> so far as the western alliance goes we do more than bring it forward in the confidential discussions we publish it <e> <s> that is why i placed the document to which i have referred in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to british participation in the sdi research programme my noble friend will recall the statement on this matter that i repeated just before christmas <e> <s> i understand that negotiations between companies and institutions leading to contracts are proceeding very well <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall have to take into account the likely cost of such a pool but the noble lord may be reassured to know that there are already planned five football pitches six squash courts an indoor tennis court two gymnasia and a running track <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would have to be <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not wish to go further than the answer i have already given except perhaps to say that it will be a question of finding the necessary funds <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the problem to which my noble friend refers <e> <s> we are currently looking into this rather complicated matter to see what we can do about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the noble lords point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords the facilities are being provided primarily for the use of the servicemen down there <e> <s> there are very few dependants as my noble friend will know <e> <s> i see no difficulty in making them available to local people although i should perhaps add that very few local people live close to mount pleasant <e>", "<cs> my lords no i did not say that <e> <s> i do not think that would be at all proper <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the noble and gallant lord lord hill-norton intends to present a report on this subject before long but the government are not in any way connected with that report and certainly have not seen it <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i had a feeling that i would be asked that question <e> <s> the answer is that they of course set the specification in the first instance in accordance as i say with the requirements of the royal navy and they subsequently scrutinise the designs that are brought forward by industry <e>", "<cs> sadly my lords my noble friend over-simplifies somewhat <e>", "<cs> my lords i was hoping that my original answer would do that <e>", "<cs> my lords the government examined the so-called s proposal a year or so ago and found that the proposal that was then being mooted had a number of serious shortcomings <e> <s> incidentally the noble lord is mistaken as to the cost <e> <s> the cost of the type for example which is the sort of vessel for which it was proposed that the s should substitute is of the order of million <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend referred to the towed array and the possibility of towing that with a merchant ship <e> <s> unfortunately i think that that would not be a practical proposition because of the background noise caused by the merchant ship <e> <s> indeed that was one of the problems with the s too <e> <s> as to the question of helicopters to which my noble friend rightly attaches importance there was another shortcoming of the s <e> <s> there was not room on the deck to accommodate one <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord kennet is right to return to this important question <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the sort of judgment that the noble lord asks for but clearly if the soviet programme was proceeding on the scale that i have indicated it was right for the west to respond <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact that one is ahead at a particular moment does not mean that one will stay ahead if the other side is conducting a research programme of the scale to which i have referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i dare say that the blessing in disguise as the right reverend prelate refers to it will be heavily disguised for the relatives of those concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords that is i am afraid a technical question to which i do not know the answer <e> <s> perhaps i can find out and let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> my lords i have given the noble lord the view of the government in this matter <e> <s> i shall ascertain and let him have the additional information which he requires <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord recalls the occasion on which i repeated the statement in your lordships house about this matter <e> <s> that problem was gone into at some length on that occasion <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord would like to refresh his memory of what was said then <e>", "<cs> my lords i can certainly confirm that no danger at all has arisen from the incident to which the answer referred and to which i suspect my noble friend was referring as the basis of his question <e> <s> as for the risk in other countries so far as i know smallpox has been eradicated from the world altogether although there are occasionally cases that occur and have to be dealt with <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that as i understand it the virus is held only in the united states and in the soviet union <e> <s> i understand that it is kept there for research purposes <e> <s> how it came to be found in the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine is a matter now being investigated very fully <e> <s> i fear that i cannot go further than that <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to confess that i am not entirely certain what materials are required for the preparation of the vaccine but i can assure the noble viscount that should the vaccine be needed then it would be made available in whatever quantities were required <e>", "<cs> my lords in addition to the powers available to the government to which i referred just now under the companies act the company can require disclosure of the ownership of shares and i understand that sir john cuckney has today said that such action is in hand <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i apologise if i did not make myself clear to the house and to the noble lord <e> <s> once the identity of these persons is known the government will consider what further steps need to be taken and various powers exist for that purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords i have referred to the powers available to the company under the companies act <e> <s> there are in addition for example powers under the industry act to prevent a foreign interest taking control of an important manufacturing undertaking <e> <s> there are other powers for example under the fair trading act available to the director-general of fair trading <e>", "<cs> my lords we are of course not comparing like with like if i may say so to the noble lord <e> <s> in the circumstances to which he has referred we were of course transferring companies that were in public ownership to the private sector and that is a very different matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not certain from where the noble lord gets his information <e> <s> i understand that westland say that there are no swiss banks registered as holders of their shares <e> <s> as for what we might do in some hypothetical situation i am afraid that i would have to stop short of giving the noble lord the assurance for which he asks <e>", "<cs> my lords by means of the procedures i referred to earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble lord quite heard what i said <e> <s> i said that there were powers available under the companies act for the company to ascertain the beneficial ownership of their shares and that sir john cuckney had said that he is now following those procedures <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is again putting to me a question about what might happen in some hypothetical situation <e> <s> i hope he will forgive me if i do not answer on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords it comes from northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord and i am grateful to him for giving way <e> <s> the aircraft concerned are of course coming from northern ireland and not brazil <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will be grateful to my noble friend lord cathcart for giving us the opportunity this evening to discuss the governments decision announced in july to establish a defence school of music at deal <e> <s> this is i think the first time that this subject has been raised in your lordships house and i should like therefore to set out briefly the background to that decision <e>", "<cs> my lords it has always been the case that service bandsmen in whatever services have other roles and that was to continue <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that all relevant views including those to which he has referred will be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i made it clear that although i had every confidence in the officials who have done this work in the past we shall be taking the advice of outside consultants which i hope will set the noble lords mind at rest <e>", "<cs> my lords that is really i believe a question that should be addressed to the proprietors of the magazine concerned <e> <s> i do not think that i can help the noble lord further <e>", "<cs> my lords the only advice i believe that i can offer anyone visiting these establishments is to have a good bath afterwards <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know about that <e> <s> but this week it might be so <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said we do not comment on specific reports of this nature <e> <s> if i were to follow the path that the noble lord suggests i might be doing just that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is allowing his imagination to run away with him <e>", "<cs> my lords because as i have now said twice or three times we do not comment on specific reports of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i doubt that anything i could say in response to this question would have any effect upon the relations between mr gorbachev and president reagan <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i should like to repeat in the form of a statement the reply to a private notice question on severe weather payments being given in another place by my honourable friend the minister of state for social security <e> <s> the answer is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be allowed to answer both the noble lord and the noble baroness <e> <s> nobody disagrees that the present provision has some difficulties and that is why it has already been announced that the whole matter is being looked at <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly hope that nobody will be worse off as the noble lord puts it <e> <s> indeed under the new arrangements which i emphasise are a matter for local adjudication officers and not for the government i hope that the system will work better than it did last year when it came under such criticism particularly from the social security commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i should perhaps make it clear that the poorest and coldest people as the noble baroness refers to them are of course those who are already receiving supplementary benefit and a heating addition which will range from up to or so depending on the particular circumstances and the kind of house in which they live <e> <s> when the particularly severe weather comes they will now be entitled where the local adjudication officer so decides to the additional payment <e> <s> if they are living in a house which is fitted with a slot meter for example they can go immediately to their social security office and get the additional payments to which they are entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that my noble friend was responsible for the arrangements to which he referred and i can assure him that the new flexibility to which i have referred in the original answer is of course moving in the direction to which he has pointed <e> <s> but i think that everybody agrees that the present arrangements and particularly the arrangements that applied last year are less than satisfactory <e> <s> that is why this additional study is taking place and why i hope that by this time next year a better system will exist <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the eligibility for these special payment arrangements to which i have referred occurs when the claimant goes to replace his fuel stocks after a period of exceptionally severe weather but if i have misunderstood the arrangements and i confess i might have done i shall hasten to reply to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the notes of guidance are already in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt what are in the library are the notes of guidance issued to local offices <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only say again that we are continuing to consider the provision very carefully in the light of the commissioners decision and will re-assess the situation in the light of its operation this winter <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i think we certainly know better than the labour party if the noble lord will forgive me for saying so <e> <s> however perhaps i can do no better than to quote sir terence beckett who is <e>", "<cs> my lords i most strongly agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i most readily agree that overall the level of unemployment is much too high and in some parts of the country tragically high <e> <s> but the fact remains that in recent months a great number of new jobs have been created and industrial output which is perhaps the key to the solution of these problems is also rising quite effectively <e>", "<cs> my lords the way to restore our fortunes in this area is to ensure that modern and new industries are given every possible encouragement to grow <e> <s> the solution does not lie in propping up old and inefficient industries <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord well knows that i cannot anticipate what the budget will contain <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i said the cbi had changed its view in the way that the noble lord suggests <e> <s> what i have reported is the latest outcome of the cbis findings <e> <s> as the noble lord may know the cbi conducts its inquiries on a regular basis and updates them in between the regular surveys <e> <s> the words that i gave related to its latest update <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord tends to focus upon the facts that he thinks support his case <e> <s> but the fact is that output rose by per cent <e> <s> in and per cent <e> <s> in <e> <s> it has now risen by per cent <e> <s> since june and uninterruptedly indeed since <e> <s> investment in rose by per cent <e> <s> profitability in was up by per cent <e> <s> and i could go on <e>", "<cs> my lords i forgot to mention the rise in productivity which is per cent <e> <s> since <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already said in answer to the noble lord lord blyton how much i regret the figures of unemployment not only across the nation in general but specifically in the area to which both noble lords have referred <e> <s> that is why it is necessary for us to regenerate modern industries that can take on people who are looking for work in a productive and satisfactory way <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have in front of me the position with regard to the particular mine to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> of course it is necessary that whatever activity they are involved in is done in an effective and cost-effective way <e>", "<cs> my lords about jobs have been created in the last year or so and the cbi forecast an overall increase of about jobs in each of the years and <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not able to listen to all mr gorbachevs speech yesterday but i understand that the russians have indicated they would prefer a substantive rather than a quick reply to their recent communication <e> <s> of course we have to consult thoroughly with our allies and i expect that my right honourable friend will be in a position to reply soon <e>", "<cs> my lords it is of course the case that our nuclear deterrent has kept the peace in europe at least since the second world war <e> <s> that is the situation which is sometimes lost on those opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords we do acknowledge that there are some new elements in mr gorbachevs proposals but there are also some ambiguities and inconsistencies and some familiar difficulties <e> <s> they will all need careful study <e>", "<cs> my lords that was a thought which had occurred to me but i suspect that it strays a little far from the question <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord knows the united states consults very closely with its western allies in connection with the various bilateral discussions it is having with the soviet union <e> <s> in regard to mr gorbachevs letter to my right honourable friend the noble lord may have noticed that the demand for british and french weapons to be counted in compensation has been dropped though there are some equally unacceptable no-transfer and no-build-up conditions which we shall have to consider as well <e>", "<cs> my lords the british government have always made it clear that we support the objective of general and complete disarmament not just nuclear disarmament <e> <s> but the noble lord is quite right particularly with regard to the balance of intermediate range weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords that strays a little far if the noble lord will forgive my saying so from the question on the order paper <e> <s> the noble lord who has just spoken was referring to the numbers of nuclear weapons presently in place and i replied in the affirmative particularly so far as intermediate range weapons are concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall continue to support balanced and verifiable proposals in respect of disarmament but particularly where they contribute to rather than detract from our security <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i should like to repeat a statement that is being made in another place by my honourable friend the minister of state for foreign and commonwealth <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their response to the statement <e> <s> i should like to mention two ways in which we are helping and will help the philippines <e> <s> we have already a small technical co-operation programme worth about in <e> <s> we stand ready to discuss our programme of assistance with the new government of president aquino <e> <s> more important perhaps we have fully supported the package of assistance amounting to some million special drawing rights which the imf is providing for the philippines and we look forward to a continuing beneficial relationship between the international financial community and the philippines government <e>", "<cs> my lords i would naturally agree with the last sentiment expressed by the noble viscount <e> <s> but he is right to say that it is a matter of considerable satisfaction that it was possible for the filipino people to overcome the obvious shortcomings in their recent election with the minimum of violence and death to which the statement referred and which the noble lord has underlined <e> <s> these shortcomings were i believe very apparent to the noble lord lord mackie and his colleagues when they were in the philippines at the time of the election <e> <s> i know that the noble lord was good enough to express those misgivings to my honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will forgive me for saying so his points are not enforced by the loudness with which he mentions them <e> <s> it is nonetheless the case that the united states had and still has important interests in the philippines <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will not lose sight of that fact <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that the government have any role to play in the last part of the noble lords supplementary question <e> <s> we are however making some assistance available and i referred to that in my answer to the noble lord lord cledwyn <e>", "<cs> my lords the soviet union appears to have been the only country to congratulate mr marcos on his co-called election victory <e> <s> i dare say it must be wondering if it did the right thing <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot see how any misunderstanding could have arisen on this occasion <e> <s> this was clearly a national exercise and there was no reason to doubt that <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i have to say at the outset that the effect of these amendments is to under-mine entirely the purpose of clause and to bring us into head-on conflict with the european court of justice <e> <s> almost every speaker has expressed fears in relation to clause and in particular in relation to bringing private households into the ambit of sex discrimination legislation <e> <s> i am sure that members of the committee on all sides concur with the sentiments behind these fears <e> <s> we all agree that the sanctity of the home and the principle of respect for private life are indeed fundamental in a civilised society <e> <s> i too regret that the european commission bothered to take the united kingdom to court over the small and very reasonable gaps in our equal opportunity legislation but the european court of justice found us to have failed to implement european law <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord will be aware ever since we came into office in we have been seeking to lift the burden of regulation from small businesses <e> <s> if he will allow me to say so i think that we can claim a very considerable measure of success in that regard witness the fact that the small business sector of our economy is flourishing as almost never before <e> <s> every additional piece of legislation which applies to those small enterprises in this case we are referring to very small enterprises indeed is an added burden of which we should like to relieve them <e> <s> that is why we were unwilling to impose these constraints <e>", "<cs> it depends entirely upon what the person concerned is likely to be doing <e> <s> if he or she comes within the ambit of the provisions defined in the clause that we are discussing the sort of advertisement to which my noble friend has referred will continue to be perfectly proper <e>", "<cs> the noble lord will recall that when the european community legislation went through parliament it was explained that in certain areas the british parliament was deferring to the procedures of the european community <e> <s> this is such a case <e>", "<cs> no that is not the case <e> <s> as he noble lord will be aware that is not the way that we propose to proceed <e>", "<cs> before the noble lady withdraws the amendment may i say that there is no prospect of the government changing their view on this matter and she may prefer that the committee should reach a view on it today <e>", "<cs> i listened very carefully to my noble friend and indeed to everybody else who has spoken <e> <s> i know that my noble friend supports the principle of the clause and is anxious like me to get it right <e> <s> we are talking here about a subject of major importance employment actually within the home <e> <s> it can therefore affect everyone in this country at some stage in their life <e> <s> the wording of the clause was chosen to reconcile what the european court of justice recognised as two fundamental principles one the principle of equality between the sexes and two the principle of respect for private life <e>", "<cs> it is of course the case that the european court judgment did not specifically address this matter <e> <s> however when my noble friend lady platt raised it during the course of the second reading debate my noble friend lord young indicated a degree of sympathy and said that he would look into the matter <e> <s> i can confirm that the government are indeed sympathetic to the principle behind this proposal <e> <s> if my noble friend will withdraw her amendment then the government hope to bring forward a suitable amendment at report stage <e>", "<cs> i find myself broadly in agreement with the noble lord lord mccarthy <e> <s> the essence of my objection to this amendment remains as it was for the first amendment that we considered a few moments ago that it runs wholly counter to the judgment which the european court of justice handed down on this matter <e>", "<cs> what happens is that the matter is generally brought before the council of ministers by the european commission and ministers then consider the matter and reach a conclusion on it <e> <s> it is i know open to a particular member state to persuade the european commission to bring a matter before a particular council <e> <s> there are a number of councils as the noble lady will be aware and that is the course we prefer to follow <e>", "<cs> i do not think i have much more to say to the noble lord <e> <s> we are doing our best particularly in the area of the provisions for small firms to get the directive changed but it is not possible for us to do that unilaterally <e> <s> therefore i cannot give the noble lord any indication of how long it is likely to take <e>", "<cs> i believe that the amendment is superfluous <e> <s> if the noble lord will refer to clause he will see that it states that any expression used in the clause which is also used in the sex discrimination act shall have the same meaning as in that act <e> <s> i now refer him to the definition of employment in section of the act which reads <e>", "<cs> i have to agree that there is a certain logic in the noble lords proposal but i am afraid that i have to say that the government have not had a full opportunity to consider what he has in mind <e> <s> if he will be good enough to withdraw his amendment we can agree to return to the matter at report stage <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the noble baroness with great care but i must say also with a certain dismay <e> <s> she has drawn a picture of a world where years after the sex discrimination and equal pay acts came into force trade unions and employers are knowingly parties to discriminatory collective agreements and are not prepared or are not able to do anything about it until an outside body the cac tells them what to do <e> <s> i hope that this is not the case <e> <s> the noble baroness knows a good deal more about trade unions than i do <e> <s> perhaps she will be able to tell me why trade unions are signing up collective agreements that provide for unlawful discrimination against their members or if the agreements are old ones left over from before why they have not been changed during the last years <e>", "<cs> we have nothing against the cac but i believe that we are at risk of over-egging the pudding in this particular matter <e> <s> as is common ground between us the industrial tribunals already have a role to play here and as the noble baroness lady lockwood reminded us so does the equal opportunities commission <e> <s> so what we are discussing is whether there should be a third channel for these problems <e>", "<cs> i hear what the noble baroness says and i know that she has great experience in these matters <e> <s> the industrial tribunal will take very seriously the observations which the equal opportunities commission makes to them as indeed will all responsible employers and all responsible trade unions <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady seear began by saying that i was something of a polymath <e> <s> if she will forgive me for saying so so is she <e> <s> she too appears on many topics greatly i was going to say to the benefit of your lordships <e>", "<cs> i stand corrected <e> <s> the noble lord lord wedderburn recited a great number of legislative provisions that have applied to this matter down the ages and explained i think that there was a major inquiry or an inquiry of some sort at least ahead of almost every one of the measures to which he referred <e> <s> he referred too in very complimentary tones to my late right honourable friend mr baldwin or did he become my late noble friend <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that we have not plucked this provision out of the air just like that <e> <s> we are following the recommendations of the equal opportunities commission in their report called <e>", "<cs> i think i am right in saying that at the outset of his remarks the noble lord lord mccarthy referred to a number of other amendments <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord does so if that is what he decides to do i suggest to him that he is not comparing like with like <e> <s> everybody understands that in the case of a shop and the noble lord has relied almost exclusively upon this argument if it is decided to open it on a sunday then open on a sunday it will and the staff will be there to serve if required <e>", "<cs> as has been said before our purpose in clause of this bill has been to remove outdated restrictions on the hours of work of women employed on manual work in factories and industrial undertakings <e> <s> what this amendment proposes is that we should continue with some of these restrictions but that the employment of women at night should be <e>", "<cs> the mines and quarries act contains a number of provisions which place restrictions on the hours and times that women may work above ground <e> <s> women are not of course permitted to be employed below ground <e> <s> section of the act restricts the hours that may be worked to <e>", "<cs> once again i am pleased to see that the noble lord has come part of the way with us and <e>", "<cs> as the committee will know under the existing provisions of the factories act the health and safety executive can issue special exemption orders that enable women to work outside the hours normally prohibited <e> <s> before doing so the hse must be satisfied that the wishes of the workpeople have been taken into account <e> <s> but that is not the only means by which the normal restrictions can be varied <e> <s> section of the act also is concerned with authorising shift working involving hours that would otherwise be prohibited and that section goes further than general consultation providing that except in the case of newly-established factories the majority of the workpeople concerned must have agreed to that pattern of working by means of a secret ballot <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i recognise that my noble friend speaking from the particular point of experience and authority that she does feels strongly <e> <s> the amendment presents us with difficulties <e> <s> the governments general views on this matter were deployed at an earlier stage this evening on similar amendments <e> <s> however i give her an assurance that if she agrees to withdraw the amendment i shall happily receive her between now and the report stage of the bill to discuss the matter further or if she would prefer ask one of my noble or right honourable friends to receive her in the department of employment to discuss the point <e>", "<cs> that is entirely a matter for my noble friend <e> <s> if she chooses not to speak now may i reply to the amendment proposed by the noble baroness <e> <s> clause of the bill aims to repeal as the noble baroness understands the baking industry hours of work act <e> <s> that act is framed to apply only to male bakery workers and makes specific reference to the exclusion from its scope of women and young people whose hours are regulated by the factories act <e> <s> if the act continued to control mens hours in baking while those provisions in the act dealing with womens hours of work were repealed a discriminatory anomaly would arise <e> <s> mens hours would continue to be controlled but it would be entirely open to employers and their workforces to negotiate whatever hours of work for female employees they saw fit <e> <s> this would clearly be nonsense <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> the trouble was that it was not possible to reach a sensible collective bargain in this matter and that is why legislation had to be introduced as the basis upon which a collective bargain could be agreed <e> <s> if we had to introduce legislation for every collective bargain that now exists in british industry we should be very busy indeed <e>", "<cs> i do not really have very much more to say to my noble friend in addition to my remarks on the earlier amendment on this topic <e> <s> however let me just say this <e> <s> the special provisions which we are now seeking to repeal with regard to the bakery industry are as my noble friend lord mottistone has said unique to the baking industry <e> <s> that is not quite correct <e> <s> i must not exaggerate the position <e> <s> the noble lord lord wedderburn referred to the sheet glass industry in his earlier remarks and i am advised that there is indeed certain statutory provision with regard to their hours of work but that is a different matter because i am told that that particular provision stems from a certain international agreement which places an obligation upon us to have that legislation in place <e> <s> of course that is not the case so far as the bakery industry is concerned <e>", "<cs> i have made it clear that this provision applies to the baking industry alone <e> <s> this special protection which the noble baroness is seeking is for the baking industry alone and i do not think that that is right or proper <e> <s> if i could follow the remarks of the noble baroness lady lockwood the one option we do not have i suggest is to do nothing because that would mean that the employment of men was controlled in the baking industry but not of women <e> <s> that is not i think the arrangement she wants <e>", "<cs> i hope your lordships will forgive me if i do not reply at the same length as the noble lord in introducing his remarks <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that clause of the bill repeals the baking industry hours of work act <e> <s> the act as the noble lord well knows covers the manufacture of all bread and flour confectionery but excludes biscuits <e> <s> women are excluded from the act being generally prohibited from night work by the factories legislation at which we have already looked under clause <e>", "<cs> what we propose in clause of this bill is the removal of restrictions on the hours of work of women employed in manual work in factories because they are discriminatory and we believe outdated and an unnecessary burden on employers and the health and safety executive <e> <s> what is proposed in this amendment is that these limited restrictions should be replaced with a code of practice which will provide guidance on the hours of work for all employees <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend will forgive me if i say that i think that this amendment is rather taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut <e> <s> it is entirely usual practice for departments to issue guidance on new legislation <e> <s> the department of employment invariably issues free leaflets and booklets which are widely available through jobcentres unemployment benefit offices and small firms centres round the country <e> <s> there is every intention to issue guidance on the changes to the sex discrimination act contained in the bill before us now including of course the changes affecting collective agreements <e> <s> the committee may recall that my noble friend the secretary of state at the second reading of this bill undertook to ensure that simplified explanatory guidance would be made available to help small firms come to grips with their new obligations when the bill comes into force <e> <s> i can also assure my noble friend that the equal opportunities commission will be given the chance to make its usual constructive comments on the new explanatory material <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> i assure my noble friend that we intend to follow the normal practice in this case <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if i did not make myself clear earlier <e> <s> i said that that point would be covered <e>", "<cs> my lords the reply which my right honourable friend gave to mr gorbachev had of course to take into account the proposition that we cannot be persuaded to accept proposals which would detract from rather than contribute to our security <e> <s> as for the position of the british medical association i think the noble lord referred to them responsibility for defence policy rests with her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has underlined the answers i gave earlier but i would of course add that the united kingdom is a member of the north atlantic alliance and we have the benefit of that membership with the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that there are a number of views along the lines that the noble lord offers <e> <s> the scope report was in fact published in two volumes <e> <s> i understand that volume was published at the end of last year and for some curious reason we await volume <e>", "<cs> my lords i dare say that that will happen but the governments position remains that nuclear weapons do indeed make an important contribution to peace now and i dare say in the future as they have for the past -odd years <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i agree that it would be desirable to create a balance at a lower level of nuclear weapons on both sides but i do not think that we can approach that position by unbalanced or unverifiable changes as some advocate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that we have not yet had a chance to come to a view on the scope report but we look forward to seeing it in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to reply to this debate i am conscious of the fact that i have about one and one-quarter hours in which to effect my reply <e> <s> however your lordships may prefer it if i contain my remarks within a rather shorter period <e>", "<cs> my lords i read out the assurance that we gave at the time which of course referred to not using nuclear weapons against a non-nuclear power except in certain denned circumstances <e> <s> i think that our possession of nuclear weapons which serves as a deterrent not only against those who do not have them but more importantly against those who do has served us well over the years <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may take first the first of the noble lords supplementary questions where he referred to the threshold test ban and the peaceful nuclear explosion treaties i understand that the united states wishes to carry out or achieve better verification provisions for those treaties before they can move ahead and i can well understand its anxiety in that respect <e> <s> but the united states has indicated that those measures such as <e>", "<cs> my lords the soviet union has indicated that it would be willing under certain conditions as i understand it to accept observers of soviet nuclear tests but apparently the proposal is tied in a way which is not entirely clear to united states prior acceptance of the moratorium <e> <s> that is a matter with which we should have some difficulty for reasons which the noble lord will understand <e> <s> we have made clear in the past as i endeavoured to make clear in the main answer to the question this afternoon that declaratory gestures such as the moratorium which the soviet union has been proposing are without value while they are not properly verifiable <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always difficult to get to the bottom of exactly what the soviet union is proposing because it keeps on attaching conditions to whatever is proposed <e> <s> the fact remains that the united states proposal to which the noble lord lord brockway referred where president reagan invited observers to watch an american nuclear test was without conditions of any kind <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the government position on this matter is that we should like to see the verification problems addressed before the negotiations are resumed <e> <s> we do not think there will be much point in negotiations while these problems loom large and have not been solved <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the limited unilateral and indeed declaratory gesture to which i have referred is any substitute for a long-term durable agreement <e> <s> that durability will be achieved by resolving the problems not by sweeping them under the carpet <e>", "<cs> my lords what the noble lord has in mind would be a meeting of technical experts for example to address the problems of verification which are not inconsiderable and the government would support that <e>", "<cs> my lords there is really no point in entering into an agreement where there is scope for widespread cheating <e> <s> that must remain the position while it is not possible to verify the effective compliance with such an agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the most important risk of a misunderstanding of british policy would have been to have voted in favour of a resolution with the shortcomings that i have referred to <e> <s> it is all very well identifying the problem but we need to seek a solution as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the way forward in the lebanon is for the lebanese government and people to be allowed to solve their own problems without outside interference from wherever it comes <e>", "<cs> my lords our problems with the resolution went a little wider than the noble lord is suggesting <e> <s> it did not point the way forward to a solution in this area and we look forward very much <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord that goes a little wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> nevertheless her majestys government will support any constructive proposals in this area <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that one of the major obstacles in the way of unifil properly fulfilling its mandate is the continued israeli presence in the south of lebanon and i hope that that matter can be corrected very soon <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is right if i may say so to point to the need for these resolutions to be balanced <e> <s> the one which is the subject of this question failed for example to pay proper regard to israeli security concerns and those of lebanon <e> <s> those are among the reasons why we were obliged not to vote <e>", "<cs> my lords if israeli interests are concerned with unifil fulfilling its mandate then perhaps they could help them to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not in a position to give the noble lord the sort of sweeping assurance that he asks for <e> <s> however i can assure him that the surveys will be quite up to the mark <e>", "<cs> my lords i should perhaps point out that the museum authorities were advised as far back as that the lease would not be renewed when it expired in and a one-year extension was granted to provide time for alternative arrangements to be made <e> <s> that was until august <e> <s> it is now nearly a year after that and still no future arrangements have been made <e> <s> having said that i am aware of the strong feeling that has been expressed and although this is a responsibility for the northern ireland office and not for the ministry of defence i shall undertake to see what can be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise that strong feelings are held on this matter but perhaps i may be permitted to point out that among the places that have been suggested for the th royal inniskilling dragoon guards museum is enniskillen castle which would i should have thought have been rather suitable <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter for the northern ireland office <e> <s> i understand that the castle is required by the local authority <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am not sure that i quite follow the drift of the noble lords supplementary question but i have said that i recognise the strong feelings that are held and i shall undertake to see what can be done <e>", "<cs> my lords let me say at the outset that the government strongly support this bill and very much hope that it will shortly find its place on the statute book <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord the question on the order paper refers to a document issued by the labour party and i do not think that his supplementary question arises from that <e>", "<cs> my lords again i do not think that that arises from the question that i have answered <e>", "<cs> my lords that i believe is self-evident <e> <s> however there are a number of contradictory features in the document to which i have referred <e>", "<cs> my lords the document which is the subject of the question contains a number of contradictions which i have no doubt will become apparent to noble lords opposite if they ever again come into power <e>", "<cs> my lords again that question goes very wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> we made an announcement very recently about the current projected cost of trident <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be worth mentioning that the right honourable gentleman to whom the noble lord refers is i think the only member of the present shadow cabinet who has held high office in a defence department <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the labour party is wrong if it imagines that it can replace nuclear deterrents with conventional deterrents at the same level of deterrence at the same cost <e> <s> my noble friend is right to point out that that is not remotely possible <e> <s> that presents us with some difficulty because the labour party apparently thinks that it will fund all the other improvements that it plans at the expense of the defence budget <e> <s> as it is forecasting a total of something like million of extra expenditure there will be some difficulty for it <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that the document is wide-ranging and it would take me a long time to recite all its shortcomings <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter which we have discussed on a number of occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that the soviet union would greatly appreciate the phasing out of the british independent nuclear deterrent because it would contribute to its security but not to ours <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the case that ever since the second world war the labour party has supported the maintenance of an independent british nuclear deterrent and that is why its present stance is so curious <e>", "<cs> my lords i return to the point which i made earlier that mr healey is by far and away the most experienced in these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords yes indeed it has been discussed by me in fact with at least one of the companies concerned <e> <s> also perhaps more importantly it has been discussed with the trade association the association of offshore diving contractors as i think they are called <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure to which agreement the noble lord is referring but if he is referring to what i think was the earliest exchange between governments on this matter that between ambassadors on th april i shall happily place a copy in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot anticipate what our reaction to some future request from the united states would be <e> <s> it would depend upon the circumstances at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly admit to a degree of disappointment over european action hitherto <e> <s> i understand that the ministers are meeting again today <e> <s> let us hope that something better emerges <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the arrangements to which the noble lord is referring were succinctly repeated in the communiqu which was issued on th january with which the noble lord is no doubt familiar <e>", "<cs> my lords the matter to which the noble lord referred is one for the prime minister and the president of the day but those arrangements have stood the test of time very well <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that the governments views are as represented by the prime minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i really cannot anticipate what the prime ministers reaction to a hypothetical situation would be but if the circumstances were appropriate she would agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i have an image of woman police constable fletcher lying dead in st jamess square <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as nuclear weapons are concerned i am afraid that the noble lord is mistaken <e> <s> the position is as i have described it <e>", "<cs> no my lords the position is as i have said on a number of occasions <e> <s> no nuclear weapon will ever be fired or launched from british territory without the agreement of the british prime minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i do not share the doubts of the noble lord <e> <s> the arrangements to which i have referred are reviewed each time a new president or prime minister comes into office <e> <s> they have consistently been found satisfactory including if i may so so on the occasion that prime ministers from the labour party came into office <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble lord is not entitled to see them <e> <s> they are highly classified <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no need for the government to put that question to the american administration as the noble lord suggests because the americans too have confirmed the understanding to which i have referred <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me to impugn the motives of the noble lord opposite but the answers to the questions he has put to me are the ones i have given <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will forgive me for intervening but i understand that he is not in order to quote a back-bencher in another place <e>", "<cs> order <e>", "<cs> my lords during the debate your lordships have rightly referred to the long and proud history of service that the royal dockyards have for centuries given to the royal navy <e> <s> there has also been mention of the high standards of workmanship in the dockyards and of the loyalty of the dockyard workforce <e> <s> i echo those sentiments <e> <s> however as i said in my opening remarks what we have to consider now is the future <e> <s> it is our aim that when the dockyards have settled down under a system of commercial management they may be able to look forward to a secure future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am greatly obliged to both noble lords for their constructive contributions to this debate and above all for giving me some indication of the points that they will wish to raise when we come to a later stage of the bill <e> <s> forewarned is forearmed and i look forward to debating their amendments with them when the time comes <e> <s> in the meantime i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of terrorism <e>", "<cs> my lords there is of course more than one body of foreign troops in lebanon <e> <s> we certainly think that the people of lebanon should be allowed to decide their own future <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may deal with the first of the noble lords points we hope that the kabul regime and its soviet backers will now cease prevaricating so far as the talks in geneva are concerned and agree to a satisfactory un timetable for the withdrawal of soviet troops which is the crucial issue now being discussed and then implement it forthwith <e> <s> in regard to the position <e>", "<cs> my lords that sounds a rather catch-all supplementary question if i may say so and i should want to consider the exact implications of it before giving the noble lord the assurance that he wants <e> <s> but he will well understand that we disagree with unlawful occupation wherever it may occur <e>", "<cs> my lords our view is that the new regime in kabul is no better than the previous one a ramshackle collection of rogues with no claim to legitimacy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i have to tell the noble lord that the position in the middle east is a good deal more complicated than the one in afghanistan which was a patent example if ever there was one of naked aggression <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that the prospects of some progress so far as afghanistan is concerned are wholly dependent upon our doing something as the noble lord says <e> <s> as the noble lord lord cledwyn mentioned just now there has been a little progress in the talks in geneva and i hope that they will come to a successful conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords i dare say that the noble lord is right in his historical analysis but how far i can apply those precepts to the present is another matter <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i shall now repeat a statement being made in another place by my honourable friend the minister of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs about the request by her majestys government to the syrian government to withdraw three members of the syrian embassy from london <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to both noble lords <e> <s> there was no real mystery about the remarks towards the end of the statement to which the noble lord lord mcnair referred <e> <s> what was being considered was a response to the expulsion of the three british diplomats from damascus <e> <s> we are considering whether that calls for any further reaction from us <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is of course posing a purely hypothetical question <e> <s> at this stage nothing is proved <e>", "<cs> my lords we have made clear on a number of occasions our concern about continuing reports of syrian provision of facilities for the abu nidal group to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> the syrians have assured us that they do not support abu nidals terrorist activities <e>", "<cs> my lords i have heard those allegations but i am not in a position to comment upon them <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no need to proceed as the noble lord suggests because as i have said on a number of occasions the effect of present arrangements is that no nuclear weapon will ever be fired from british facilities without the agreement of the british prime minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i reject the proposition that recent events have done other than wholly endorse the satisfactory arrangements now in place <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as i know there are no nuclear weapons in this country subject to physical dual control <e> <s> the answer as to why they are not is that the alternative existing arrangements are entirely satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords any deployment of chemical weapons to the united kingdom at any time would require the consent of her majestys government <e> <s> if such a request were ever to be received it would be a matter for decision by the british government of the day in the light of all the circumstances prevailing at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that such weapons would be brought here in a time of crisis <e> <s> that would be a matter for the government of the day and i am afraid that i am not in a position to bind future governments or for that matter to bind the present government in regard to what is a hypothetical situation <e>", "<cs> my lords the view of the government on this matter has been reflected on a number of occasions and during a number of debates notably in your lordships house <e> <s> the essence of government policy is to ensure a worldwide ban on these weapons and we are working to that end in geneva <e>", "<cs> my lords the policy of the british government remains exactly as it was when i referred to this matter earlier in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord imagines that he will be a member of some future government and wants to accept conservative government policy in advance i should be happy to agree with him <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that we have received no request from the united states government along the lines hypothecated by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords no i do not believe that any such agreement has been reached in nato <e> <s> i understand that what has happened is that a draft force goal has been agreed to but that it has yet to be agreed by nato defence ministers <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall be supporting that defence goal <e>", "<cs> my lords i refer the noble lord to my written answer on th may when i told him that there have been no such agreements with the united states government <e> <s> the content and introduction of any emergency powers would be for consideration by the government and parliament of the day having regard to all the circumstances at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords the question on the order paper tabled by the noble lord suggests that there has been some agreement with the united states government to confer certain powers upon them under certain circumstances <e> <s> i said then and i say now that there is no such agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite correct <e> <s> any responsible government will want to consider the appropriate powers that they ought to take in times of great tension crisis or war <e>", "<cs> my lords i was once told that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only assure the noble lord again that there is no agreement or arrangement to confer the sort of powers that are referred to in the noble lords question upon the united states government or any other government <e>", "<cs> my lords experience leads me to suppose that to anticipate the views of the united states congress or for that matter the british parliament in a hypothetical situation would be unwise <e> <s> but on the earlier part of the noble lords observation i am happy to feel that in any future conflict which i hope will not occur we shall have the support of the united states and our nato allies <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> it is perhaps a pity that the noble lord lord mayhew was not in his place when this debate started because he would then have learned that the noble and learned lord lord denning did not for a moment agree with the noble lord lord graham <e> <s> indeed the noble and learned lord was right to point to some of the difficulties and complexities of this matter <e>", "<cs> if i may be allowed to answer the noble lord on that point the study that is going on and the documents which will flow from it will be in the nature of advice to ministers <e> <s> as the noble lord will appreciate advice to ministers is not normally published <e> <s> however having said that we shall certainly want to give as much information as possible about our decision when we reach it and the basis upon which we reach that decision <e> <s> i do not think the noble lord will have any cause for complaint about the quantity of information we shall make available at that time <e>", "<cs> such information as i have so far on this matter leads me to understand that this is a much more complicated matter than we had at first imagined <e> <s> when it comes to announcing some conclusion and i am afraid that i cannot be specific on when that will be i think the conclusion will be fairly straightforward <e> <s> it will be either to abolish the present arrangements to repeal the present protection that the ministry of defence and the armed forces enjoy in this matter or to leave matters more or less where they are <e> <s> although there are a number of compromise possibilities that have been canvassed they too present enormous complexities and difficulties <e> <s> for that reason they are not particularly attractive <e>", "<cs> i say at once that we take this matter very seriously <e> <s> the services draw their recruits from society as a whole and they do therefore to some extent reflect the trends in that society <e> <s> thus they cannot hope entirely to escape problems such as drug and alcohol abuse <e> <s> so far as alcohol abuse is concerned the statistics are not readily available but there is no evidence that alcoholism is a significantly greater problem in the services than in society generally <e> <s> statistics on drug abuse are carefully monitored and i am glad to say that at this stage drug abuse is not considered to be a major problem <e>", "<cs> i want to stress right at the outset that discrimination by members of the armed forces on any grounds whether of race religion colour or anything else during dealings with other servicemen or with members of the public would not be tolerated <e> <s> if it were to take place it would be viewed extremely seriously and dealt with accordingly <e> <s> service law already contains a number of offences under which racial or religious discrimination would be an offence wherever it took place <e> <s> any conduct to the prejudice of good order and discipline under which any act of racial or religious discrimination would fall is an offence <e>", "<cs> may i say at the outset that i do not have all that information in front of me but i shall be happy to try to find it and let the noble lord have it <e> <s> that means that a copy of my letter to the noble lord will go automatically to the library <e>", "<cs> i think the aim of the noble lords amendment is to remove the statutory provision which enables homosexual practices on the part of members of the armed forces to be charged as offences against the service discipline acts <e> <s> at present the position is that under the services discipline acts all homosexual practices involving service personnel continue to be offences regardless of the sex age or willing consent of those involved <e> <s> section of the sexual offences act which otherwise permitted sexual acts between consenting adult males in private specifically reserves the position <e>", "<cs> i am afraid not <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is wrong <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that the noble lords intention in putting down this amendment is to bring service law into line with the provisions which apply to the prosecution of offences in england and wales <e> <s> as the noble lord made clear his amendment is based very closely on section of the prosecution of offences act <e> <s> that section enabled the home secretary to make regulations concerning time limits for trial in the civilian criminal courts in england and wales <e> <s> it was an entirely new departure since previously there had been no provision to apply time limits of this nature <e> <s> in this respect the general <e>", "<cs> i was planning to deal with both the points made by my noble friend lady faithfull who spoke to the amendment of the noble lord lord graham and subsequently to the question whether clause stand part <e> <s> if the committee agrees i shall now reply to both propositions during the course of my remarks <e>", "<cs> i am not entirely certain in what context my noble friend asks that question but perhaps i may look into the matter and let her know if i have anything to add <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has made clear the objective of his amendment is to ensure that one of the members of a court martial should be someone other than an officer where those of below commissioned rank are being tried <e> <s> although the conclusion of the lewis committee was that to widen the composition of courts martial to include those below commissioned rank would neither tend to <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may answer my noble friend first before dealing specifically with these amendments <e> <s> may i say that that is a matter which falls slightly outside the scope of this amendment <e> <s> if my noble friend will allow me i shall get the precise information and write to her as soon as i can <e>", "<cs> my trouble is that listening to the speech of the noble lord lord graham i could not quite make out to what part of the long title his speech referred <e> <s> then turning up the standing orders with the help of the clerk i find that amendments must be relevant to the subject matter of the bill and to the clause in respect of which they are proposed <e> <s> it further says that they must not be inconsistent with the previous decision of the committee on the same question <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has said his amendment seeks to empower all courts martial and standing civilian courts to call for social inquiry reports to be made <e> <s> although he has not included in his proposed clause a definition of the phrase social inquiry report i assume he means a report prepared by a social worker containing all relevant personal information on an offender to enable the court to decide upon the most appropriate sentence taking into account the individuals circumstances <e>", "<cs> we are approaching the end of four hours consideration of this committee stage and i know there is other business to follow <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will therefore forgive me if i do not speak at any great length <e>", "<cs> on the amendment that he has now proposed <e> <s> but needless to say i share the view of the noble lord lord mayhew that this is not an appropriate amendment and i hope that the noble lord will not seek to press it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure what has been agreed for future stages of this bill but since no amendments have been agreed to today it would be open to me to move now that this report be now received <e> <s> i should be grateful for the views of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i know there are no plans for any significant change in the figures that i have given <e> <s> of course from time to time construction work is carried out at american facilities in this country and that obviously requires the employment of a number of british personnel <e>", "<cs> my lords united kingdom forces of course spend money in germany and elsewhere but that was not the question that i was asked <e>", "<cs> my lords the proposition that there should be a significant expansion of united kingdom armed forces is not one that i have heard before from the noble lord if he will allow me to say so <e> <s> if united states forces were not present in europe that would be a serious matter indeed <e> <s> they make a crucial contribution to the nato alliance in europe <e> <s> the total number of united states forces in europe is in excess of <e> <s> i am not sure that the noble lord had in mind an expansion on that scale of united kingdom armed forces <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that that wholly arises from the question on the order paper <e> <s> i shall nonetheless say that the united states presence in this country is very welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their response and for their kind words about me personally <e> <s> the noble lord lord graham and i shall deal with as many of his points as i can asked who was to blame <e> <s> i think that the statement made clear that we do not seek to apportion blame in this situation <e> <s> i think that the principal difficulty arose from the ambiguity of the queens regulation to which i referred in the course of the statement <e> <s> there was undoubtedly room for more than one respectable interpretation of that queens regulation <e> <s> that is why as the statement says it has been withdrawn for the time being and will be reissued if necessary after due consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his kind personal words <e> <s> it is indeed the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for that intervention and also for his personal words <e> <s> the noble and learned lord asked specifically about the availability of advice to the young men concerned <e> <s> i do not think i can do other than remind your lordships that this was an inquiry of the greatest difficulty <e> <s> it was clear to the investigators that a major breach of security had occurred and they clearly saw it as their duty to conduct themselves in the light of that belief <e> <s> indeed it was because of that belief that the need to know principle was applied to a considerable extent to those who were responsible for their custody and for other <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that your lordships would want to regard this afternoon as an opportunity for a review of the official secrets act <e> <s> there are of course a number of views held on that matter and i do not propose to make a contribution to such a discussion this afternoon nor could i add to the view of the court which of course was that the defendants were not guilty <e>", "<cs> my lords i can tell my noble friend that four of the servicemen concerned lance corporal glass signalman hardman signalman tuffy and senior aircraftman payne have already left the services on completion of their engagements <e> <s> none asked for his engagement to be extended <e> <s> a fifth <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i am able to make any useful contribution to the details of the investigation of this matter now so long ago <e> <s> as for the contribution of the metropolitan police special branch they are not of course within the purview of the ministry of defence <e> <s> in any event so far as i know no complaints were made concerning their aspect of the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the view of the government of the united states and of course the other governments involved in this matter is well known and has been made clear on a number of occasions <e> <s> as for the position of noraid as the noble lord will be aware it apparently claims to be raising money only for the welfare of republican prisoners and their families <e> <s> however eight members of noraid and office holders have been convicted of gun running to the ira in the united states since <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i am in a position to comment on the detailed figures that the noble lord has given but like him i have read the reports and i dare say that there is a good deal of truth in them <e> <s> but i am clear that the united states government are doing everything they can to halt the illegal activities of these organisations because i believe there is more than one <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that there is clear evidence that libya has provided the provisional ira with money and weapons though i have no figures on the precise amounts <e> <s> but my noble friend may be interested to know that the major find of arms at sligo and roscommon in the irish republic on the th january this year included rifles and ammunition from libya <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will be aware that is now a matter for the united states senate <e> <s> the view of the united states government however is clear <e> <s> they have made it absolutely clear that they want to see the treaty approved <e> <s> indeed the president of the united states recently made a broadcast to that effect <e>", "<cs> yes my lords it is certainly the case that they have been conducting many successful operations in this area <e>", "<cs> my lords we are clear that the united states government are doing everything in their power to stop the flow of illegal funds and arms across the atlantic <e> <s> but so far as the treaty is concerned the president of the united states is no <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i should much assist your lordships by drawing analogies of the kind that the noble lord suggests <e> <s> the position is that the united kingdom has signed a treaty with the united states government on this matter and as the noble lord will know under the american constitution treaties of that kind have to be approved by the senate <e> <s> it is that approval that we are now looking forward to <e>", "<cs> my lords nobody more than i shares the thoughts behind the views of the noble lord <e> <s> but it is necessary to proceed in a more measured way <e> <s> as i have said before i am clear that the united states government are doing everything in their power to get this treaty approved <e>", "<cs> my lords there was one time in my life when as a junior minister in the foreign office i had specific responsibility for the matter to which the noble baroness refers <e> <s> i can assure her that such matters engage ministers continuous attention <e>", "<cs> that sounds to me an entirely proper way to proceed although i am of course in the hands of the committee <e> <s> returning to the amendment that i moved the purpose of the amendment and those that go with it is to require military vessels to be individually designated for protection under the bill rather than being automatically protected as a class <e> <s> the bill as originally drafted makes it an offence to interfere with all aircraft and vessels that crashed sank or were stranded while in the service of the armed forces unless they have been removed from the protection of the bill by the issue of a licence <e> <s> this kind of blanket protection is essential in the case of those military aircraft that were lost without trace in the second world war and the remains of which have still not been found <e> <s> in some cases we have no idea whether they lie on the seabed or are buried in british or foreign soil <e> <s> since their location and in the case of foreign military aircraft their identity is not known they cannot be individually designated for protection <e>", "<cs> i think i am replying to at least two amendments but i shall do my best <e> <s> perhaps i may deal first with the amendment of my noble friend lord onslow <e> <s> as i understand it what lay at the heart of my noble friends anxiety was the problem about british subjects employed for example by foreign companies who might find themselves in difficulties as a result of the bill <e>", "<cs> i understand my noble friends anxiety <e> <s> let me remind him of what i think i have said to him on more than one occasion at the various meetings we have had and i have certainly said it to those who have come to see me to express their views or reservations on this matter <e> <s> the purpose of the bill is to protect the sanctity of the war graves <e> <s> it is therefore in our interests to ensure that british firms conduct this work under the protection of a licence which we shall therefore hasten to issue in appropriate cases <e> <s> it will clearly be in our interests to ensure that a british firm has a licence to operate and does so in accordance with the provisions of the licence rather than allowing haphazard access by foreign firms which might otherwise be the case <e>", "<cs> i do not think that my noble friend has quite understood what i was saying <e> <s> the way we stop haphazard access by foreign firms is to hasten to license british firms <e>", "<cs> this amendment taken in conjunction with amendment no <e> <s> is more restrictive than the current provisions in some ways but less restrictive in others <e> <s> it would require us to consult a local authority before designating a vessel or a controlled site <e> <s> i presume the noble lord intends such consultation only where the wreck lies within a local authoritys boundary <e> <s> as he is no doubt aware this would exclude most areas within territorial waters <e> <s> this is no great imposition but we do not believe it to be necessary unless the controlled site is on land controlled by the local authority <e> <s> clause <e>", "<cs> that is not quite what i said <e> <s> i said that my department would consult the foreign office in that situation <e>", "<cs> i am totally relaxed about this amendment <e> <s> if the committee think it a good thing to treat the bill in this way i shall not object <e>", "<cs> the government do not feel strongly about retaining the words hatch or other in this subsection <e> <s> it can be argued as the noble lord has suggested that the words are unnecessary <e> <s> however as the noble lord has said it is our wish that the offence should not apply in cases where for example a person swims into a hull when most of the upper deck is missing <e> <s> i believe that the parliamentary draftsmen have done a good job in this area and although i certainly should not want to go to the stake on this i hope that on reflection the noble lord will not wish to press his amendment <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> merely stumbling across a wreckage as i endeavoured to explain earlier does not fall foul of the provisions of this bill <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has been rightly concerned about the position of british salvage companies <e> <s> i said during second reading that we were prepared to grant a licence to reputable salvage companies that would enable them to salvage cargo from designated vessels without committing an offence under the bill <e> <s> there would be an agreed code of practice designed to ensure the minimum disturbance of any human remains <e> <s> if any company disregarded the terms of this code the licence could be withdrawn <e> <s> as my noble friend has indicated there have been further discussions since second reading to settle the content of the licence and i am glad to confirm that already there appears to be broad agreement on the basic principles <e>", "<cs> on the question of an international convention i do not think i can add very much to what has been said previously <e> <s> however perhaps i can take some advice and if there is anything further to add i shall be happy to write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lord the united kingdom of course is not a party to the salt ii treaty but we can and do make our views known and will continue to do so <e> <s> as for resolving the questions which have been raised by the united states about soviet compliance it is now for the soviet union to respond to those observations <e> <s> there is a proper machinery for doing so the standing consultative commission in geneva and we look to the soviet union to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly very much hope that the united states will not depart from the salt ii limits but the way for that to be achieved would be for the soviet union to respond to the anxieties which the united states has expressed and as i said earlier there is a proper machinery for that <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of the radar to which my noble friend refers is of course not strictly relevant to the salt ii agreement but the siting and orientation of the large phased-array radar under construction there gives rise to serious questions in connection with obligations covering early warning radars in the amb treaty <e> <s> we have raised this matter with the soviet union on a number of occasions <e> <s> and clearly it will be necessary to resolve these questions if the abm treaty is to be protected from erosion and if the necessary confidence is to be created for concluding new agreements <e>", "<cs> yes my lords it is the case that the president has announced the dismantling of two poseidon submarines when he could of course have authorised their continuance in service <e> <s> he has not yet authorised an increase in the number of b alcm launch aircraft but has pointed the way in that direction if he does not get a proper response from the <e>", "<cs> my lords there have been some soviet proposals in a number of areas recently but generally speaking and i am speaking in general terms soviet proposals with regard to verification fall some way short of what is required <e>", "<cs> my lords the charges which have been made by the united states about soviet noncompliance in this area have not been answered at all by the soviet union except by a bold denial <e> <s> they will have to do better than that and we hope that they will do so <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to bring the strings of this debate together and draw it to a close i start by suggesting to your lordships that we are proposing a sensible and moderate reform that will reduce rigidities and red tape in the labour market and thereby promote jobs bring the law on the payment of wages into the twentieth century and above all help young people get their vital first foothold on the employment ladder against competition from older experienced workers <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend does not recall giving those figures but if the noble lord will draw my attention to them i will certainly give him chapter and verse <e> <s> the fact is that some figures have been proffered as to the likely effect of the total abolition of all wages councils <e> <s> that is not what is proposed under this bill and naturally it is not possible to read across from the figures that some people have suggested may apply to the total abolition scenario to the more restricted proposals now before us <e>", "<cs> my lords the doctrine that i ask your lordships to accept is the doctrine of common sense which is that if employers are obliged to pay young people wages that are higher than necessary then they will employ fewer of them <e> <s> i should have thought that stood to reason <e>", "<cs> my lords i dare say the greater the fall the greater will be the effect on the employment figures but that is not precisely the answer to the question that the noble lord has posed <e> <s> we are not anticipating a grand fall in the levels of remuneration but there will nonetheless we believe be some important benefits to the employment figures <e>", "<cs> come on <e>", "<cs> the effect of the amendment would i suggest be twofold <e> <s> it would rule out refits of nuclear submarines not only by a commercially managed dockyard company but also of course by the government-owned public limited company if for any reason that option were adopted by the government <e> <s> that cannot be either sensible or what the noble lord or any other noble lord who supports that option would actually want <e> <s> alternatively it would be necessary if the amendment were accepted either for nuclear work to be carried out by the only other contender vickers of barrow or for each dockyard to be split up with responsibility for the nuclear work remaining under direct government operation while the remainder of the work which the noble lord is not suggesting should be similarly denied to the dockyard company would be under commercial management <e>", "<cs> under this amendment the dockyards would have to be operated under a trading fund for at least two years before the provisions of the <e>", "<cs> it seemed long <e>", "<cs> it is an objective if i may say so at the outset that i very much share <e> <s> i too am greatly attracted to the notion that workers should have a share in the enterprise for which they work for all the reasons that have been enumerated this evening and on other occasions <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that this group of amendments amendments nos <e> <s> and proposed by the noble and learned lord have two propositions at their basis <e> <s> the first proposition is that because of the two-company structure that we propose the applicability of the european council directive is called into question <e> <s> i am bound to say that i do not share that view <e> <s> however for that and in particular for other reasons i have been considering as i have already indicated whether we should not look more carefully at a single company structure <e> <s> if we were to do that i think that the noble and learned lord would agree that his anxiety about the applicability of the european council directive would fall away <e>", "<cs> i am reassured to hear that <e> <s> that will certainly be one of the factors i take into account in deciding whether we should proceed in that direction <e> <s> let me say at once that i am attracted to what the noble and learned lord says about a one-company structure <e> <s> i shall be considering it in that frame of mind <e>", "<cs> if the committee will allow me to move amendment no <e> <s> and in due course accept it and if it then proves to be inappropriate we could change it when we came to change the structure arrangements if that is what is decided upon <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might explain why we have felt it right to set the length of the initial contract at each dockyard at seven years <e> <s> originally we had thought of a five-year contract but on reflection we felt that after a necessary settling-in period during which time the commercial managers would be familiarising themselves with the system making improvements in the way the dockyards operate and generally increasing efficiency for which most people feel there is ample scope the company should be allowed a full five-year period to consolidate their plans <e> <s> for our part we expect increasingly to negotiate work on a fixed price basis and we are confident that over the seven-year contract the benefits to the royal navy in terms of an improved service and to the taxpayer in terms of costs will be obvious to all <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> as is well known i think nei and the trafalgar house group together with plessey and a and p appledore have withdrawn <e>", "<cs> i am beginning to feel a little redundant because the noble and learned lord is quite right <e> <s> one that basis i hope that the noble lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> not for the first time the noble and learned lord lord denning has got it right when he told the committee that this is essentially a matter for the contract as the noble lord lord crawshaw has recognised <e> <s> the numbers will primarily be determined by the contractors and will relate to the requirements of the contract of work that they have <e> <s> they will also have to be to the satisfaction of the secretary of state <e> <s> so if the contractors try to use too few then the secretary of state will clearly prevail <e>", "<cs> the ultimate sanction in the possession of the ministry of defence is to terminate the contract although i am not suggesting that that would be the right course on a comparatively small matter <e> <s> i do not think there will be any difficulty <e> <s> i am sure that the governments view is shared throughout the committee that we should have the maximum number of apprentices that we can afford and are appropriate <e> <s> there will be additional apprentices in the dockyards for eventual work in other parts of the ministry of defence who will be paid for separately under the contractual arrangements to which i have referred <e> <s> in addition to the terms of the contract the annual intake of apprentices will also be a matter on which the secretary of states view will be relevant and so i do not believe that there is any cause for concern <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady seear puts her finger on a useful point but i was addressing my reply to the amendment on the marshalled list <e>", "<cs> yes i am certain that in reaching a view on the number of apprentices that are appropri <e>", "<cs> i do not disagree with my noble friend about the importance of this matter but i suggest to him that we need to maintain a degree of flexibility and to write these things in concrete in the statute is not necessarily the best way to achieve that <e> <s> the contract is a matter which will be discussed between the two parties from time to time <e> <s> it will run for a period of seven years as we have already discussed and will therefore be amenable to change in the light of the circumstances prevailing at the time it is renewed <e> <s> i hope that on reflection my noble friend will agree that to set this in statute would be a departure from the necessary flexibility we are aiming to achieve in these arrangements <e>", "<cs> i have not yet given that assurance in terms but i have said that i am attracted to the argument deployed by the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i need still to overcome one or two difficulties before we can proceed in that way but i hope to be able to do that and i shall certainly want to do so in consultation with the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> the bill says nothing about them because they are in no way affected by it <e>", "<cs> the royal corps of naval constructors are civil servants and they are not affected by the bill <e>", "<cs> they are affected <e>", "<cs> if the committee is content i should prefer the amendment to be agreed to as is proposed <e> <s> i recognise that it may need changing but at least i shall have something in the bill which gets us a little way down the road <e>", "<cs> to be truthful i am not fully briefed to counter the amendment of the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i am therefore inclined to suggest that the committee having accepted my amendment it ought to accept that of the noble and learned lord but with the same proviso as he attached to mine namely that we may need to change it <e>", "<cs> i have not for a moment indicated satisfaction with the amendment moved by the noble and learned lord but in the interests of harmony and in sweetness and light i thought that the best thing to do at this stage was to agree with what the noble and learned lord proposed with the proviso that we may well have to look at it again when we get to the next stage in the light of whatever other arrangements we may then propose <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i can only reiterate what the noble and learned lord has said <e> <s> this <e>", "<cs> with the committees permission i shall speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> these amendments seek to provide that any order made under clause of the bill should be subject to an affirmative resolution of both houses of parliament <e> <s> it may be helpful to the committee if i set out what we intend that such an order will contain and why therefore i believe that these two amendments are unnecessary <e>", "<cs> i am certainly not aware of any circumstances in which it would be thought appropriate to construct ships in the dockyards <e> <s> after all we have a considerable range of naval shipbuilding enterprises which are more than able and willing to fulfil our requirements in this area <e> <s> therefore without taking further advice i think the answer is that we have no intention that such a thing should happen <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend will not mind being interrupted but i said just now that i was replying to both amendments and i had understood it to have been agreed that both amendments nos <e> <s> and would be taken together <e>", "<cs> the principal aim of this bill is to introduce commercial practice into the royal dockyards <e> <s> while your lordships may have different ideas on how such changes should be made the common thread which has run through the debates here in another place and during the consultation phase has been that the dockyards must adopt a more commercial approach <e> <s> under our proposals the management of the dockyards would be procured from the private sector under contract with my right honourable friend and it would be appropriate in these circumstances for the accounting and auditing arrangements to follow as far as possible those for any other item or service purchased by the ministry of defence <e>", "<cs> these three clauses are somewhat lengthy and detailed <e> <s> i am not sure whether their wording owes its existence to some other bill or whether it has been tailor-made for this particular one <e> <s> whatever it may be i believe they are largely unnecessary <e> <s> whatever type of company is set up by my right honourable friend the secretary of state it would be under the authority of clause of this bill and as the committee will see the word company in this context is defined in clause as <e>", "<cs> if we are speaking about the contractor it depends on which contractor is sucessful in the competition and is awarded the contract <e> <s> i would expect it to be a plc a public limited company but i could not rule out the possibility that it might not be <e>", "<cs> my lords yes that is a desirable objective from a number of standpoints but we shall need to be certain that the important criteria are met <e> <s> i have in mind for example that the cost of the vessel is comparable with what a national project would produce <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment and the others relating to discharge all appear to be based as the noble lord has said on a paper submitted to the select committee of another place by an organisation called at ease <e> <s> that paper and the ministry of defences very full response to it are included in the select committees published special report <e> <s> our view of the proposals reflected in the noble lords amendments has not changed in any way since my departments memorandum was given to the select committee and i do not propose to go into all its detail here today noble lords will no doubt have seen it <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i dare say the arguments i am deploying this evening have some similarity to the arguments deployed on a previous occasion but they have lost nothing in the intervening years <e>", "<cs> my lords if i have your lordships permission to speak again i am not certain whether any work has been done specifically along the lines suggested <e> <s> in any event it is rather difficult to assess in isolation the effect of such a change without actually trying it <e> <s> i shall make some inquiries and if there is any further information available i shall be glad to write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may prevail upon your lordships for permission to speak again i understand there were no soldiers under the age of fighting in the falklands <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not what i said <e> <s> i said there were no soldiers <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to your lordships for rising yet again <e> <s> the royal marines of course count themselves as part of the royal navy and i should have thought the noble lord would know that <e>", "<cs> my lords on the last occasion that your lordships met to discuss the bill we considered an amendment not dissimilar to the one before us today <e> <s> at that time i stressed that all forms of discrimination by members of the armed forces whether on racial religious sex or other grounds would not be tolerated regardless of whether the victims of such discrimination were members of the public or other servicemen <e> <s> i explained the various statutory safeguards in the race relations act the service discipline acts and the code of practice on the treatment and questioning of persons by the service police which apply to the armed forces both in their internal discipline and to their recruitment practices <e> <s> i am fully satisfied that these provisions are more than adequate to make it quite clear that racial or other discrimination within the armed forces will not be tolerated and will be most firmly dealt with if any instances of such behaviour were to be discovered <e> <s> i do not believe that the noble lords amendment would contribute anything useful to our efforts to prevent discrimination but i agree with him that such discrimination is to be utterly condemned <e>", "<cs> my lords it is our intention once the island is safe to offer the island back to the original owner from whom it was purchased in <e> <s> what he would say about the prospect of continuous pop concerts i am not sure <e>", "<cs> my lords either that or swim <e>", "<cs> yes my lords my noble friend is quite right to point to the importance of that particular part of the tourism industry <e> <s> as i said in my main answer different people work out their figures in a different way and i am sure that is the reason why they reach different answers <e>", "<cs> my lords despite the fact that no change has recently been made in those arrangements nonetheless over a recent period jobs were additionally found in public houses and bars <e>", "<cs> my lords i bow to the noble and learned lords greater experience <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i need your lordships permission to speak again because i have already spoken once <e> <s> if the noble lord lord mishcon wants to speak in due course i am afraid he will have to do so without the benefit of any reply i may be able to give because to speak three times would be unduly trespassing on your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords briefly to reply to the noble lord i am afraid i do not know the answers to most of the questions he put <e> <s> indeed i do not know the answers to any of them without taking advice <e> <s> but for the majority of the questions answers do not exist because we do not monitor the ethnic make-up of the armed forces at the present time <e> <s> i do not know how many coloured admirals generals or air-marshals there are <e> <s> i have never counted them <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lords lord graham and lord mayhew indicated we discussed this matter at an earlier stage and i can do little more than repeat what i said on that occasion <e> <s> the main point that i wish to stress is that clause goes no further than the equivalent provisions of the criminal justice act and it follows our general policy of bringing service law into line with the civilian criminal practice wherever possible <e> <s> i could repeat at length the arguments that i offered at an earlier stage <e> <s> i believe at this moment that would not be welcome to your lordships but i hope that in the light of the very full debate that we had earlier the noble lord will not wish to press the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> i have listened very carefully to the arguments put forward in respect of these amendments but i must tell the committee that i have not heard anything to persuade me that the government are not following the correct course <e> <s> let me begin by pointing out a side effect of the amendments as drafted <e> <s> they would provide for the full amount of a persons rates to be covered by housing benefits but only if the person were on income support <e> <s> for people above income support levels or for people in full-time work the maximum amount of rates built into the housing benefit assessment could still be less than per cent <e> <s> if the secretary of state wished <e> <s> this is just the sort of imbalance which our reforms are designed to correct and indeed no one has seriously argued with this aspect of them <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord was listening to the remarks of my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> it is the case that many people who find themselves in this position are dependent upon benefits from their local authorities and it is indeed the case sadly that some local authorities have not been as responsible as we would have wished in setting their levels of expenditure and often for the unnecessary benefit of some people as some would say <e> <s> i think my noble friend was right and i believe the government are right to say that the proper thing is to give people a sense of responsibility in this area and i rest my case on that <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is of course quite correct in mentioning that <e> <s> that is another point which i am sure the noble lord lord banks will take into account <e>", "<cs> yes she has <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord will know the government have not been without sympathy for some of the objectives to which he has referred <e> <s> this is not the first occasion that the noble lord and those with whom he sits have raised propositions of this kind <e> <s> indeed i have had the privilege of answering one or two of them in the rather distant past <e> <s> during the course of his remarks the noble lord lord banks recited some of the arguments which the government have deployed from time to time in answer to the points contained in his proposals <e> <s> i think the noble lord forgive me at this time of night if i do not recite them all again <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to my noble friend and i should like to underline the governments commitment to war pensioners a group whom the whole committee will agree deserves special priority <e> <s> the governments intention so far as <e>", "<cs> like my noble friend i shall cut short the remarks that i might otherwise have made in reply to her amendment <e> <s> perhaps i may just say to my noble friend that i understand that discussions are now under way with the local authority associations about this matter <e> <s> i hope that a sensible way forward will be found and on that basis i hope that my noble friend will feel able to withdraw her amendment <e>", "<cs> we have said all along that we intended to examine closely housing benefit adjudication <e> <s> my right honourable friend the minister of state agreed in another place that there were strong arguments for bringing housing benefit within the purview of social security appeal tribunals and undertook to consider that further <e> <s> i reaffirm that we are actively pursuing the issue <e> <s> with that assurance i hope that the noble lord lord banks will feel able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say that i think the amendment proposed by the noble lord is somewhat perverse <e>", "<cs> i hope my noble friend will feel able to agree that we should proceed in the way proposed by the noble lord lord rochester <e> <s> as my noble friend will appreciate considerable discussions go on through the usual channels as to how we should handle these matters and if they fall apart as soon as we get to the floor of the chamber very often we find ourselves considerably detained <e> <s> so i hope my noble friend at least on this occasion will feel able to agree that we should discuss the amendment of the noble lord lord rochester with the one proposed by the noble lord lord wedderburn <e>", "<cs> it may help if i briefly explain the philosophy of the controls on deductions from wages in part i of the bill <e> <s> the government conducted a consultation exercise in on controls on deductions from wages that should be established if the truck acts were to be repealed <e> <s> the results suggested that there is no major problem that workers are currently experiencing in the field of deductions from wages other than in the limited area of deductions concerning cash shortages and stock deficiencies <e> <s> the bill provides for general controls on deductions from wages that broadly allow the parties to agree their own terms but then ensures the employer sticks to the terms <e> <s> it provides for special controls in clauses and on deductions to cover shortages <e>", "<cs> with regret i think that the practical effect of the amendments however well-intentioned would be to increase the number of dismissals leave employers in an impossibly uncertain position and reduce the number of jobs on offer <e> <s> i noticed considerable derision when i made that observation a moment ago <e> <s> i wonder how many noble lords opposite have been in the position as i have of being a small employer and being genuinely concerned about the bureaucracy that is attached to taking on new employees <e> <s> it is a deterrent <e> <s> noble lords opposite should not lose sight of that <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord decides what to do with his amendment he has i believe slightly misunderstood what i said during my remarks <e> <s> i was not in the least intending to be unreceptive to the proposal that he made <e> <s> i said that the department of employment would be issuing guidance before part i of the bill became law <e> <s> i pointed to at least two bodies that might wish to prepare a code of practice that would further assist employers and employees operating the provisions of this measure <e> <s> i am not sure how much further the noble lord wants me to go <e> <s> if it helps him i would be happy to agree to look again at the possibility of my noble friend preparing a code of practice of his own which i believe would go some way to meeting the noble lords concern <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has explained the amendments restructure clause which provides that the basic protection for workers that deductions from wages or payments by a worker to his employer are unlawful unless provided for in a statutory provision for example income tax in the contract or by the written consent of the worker <e>", "<cs> both these amendments seek to change the provision in clause that a deduction is authorised if the worker <e>", "<cs> i understand the point that the noble lord is trying to make <e> <s> i think it will generally be a matter of fact whether or not the employee actually wrote out the document concerned if he did not sign it <e> <s> it would be presumed generally in such circumstances and i guess that they will be pretty unusual ones that he had written it out in the presence of his employer who therefore knew that it was his document and that he was thereby assenting to the actions to which this provision applied <e> <s> i understand the anxiety in the noble lords mind on this matter <e> <s> if the noble lord will allow me perhaps i may look into this a little further particularly in the context of a document which the employee has written <e>", "<cs> the effect of this amendment no <e> <s> will be to add a further restriction on contractual or agreed deductions or payments <e> <s> it would ban deductions that are not made by reason of dishonesty default or other misconduct on the part of the worker <e> <s> this would ban a great many perfectly reasonable deductions for example to recover loans or to pay subscriptions to a companys social club <e>", "<cs> under the bill as it stands a worker can be made to compensate the employer for a loss or shortage only if the worker has a contractual responsibility for the loss or shortage for example his contract makes clear that he can be asked to compensate the employer for that loss or shortage <e> <s> this is clear law and it is reasonable that the parties should agree their own rules in the contract and stick to them <e> <s> it is quite reasonable that where a worker has accepted a contractual responsibility for losses or for the cash that is the lifeline of the business he should meet such losses or shortages <e>", "<cs> having listened to the noble and learned lord i am not sure there is any more i need say but perhaps i should explain that under the bill as drafted the employer will have to give the worker a copy or a written explanation of any terms authorising a deduction from wages prior to the making of a deduction authorised by them <e> <s> the important objective is to ensure that the worker knows of the terms before any deduction is made on account of them <e>", "<cs> clause prevents employers from varying the contract or obtaining the consent of the worker to the making of a deduction in respect of a particular event and then deducting in respect of an earlier event <e> <s> for example it would be unlawful for an employer to vary the contract or obtain consent to his making deductions for lateness and then to institute deductions for incidents of lateness that had occurred some months previously <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord seeks permission to withdraw the amendment he has asked me specifically whether we will look at the matter again <e> <s> i am bound to say that i cannot see much scope for that <e> <s> however i wish to be as constructive as can be <e> <s> i think that he is asking us to look at the possibility of distinguishing among different kinds of debt where some would be deducted retrospectively and others would not <e> <s> i believe that that presents considerable difficulties of definition <e> <s> nonetheless i shall ask for the matter to be looked at but to be frank not with much expectation of success <e>", "<cs> i understand that it is common for workers to agree that the employer can deduct sums and pay them to third parties for example to a trade union a charity or a social club with the third party telling the employer how much to deduct for example what subscription is due <e> <s> the most common example is the check-off of trade union subscriptions the worker signing an agreement that the employer pays directly to the union subscriptions of an amount notified by the union <e> <s> such arrangements are perfectly proper but it would be wrong i think if the employer was guilty of an unlawful deduction if the union got its calculations wrong <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just swiftly explain the objective of clause <e>", "<cs> i am not sure whether the noble lord lord rochester wishes to speak <e>", "<cs> members of the committee will not be surprised to hear that i very much hope this clause will remain part of the bill <e> <s> the clause of course provides a new and uniform protection for all workers manual and non-manual against arbitrary deductions from their wages <e> <s> deductions from wages will be lawful where they are provided for in the contract of employment where the worker agrees to them in writing or where they are authorised by statute <e> <s> this leaves it to the parties themselves to decide the circumstances in which deductions should be allowed enabling the parties themselves to sort out provisions <e>", "<cs> these amendments would ban deductions relating to shortages except where these <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has explained these amendments would have the effect of extending the protection provided by clauses and to all workers and not only to those involved in retail employment <e> <s> let me clarify what we are trying to do with clauses and <e> <s> clause provides certain basic protections against arbitrary deductions <e> <s> all deductions must be authorised by statute agreed in the contract of employment or be with the prior written consent of the worker concerned and the worker must have knowledge of any contractual term authorising a deduction before a deduction based on such a term is made <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord stoddart was so objectionable if he will forgive me for saying so i was thinking of offering some comfort to the noble lord on this amendment <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that my family comes from south wales as well and i am quite aware of the matters to which he refers <e> <s> i do not think it lies very well in the mouth of the noble lord to accuse me of sneering as he said i was <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that the sort of sentiments we hear from noble lords opposite from time to time seem to me to represent attitudes about a century out of date but be that as it may <e>", "<cs> subsections and to which the amendment is addressed deal with the situation where all or a part of the wages of a worker depend on the absence or extent of any cash shortage or stock deficiency <e> <s> the aim of the subsections is to remove a possible loophole by saying that if an employer pays a bonus related to the absence or size of a cash shortage or stock deficiency any failure to pay the bonus is to be treated as a deduction from wages related to cash shortages or stock deficiencies and is covered by the protection of clause which in effect means that the unpaid bonus must not exceed per cent <e> <s> of gross wages that is basic wages plus bonus <e>", "<cs> clause establishes controls on the amount of the instalments the employer may require the worker to pay him where the worker is liable under a contract or consent to pay for cash shortages or stock deficiencies <e> <s> these are strong controls which require each demand to be made on a pay day <e> <s> they limit the employer to demanding per cent <e> <s> of the wages payable on that day and require the employer to notify the worker in writing of his total liability and of each demand for payment <e>", "<cs> there is less i believe between the noble lord and myself than he suggests <e> <s> i wonder whether he has studied clause <e>", "<cs> i am always willing to undertake further consideration if i think it likely to be fruitful <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if i did not make myself clear <e> <s> yes the employer may indeed know the liability <e> <s> what he will not know is the amount of pay that will be due to the worker because he will not know how much overtime he has worked or how much bonus he is entitled to <e>", "<cs> as i said earlier i am always willing to have a look at the propositions which the noble lord puts to me if i think that there is some likelihood that we can reach an accommodation with him <e> <s> however i am bound to say because of the difficulties which i have already recited that i do not see much prospect of that <e> <s> however if it will give the noble lord some comfort i shall certainly agree to look at the matter further between now and the next stage <e>", "<cs> the aim of this provision is not only to ensure that workers are not left with little or no take-home pay due to deductions to cover cash shortages or stock deficiencies but also to ensure that employers can obtain sums to which they are contractually entitled <e> <s> by removing the per cent <e> <s> limit on deductions from the last instalment of wages this clause enables the employer to recover all that is still owing to him by a worker on the termination of a workers employment <e>", "<cs> i know that the noble lord is a considerable expert in these matters but i do not think that he is quite correct in that <e> <s> i think that the question of the debt is a matter of fact <e> <s> what we are discussing is the basis upon which the debt can be recovered <e> <s> i suspect i stand open to correction on this that it is always open to an employer to recover his debt in the usual way without deductions from wages if he thinks fit but of course that is not what we are discussing <e>", "<cs> the noble lord will not be surprised if i say that i regret we cannot go along with what he proposes in this amendment <e> <s> the aim of the provisions is not only to ensure that workers are not left with little or no take-home pay due to deductions but also to ensure that employers can obtain sums to which they are contractually entitled <e> <s> by removing the per cent <e> <s> limit on deductions from the last instalment of wages this clause enables the employer to recover all that is still owed to him by the worker on the termination of the workers employment <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord has made it clear that the intention of these amendments is to make unlawful all deductions or payments in respect of shortages or stock deficiencies unless they arise as a result of a workers dishonesty <e> <s> however they have the effect of removing all deductions or payments in these matters other than those arising from dishonesty from the protection of clauses and <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord explained this amendment prohibits deductions on account of cash shortages and stock deficiencies from sums which are not wages <e> <s> this bill is called the wages bill and gives protection against deductions from wages <e> <s> we have to define the meaning of wages not least because the employer has to know what are wages to establish the size of the per cent <e> <s> limit <e> <s> in defining wages we have been concerned to exclude sums that might artificially inflate the per cent <e> <s> figure such as a loan and sums that are not commonly thought of as wages such as a pension or payment of expenses <e>", "<cs> clause establishes procedures for workers to present complaints to industrial tribunals in respect of deductions from wages or receipt of payments that contravene the provisions of clauses to <e> <s> subsection sets out the four grounds on which a worker can present a complaint to an industrial tribunal <e> <s> the amendments seek to change subsection <e>", "<cs> under the bill where a worker successfully complains to a tribunal about an unlawful deduction or payment the tribunal will order the employer to repay the sum of money in dispute to the worker <e> <s> the amendment would give tribunals discretion to make an assessment of loss detriment or infringement of rights suffered by the worker and to make an award of compensation <e> <s> however i believe that the most important outcome of tribunal proceedings must surely be to ensure that the worker gets the actual sum of money due to him <e> <s> this is achieved by the provisions in their present form <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend will allow me to say so that is very much a different question <e> <s> but one of the features of this bill is that very considerable constraints are imposed on the employer on the amount of deduction and the purpose of the deduction that he can make <e> <s> this has been a matter which the noble lord lord wedderburn and the noble lord lord mccarthy and others and i have been discussing the whole afternoon if i may say so so that i believe that my noble friend can sleep easy <e>", "<cs> i am pretty sure that this bill does not have the defect which the noble lord suggests <e> <s> however i recognise that there may be more than one respectable view about that <e> <s> thus if the noble lord is willing to withdraw his amendment i shall undertake to see that this matter is carefully examined between now and the next stage and we shall come forward with an amendment if that is thought appropriate <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will give me a chance i shall tell him <e>", "<cs> the effect of this new clause would be that workers irrespective of age length of service or hours or work would have new rights to complain to an industrial tribunal either on the gounds that they had been dismissed or that action short of dismissal had been taken against them for bringing complaints under the provisions of part i of the bill <e>", "<cs> i should have to take advice on that question <e> <s> i cannot answer the noble lord without doing so but i certainly undertake to do that <e>", "<cs> i replied to the amendment which appears on the marshalled list <e> <s> if the noble lord having heard the shortcomings of that amendment wishes to table another one at a later stage i shall consider that too <e>", "<cs> the intention of the bill in defining a worker covered by part i is to ensure that the bill protects everyone who enters into a contract to do work himself other than someone genuinely operating a business or offering a professional service on his own account <e> <s> anyone who is employed by someone else should be protected <e> <s> but if the person doing the work is doing it as part of a business that he is running he should not be covered by the protections in the bill <e> <s> then the law relating to commercial contracts should operate <e>", "<cs> i was just coming to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> merely adds the words added by the second definition to the first definition <e> <s> we believe that that is unnecessary <e> <s> a person who undertakes to do or perform personally any work or services for another person who is not a professional client of his will be encompassed within the existing definition <e> <s> i hope that i have reassured the noble lord <e>", "<cs> may i try to help the noble lord further <e> <s> a labour-only subcontractor is covered by part i a person who is genuinely self-employed and operating his own business is not a worker under the bill <e> <s> a plumber who does a job for the noble lord as part of a business that he operates is not covered by part i if the noble lord employs him to do the job personally not as any part of a business he is operating then he is covered <e>", "<cs> it is never far from my mind <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly explain what the definition of a deduction from wages in subsections and of clause achieves <e> <s> the overall objective of part i of the bill is to provide protections against deductions from wages with a remedy before an industrial tribunal <e> <s> the definition of deductions makes clear that a failure to pay the worker the amount of wages properly payable to him is a deduction from his wages unless this arises from an error of computation by the employer as to the gross amount of wages properly payable <e>", "<cs> this amendment brings us to what we have to recognise is a fundamental difference between the government and noble lords opposite <e> <s> in the reign of william iv in parliament passed the first truck act to give artificers who today we broadly regard as manual workers the right to insist on being paid in coin of the realm <e> <s> the abuse that was thus outlawed was the device of paying labourers in truck that is in tokens exchangeable only at the company shop <e>", "<cs> we carefully considered this proposal which was of course as the noble lord lord rochester has already said debated in another place <e> <s> the governments view is that the time has come to make the method of wage payment entirely a contractual matter and we are consequently very reluctant to reimport new and unnecessary statutory controls <e>", "<cs> my lords as we made clear at the time we profoundly regretted the incident to which the noble lord has referred <e> <s> as he says it was within miles of the falkland islands which i suppose gives us some cause for thought <e>", "<cs> my lords we expect to receive the results of the fao study by the late summer <e> <s> data on fish stocks have been made available by major fishing nations including argentina and ourselves <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not the least of argentinian misconceptions <e>", "<cs> my lords the united nations has had to reduce expenditure in a number of areas because of delayed and withheld budget contributions from several member states <e> <s> we pay promptly and in full and expect others to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose the only advice that i could offer to the united nations and i fear that it would be presumptuous of me to do so would be to suggest that it ensures that it spends its money in the most cost-effective way it can and cuts out waste and duplication and indeed some of the things it does that we regard as wasteful and unsuitable <e>", "<cs> my lords the regular budget for was million dollars but at the st december million dollars was owed by some countries <e> <s> among the chief offenders were the ussr and argentina <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> our proposals for the reform of the wages councils system are based on the responses that we received on the consultation exercise that we conducted last year <e> <s> they showed that the majority of employers and employers organisations favoured retention and reform of the system <e> <s> i acknowledge that most employers in the clothing industry favoured retention with minimal change but it remains the case that employers overall wanted reform and that is what we have provided <e>", "<cs> a central purpose of this part of the bill is to promote employment particularly employment for young people <e> <s> the government are convinced of the link between pay and jobs <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend lord vinson for his intervention <e> <s> no one could have explained the position more graphically <e>", "<cs> i made it clear during second reading and on our last committee day that a lot of research had been done <e> <s> i have recited it and i dare say that the noble lord recalls that <e>", "<cs> there was a gallup poll for example last summer which showed clear evidence that young people preferred low paid jobs to no jobs at all <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the noble baroness has fully taken the point on board <e> <s> the problem is that younger people are less experienced and less skilful <e> <s> it is inevitable that they are not able to earn so much <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i can add to what i have already said <e> <s> as i mentioned just now if young people were as fast as adults then they would be <e>", "<cs> i very much share the view of my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter that the remarks of the noble baroness in response to the description of the particular situation offered by my noble friend lord vinson were quite extraordinary and i feel certain that on reflection the noble baroness will regret that she made them <e>", "<cs> noble lords and noble baronesses opposite have if i may say so a remarkable capacity for ignoring the obvious and flying in the face of sensible pragmatic propositions <e> <s> the sensible pragmatic proposition which i bring before your lordships in this clause is that by ensuring that young people do not price themselves out of the market they will make the best of the employment opportunities that there are available to them <e> <s> i ask your lordships to hearken to the example proffered by my noble friend lord vinson a few moments ago which graphically demonstrated if the committee will allow me to say so the proposition enshrined in this section of the bill <e>", "<cs> because we are bringing forward this legislation <e>", "<cs> as the government have repeatedly made plain and indeed i said this on <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry that the noble lord lord rochester takes that view <e> <s> one would think that i was proposing some cataclysmic change to the arrangements <e> <s> what i am actually proposing is that the independent members be increased from three to <e>", "<cs> current wage orders are lengthy and complex and despite what the noble lord has said they tend to deal with all pay and related conditions of employment <e> <s> employers and workers can have great difficulty in interpreting them <e> <s> responses to the consultative papers show almost universal support for simplifying wages orders <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to the arguments which have been adduced in support of these amendments which would as has been explained have the effect of maintaining the power of wages councils to set special higher minimum rates for work done on sundays <e> <s> however i am afraid that i have heard nothing to persuade me that a departure from the course on which we are set would be justified <e>", "<cs> i had hoped that by now i would have been able to assure the committee that we were not seeking to abandon piece workers to their fate <e> <s> i think that the noble baroness would have us introduce a universal fallback rate for piece workers in terms of a minimum earnings limit <e> <s> were we to do so we should be extending protection beyond the basic protection which this bill seeks to provide <e> <s> i do not believe that we should depart from this fundamental principle <e> <s> the consequences could be serious in terms of opportunities for employment <e>", "<cs> i hope that i did not inadvertently mislead the committee <e> <s> i am seeking to put a new provision into the bill to replace an old one <e> <s> having persuaded the committee if i can to agree to the new provision i shall not want to insist on the old one staying in the bill <e>", "<cs> i am very willing <e> <s> perhaps i may do that by writing to the noble lord and giving him <e>", "<cs> i should be happy to place a copy of that letter in the library <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord will forgive me if i resist the temptation to fight the social battles of the last century when discussing the amendment <e> <s> if this amendment were accepted it would enable wages councils to continue setting the complex rules about holidays and payment for holidays which bedevil the present wages orders <e>", "<cs> the noble lord on more than one occasion during the passage of the bill having heard some of the shortcomings of his amendment has then sought to seek my views on some other amendment not that on the marshalled list <e> <s> the amendment to which the noble lord invites our agreement retains the whole mish-mash of arrangements regarding payment and minimum period for holidays <e> <s> as i said earlier this has been one of the main difficulties encountered on wages council orders <e> <s> the detail has been such that even large firms have had difficulties sometimes in understanding the orders and a number of errors have inadvertently occurred <e> <s> it is this inordinate detail that we do not think should stand between an employer and employee and that we seek to sweep away by this measure <e> <s> this amendment would prevent us doing so <e> <s> i invite the committee to reject it <e>", "<cs> i am again answering the amendment on the marshalled list <e> <s> the amendment does not have one part it has two <e> <s> the second part in particular i find most objectionable <e>", "<cs> i am not likely to get much support from my own side just at the moment nonetheless i make no apology for restating once again the thought which underlies part ii of this bill the radical reform and simplification of the wages council system <e> <s> the government are responding to the almost unanimously held view of employers who commented on the consultative paper <e> <s> there could be no mistaking their message <e> <s> the system was in urgent need of fundamental overhaul and if this could not be achieved then it should be abolished <e> <s> it is clear from this and other similar amendments which we have been discussing that noble lords opposite are not concerned with whether employers are encumbered by unnecessary burdens <e> <s> they would have them spend valuable time digesting unduly complicated regulations which inhibit them from getting

advised that the words are not entirely perfect but if the noble baroness will withdraw this amendment i will undertake to bring one back at the next stage which achieves what she desires <e>", "<cs>

we will be proceeding with the discussions and the negotiations in accordance with the timetable that i have already indicated to my noble friend and to which i referred at an earlier stage <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the governments intention that the tupe regulations as they are called should apply to this transfer <e> <s> while i know that many noble lords are conversant with the provisions of these regulations let me emphasise in particular that they provide for the transfer of both the recognition of independent trade unions by the new <e>", "<cs> well my lords we go to very considerable lengths to secure the interests of the workforce in these circumstances <e> <s> perhaps the first and foremost protection is what are called the tupe regulations themselves <e> <s> i

civil service pension scheme to which most if not all of the present dockyard employees belong <e> <s> what we cannot do is ensure that these identical arrangements are perpetuated for ever and a day <e> <s> that would negate many of the arguments in favour of the privatisation process as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have taken considerable care in addressing the question of <e>",

that time we shall be amortising the setting up costs which we estimate at million <e> <s> i think my arithmetic is right when i say that million amortised over years is million a year and if you deduct million from million you get million <e>", "<cs> my lords if i have your lordships permission to speak again may i say that i dare say we are not comparing like with like <e> <s> i have not seen the noble lords figures but naturally i shall look at anything he cares to give me <e> <s> i assume the figures he gives include large sums of money which would have been spent anyway <e>", "<cs>

which the noble lord suggests <e> <s> i said that we were considering the matter and that remains the position <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the tenor of my earlier answers indicated agreement with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i really do not think i can add to what i have said already <e> <s> i do not believe that there is any purpose in dragooning people from one section or another of the community into the armed forces or in dragooning them out <e> <s> we want people who want to go into the armed forces and who are best suited to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords it is indeed the case that many people from the ethnic minorities for example the gurkhas have made a signal contribution to our armed forces <e>", "<cs> my lords as i explained on an earlier occasion we are considering this matter further <e> <s> i am not in a position to make any announcement today but an announcement will be made in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that the noble lord is simply mimicking the words of one of his honourable friends in another place <e> <s> those were almost the precise words used by one of his honourable friends yesterday or perhaps the day before <e> <s> as i have reminded your lordships on many occasions the armed forces are an equal opportunities employer <e> <s> entry to the armed forces is open to everyone and promotion is on merit <e>", "<cs> my lords about as many welshmen as there are in the welsh guards <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret to say i did not count them <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend will allow me i shall reflect upon the implications of that question <e>", "<cs> my lords i said on an earlier occasion that we were considering the possibility of introducing some form of ethnic monitoring in the armed forces and that an announcement would be made in due course <e> <s> but let me say again that i have no reason to doubt that the position is not exactly as have described it <e>", "<cs> my lords i can perhaps do no better than quote the words which i used on th july <e> <s> i entirely accept the noble lords correction to the remarks he made when we were considering this matter the other day <e> <s> on th july i said <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps again i can do no better than to quote my right honourable friend the secretary of state for defence who said in another place on th june that although <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that i can add to what i said in the original answer when i said that we were considering how best to achieve privatisation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indeed aware that i have given no clear indication <e> <s> the reason for that is that the government have not yet decided the way forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i am firmly convinced that the best interests of the employees lie in the moving of their company into the private sector whether it be in one entity or more than one <e> <s> that is what we are seeking to achieve <e>", "<cs> my lords clearly the position would be slightly changed <e> <s> that problem was of course addressed during the legislations passage through parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords legislation or no i hope not next session <e> <s> but as your lordships know we had a very full and interesting debate in committee on the principle of whether there would be merit in the secretary of state issuing a code of practice on what might be reasonable deductions from wages <e> <s> forceful arguments were put on both sides <e> <s> at the conclusion of the debate we voted on the matter and by a clear majority i think it was we voted against the view that there was merit in the idea of a code <e> <s> normally one would expect that that would be the end of the matter <e> <s> i think there is room for more than one view as to whether your lordships should be asked to consider the matter again <e>", "<cs> my lords as your lordships know clause of the bill limits employers to making deductions of no more than per cent <e> <s> of gross wages where deductions are made on account of cash shortages or stock deficiencies <e> <s> there is a similar control on payments made by workers to employers on account of such shortages <e> <s> in the governments view this strikes the right balance between the rights of employers to recover sums contractually due to them and the need to ensure that workers do not lose large parts of any one pay packet to meet shortages <e>", "<cs> my lords the aim of the provisions in this clause is to ensure that an employer is able on the termination of a workers employment to recover outstanding amounts owed to him by that worker on account of cash shortages or stock deficiencies <e> <s> this is achieved by removing the per cent <e> <s> limit on deductions from the final instalment of wages to the worker <e> <s> this is fair to the employer as well as the worker <e> <s> after all the effect of the per cent <e> <s> limit is to delay the time at which the employer would otherwise be entitled to make deductions <e>", "<cs> my lords before i am tempted to withdraw the amendment perhaps i may remind your lordships that this was one of the lollipops which we offered at an earlier stage <e>", "<cs> my lords let me start by saying if i may that the remarks i made at committee stage did not remotely imply any support for the concept that dismissal for complaint under the bills provisions should be automatically unfair <e> <s> i merely declined to deal with an amendment that was not before the committee during that stage in our considerations <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say at the outset that the purpose of this provision is to help the worker and not to hinder <e> <s> that is what i believe to be the effect of the amendments that i have proposed <e> <s> however if the noble lord lord wedderburn thinks otherwise that is something that i should very much like to consider because he and i are clearly at one in that point of view <e> <s> if your lordships will therefore be good enough to agree these amendments i shall certainly undertake to respond to lord wedderburns request to reply to him in detail on the way that we see these provisions working <e> <s> having done that i shall he happy to copy my letter to other noble lords and in particular the noble lord lord rochester who have taken an interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin by saying that the unfair contract terms act is an enactment dealing almost exclusively with rights under consumer contracts and that in the governments view it was never intended that it should influence employment law <e> <s> there is one minor exception to that in paragraph of schedule to the act which makes it clear that parts of section which prevent the exclusion of liability for negligence apply to contracts of employment to the extent that they favour the employee <e> <s> the act contains a similar exception in its application to scotland though it is achieved in a rather different way <e> <s> this bill in no way affects those minor exceptions <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend may be referring to the propositions contained in the next amendment <e> <s> i am not yet certain whether the noble and learned lord intends to move that amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if i have your lordships permission to speak again as i think i made clear during my earlier remarks the effect of the regulations is very clearly embodied into the legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord is aware that my noble friend lady vickers asked me whether she could bring a delegation of trade unionists to see me <e> <s> i readily agreed to that <e> <s> the trade unions then said that they would not come <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the observations that your lordships have made on this matter <e> <s> in reply to the number of points made by noble friend lady vickers i hope she will not mind my saying that almost all the points she raised were covered at one point or another during the discussions we have had on this bill <e> <s> if i am wrong about that and there is something she has raised that i have overlooked i shall happily write to my noble friend <e> <s> i am afraid that with more firmness i must say the same <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know about being open-minded but i am certain that employers pay close attention to personal skills such as numeracy ability to work in groups and communications skills when recruiting graduates and that is often more important than the precise subject that has been studied <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i have the figure for which the noble lord asked <e> <s> however i can say that the percentage of graduates from united kingdom universities believed to be unemployed and of course the precise number is not always possible to arrive at was only per cent <e> <s> last year that is <e> <s> also the universities the polytechnics and other institutions taken together produced graduates last year <e> <s> i hope that that information will assist the noble lord <e> <s> the important point is to ensure that the teachers remain in good supply and the government are concerned to ensure that that is achieved <e> <s> your lordships will recall the question recently answered by my noble friend lord swinton who explained what we were doing in that regard <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly convey the noble earls views to my right honourable friend <e> <s> i agree that the sandwich course system is extremely valuable not least because it gives young people a taste not only for the academic disciplines that they are seeking to acquire but of the real world as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that just underlines the point made by the noble earl lord halsbury <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord kilmarnock proposed this same amendment during the consideration of the bill in committee and i am sorry that he and the noble lord lord banks whose name also appears on this amendment remain concerned about the use of regulation-making powers for the pensions provisions of the bill <e> <s> i know that the noble lords concerns are wider than the specific effect of this amendment <e> <s> but i should first explain again why we have given the secretary of state a power rather than a duty in paragraph of schedule to make regulations about who may establish personal pension schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords this is such an extremely difficult and incomprehensible amendment that the only thing to do is to accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords in the hope that i am speaking to the right amendment and the difficulties for me are no less than the ones that confront the noble lord lord pitt may i say that the preservation requirements which are set out in schedule to the social security act are constructed on the basis that they do not have direct effect it is the responsibility of scheme trustees or managers to make the rules conform with the requirements <e> <s> it would be anomalous to make changes in the preservation requirements which override scheme rules when the preservation requirements as a whole do not <e> <s> compliance with the preservation requirements can however be achieved through the powers of the occupational pensions board to modify those rules which conflict with the law but which schemes are unable or unwilling to change <e> <s> we still believe that the occupational pensions board modification procedures are the right way to proceed and i hope that i can persuade the noble lord lord banks to agree with me <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord banks referred just now to the debate in committee when he moved an amendment in very similar terms to what was then clause and is now clause <e> <s> however i fully accept that the amendments fit clause better than clause i have not overlooked the support that came from my side of the house on that occasion but i can go no further today than could my noble friend in committee <e> <s> she explained then that there is no bar in this bill or in any other social security legislation on members of occupational pension schemes making additional voluntary contributions to other sorts of pension scheme <e> <s> but i have to say that no purpose would be served by giving them a right in this bill to make such contributions <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a doctrine that has been deployed on a number of occasions in your <e>", "<cs> my lords as has been explained this amendment would extend to unemployed people who have been available for employment the special protection of serps rights which we have already <e>", "<cs> my lords if i need your lordships permission to speak again and if i have it let me say that we are dealing with a fairly narrowly based problem <e> <s> there are too many people in the circumstances that the noble baroness and the noble lord have described or indeed in any unemployment category <e> <s> nonetheless those currently unemployed for over five years account for less than per cent <e> <s> of the working population <e> <s> i should prefer the number to be substantially less <e> <s> but i do not think that the amendment proposes an appropriate solution <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pretty accustomed to rising at this box and saying how surprised i am that this amendment should be brought forward yet again <e> <s> i cannot say that on this occasion <e> <s> this amendment was not brought forward at an earlier stage and such surprise as i have is perhaps that it was not brought forward at an earlier stage given that it is a matter of such considerable interest at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lord is correct in his understanding <e> <s> it is true that this amendment has been refined and improved <e> <s> the per cent <e> <s> limit applies widely to ensure that the workers are all fully covered <e> <s> the canteen workers are covered as are the cashiers <e> <s> i hope that is the assurance which the noble lord is seeking and that he will therefore be able to give this amendment a fair wind <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments are similar to amendments which were tabled by noble lords opposite during committee and report stages but with one notable difference <e> <s> the bill limits deductions on account of cash shortages or stock deficiencies to per cent <e> <s> of wages but removes the limit from the final instalment of wages <e> <s> the amendments would remove the limit from the final instalment of wages only when an employer has established the existence of the cash shortage or stock deficiency in respect of which he has made a deduction or received a payment <e>", "<cs> my lords

that point <e> <s> i have complete sympathy with the point that he made <e> <s> perhaps i may take some advice on how we could give effect to that sympathy and write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to every noble lord for their kind words to me personally <e> <s> when we set out on the passage of this bill i never really thought that i would be able to persuade the noble lord lord wedderburn to agree with my views on the matter <e> <s> the only risk was that i would be persuaded to agree with his <e> <s> happily i have avoided that fate and happily most of your lordships did not agree with the noble lord either because the bill has passed through your lordships house unscathed and for that at least i am grateful <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may deal with as many of the points raised by both noble lords as i can and they have raised a good number <e> <s> the essence of the problem we were facing is that the ministry of defence really does not have business to sustain two tank factories <e> <s> i wish it were otherwise but that in fact is the case <e> <s> therefore there were powerful arguments for the rationalisation of british tank-making capacity not least to make it more competitive in international and collaborative markets <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether the noble lord is referring only to the leeds factory or to royal ordnance as a whole <e> <s> i believe that there are one or two points still to be resolved with royal ordnance as a whole but i have no reason to believe that agreement is not in sight <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord is going a little too far if he will forgive me for saying so <e> <s> clearly i cannot give the categoric assurance he seeks but as the statement makes clear it is our undoubted preference to dispose of royal ordnance save the tank factory at leeds as a single entity <e> <s> we are looking for bids to make that possible <e> <s> however i cannot give the categoric assurance of the kind he requests <e>", "<cs> my lords it is unhappily the case that royal ordnance leeds that is the tank-making part of the royal ordnance organisation has not been particularly successful in recent years in securing overseas orders <e> <s> the fact is that the vickers tank factory at newcastle has been rather more successful and also has some exciting prospects currently in hand <e> <s> the way is now clear for the leeds organisation to share in the success which has already occurred and indeed it bodes well for the future for the vickers organisation <e> <s> i believe that the workers there will appreciate that <e>", "<cs> my lords on the latter point that is a discussion which i have had with the noble lord on a number of occasions in parallel circumstances <e> <s> the fact is that there is a very effective machinery whereby defence contractors are required to maintain the security of their premises particularly in regard to classified information <e> <s> as regards vickers that will continue to be the case when it becomes the owner of the leeds enterprise <e> <s> the arrangements are well-known to vickers of course because it has been a defence contractor in one way or another for a great period of time <e> <s> i am quite certain that no difficulty will arise <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to agree that we would prefer to have two british sources from which we could buy our tanks but the fact is that we could not sustain two sources <e> <s> nor could two sources be sustained by success in foreign markets because as i have already said royal ordnance leeds did not have conspicuous success in foreign markets <e> <s> indeed the factory had not sold anything of significance abroad in recent years <e> <s> for that reason the desirable solution desirable as it is of having two sources of supply was clearly not practical <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend

the short title of the bill during its passage through your lordships house <e> <s> if the noble lord wants wider dissemination of the letter that i have written to my noble friend lady vickers or of this matter generally i should be happy to reply promptly to any further question say for written answer that he may like to table <e>", "<cs> my lords the point my noble friend makes will certainly be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords that will certainly be the case but we shall have to consider the tender to which the noble lord refers in the context of the others that we receive <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear i can do no more than to remind the noble lord of the answer i gave to earlier supplementary questions when i say that those points will be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly note the noble lords views which as he says he has already conveyed to me <e> <s> as for the time taken to find a successor to professor caldwell the fact of the matter is that after professor caldwell decided to resign there was no rush of volunteers to replace him <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> we anticipate that the new chairman will want to choose a team of his own <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i of course cannot give a positive assurance of that kind <e> <s> i would only observe that i understand that the speaker has ruled in the other place that the question of the litigation is now <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may be permitted to answer the last question put to me first yes i can readily endorse the position of the allies which is that we shall never be the first to use any weapon save in response to an attack <e> <s> that is an observation which i have made to your lordships before today and i am very happy to confirm it again <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that the elimination of whole categories of weapon is a desirable long-term objective but the government have made it clear that nuclear disarmament must go hand in hand with a reduction of conventional weapons and indeed an improvement of east-west relations generally which includes dialogue on human rights and such other matters <e>", "<cs> my lords as for the zero-zero option i can only repeat the answer that i gave just now to the noble lord lord chalfont <e> <s> elimination of whole categories of weapons is certainly a desirable long-term objective <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly think that the position is not as simple as some people imagine <e> <s> my noble friend speaking from his particular position of experience in these matters will i am sure confirm that <e> <s> i also confirm the point made by my noble friend that in recent years one of the most remarkable things we have had to observe is the increase in soviet conventional forces <e> <s> that is why the reduction in whole categories of weapons as i said just now while certainly a desirable objective is nonetheless a long term one and will certainly have to be considered in the context of reductions in conventional forces as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly think that it matters if they have more conventional weapons than we do but if the noble lord is concerned about the unanimity of nato defence ministers at gleneagles i can assure him that the communiqu and i invite the noble lord to study it particularly paragraph was issued unanimously and all the ministers at gleneagles subscribed to it <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right if i may say so to draw your lordships attention to that point <e> <s> it is indeed the case that in recent years along with an increase in the more conventional conventional weapons if i may call them that there has likewise been an increase in russias chemical weapons capability <e> <s> we seek a worldwide ban on those too <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i certainly hope that the geneva discussions will continue <e> <s> i believe they will and there is every evidence to support that proposition <e> <s> i agree that we need to get the other matters that we agreed about into perspective and into proportion <e> <s> the rejection of diplomats and so on which goes on from time to time is a trivial matter compared with the main issues that have been discussed between the two leaders <e> <s> it would greatly assist the process of the main negotiations if the soviet union would ensure that their diplomats stick to diplomacy <e>", "<cs> my lords it was said originally by soviet officials i believe in more than one forum and perhaps i can let the noble lord have a note about that <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that there is no difference at all in the position between myself and my noble friend lady young <e> <s> the position is that nato will never be the first to use any weapons save in response to an attack <e> <s> that is the position we have consistently adopted and the position i have repeated again today <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that the noble lord has pointed to another anomaly in the defence policies of the noble lords on those benches which yesterdays alleged agreement did nothing to resolve <e>", "<cs> the royal navy has taken part in exercises with a wide variety of united states warships including some equipped with the aegis fire control system <e> <s> it is not our practice to comment on the detailed operational capabilities of allied vessels <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce of donington opened his remarks by speaking about some sort of bonanza some sort of spend spend spend <e> <s> this is no bonanza <e> <s> as the statement makes clear the proportion of gdp which is being devoted to public expenditure as reflected in the statement is a declining not an increasing proportion <e> <s> if the noble lord wants to talk about spend spend spend i would remind him of the commitments which his party has apparently entered into which amount to some million <e> <s> that is if one excludes the undertakings given by mr meacher the status of whose assurances is never entirely clear <e>", "<cs> my lords the public expenditure increases which were referred to in the statement <e>", "<cs> it is not being refuelled by that at all my lords <e> <s> it is being fuelled by increased prosperity of our companies not least in the export field <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right to point to the fact that the statement referred to a considerable increase this year in local government expenditure and an undoubted increase next year along the lines that the statement reported <e> <s> certainly the government will not relax their efforts to ensure that local authority expenditure is contained within reasonable limits <e> <s> there is a limit to the controls that the government have over local authorities as my noble friend will be aware but we have moved into an era of rate-capping which can be applied where appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i should need to have notice in order to give a reply to the question which my noble friend has put to me <e> <s> i shall certainly make inquiries and see what information i can give him <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments policies will always be sufficiently flexible to take whatever changes occur fully into account <e> <s> if i may seek to reply to the first point that the noble lord raised about the special arrangement for the advanced petroleum revenue tax which was announced in the statement that proposal is designed precisely to deal with the matters to which the noble lord referred although i must say that i do not think that i would have referred to them in quite the apocalyptic terms used by the noble lord <e> <s> i understand that there is to be a detailed press release by the inland revenue this afternoon giving the details of those arrangements which i hope the noble lord will feel able to look at <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case if i have your lordships permission to intervene again may i ask the noble and gallant lord to make every effort to be in his place when i come to wind up this evening and i will tell him <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not in the least agreeing with the noble lord <e> <s> i was shaking my head in disbelief and disagreement with the facts that he was alleging to recite <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer has been recited on more than one occasion <e> <s> i shall recite it again later tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down he has asked us to reflect upon the civilian casualties which sadly did indeed take place as a result of the american raid on libya <e> <s> i wonder whether he would equally reflect upon the murder of woman police constable fletcher by a weapon shot from the libyan diplomatic mission in london <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the fourth successive year that i have had the privilege of rising to reply to this debate <e> <s> as always the quality of the contributions has been high as is only to be expected in your lordships house where so much experience resides on the subjects of foreign affairs and defence <e> <s> a number of telling points have been made and i shall try to deal with as many as possible in a few moments <e> <s> but before i do so i should like to make one or two general remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords the position upon our use of nuclear weapons is plain <e> <s> we have said that we shall never be the first to use nuclear weapons or any weapons save in response to an attack <e> <s> that is the scenario as the noble and gallant lord knows well <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case the noble baroness had better prepare a replacement for the system that is about to wear out <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that they have been widely canvassed in the press <e> <s> i shall perhaps write to the noble lord with the details <e> <s> both the noble lords lord cledwyn and lord gladwyn asked about the forthcoming visit of my right honourable friend the prime minister to washington <e> <s> the objective of the visit is to continue at the highest level our very close bilateral consultations with the united states administration including discussion on arms control <e>", "<cs> my lords we are ready to discuss a wide range of matters with argentina including the normalisation of relations between our two countries <e> <s> we have made our position on sovereignty absolutely clear time and again <e> <s> if the argentinians have any doubt about it that must be very surprising <e> <s> we did indeed start negotiations at one time as the noble lord will recall some years ago in switzerland and the argentinians torpedoed those negotiations almost at the first breath <e>", "<cs> my lords the blockage in the way of arms control at reykjavik was the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that the noble lords private notice question had he been allowed to ask it would have borne a striking resemblance to the supplementary that we have now heard <e> <s> be that as it may i do not wish to duck the question that the noble lord has put <e> <s> if he asks me for a short comment on the declaration made by argentina yesterday i would say that it smelt of old wine in new bottles <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right in what he says in the latter part of his supplementary <e> <s> i emphasise that the interim fisheries protection zone that we have declared around the falkland islands is indeed interim <e> <s> we would much prefer a multilateral solution to the problem <e> <s> if a multilateral solution is to emerge we shall hasten to reconsider our position <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is asking me to comment further upon the declaration made by president alfonsin yesterday i think i would say that it seems to me that there is no fundamental change in the argentinian position or even any detailed change in the argentinian position which is that it requires first and foremost to discuss the sovereignty of the falkland islands added to which it appears to have prejudged the outcome of such discussions <e> <s> that is not a position that the british government can accept <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is the position of the argentine government that talks may now proceed in a number of detailed matters then the united kingdom will be very willing to take part in such talks <e> <s> what we cannot agree to do is to discuss sovereignty with the argentinians <e> <s> that is a position we have repeatedly made clear on a number of occasions <e> <s> of course the position was different in february but then the argentinians in the midst of those negotiations chose to invade the falkland islands <e>", "<cs> my lords in the past the argentinians have made it clear that all aspects as they call it of the falkland islands problem include sovereignty and all aspects of the falkland islands problem are apparently what they now wish to negotiate <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot think that the argentinians are under any misapprehension about the british governments position <e> <s> it has been made clear to them time and time again <e> <s> indeed on one occasion two years ago we went to berne to open negotiations with the argentinians and a formula had been agreed which would have dealt with the sovereignty position with regard to those negotiations <e> <s> the argentinians torpedoed those negotiations in the first breath <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the soviet union have made it clear that they will respect the british position as far as the fisheries protection zone goes <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the declaration which was the subject of the supplementary question of the noble lord lord kennet was conveyed to the british government <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord opened his remarks by saying that i was digging my feet in on behalf of the british government <e> <s> not so my lords <e> <s> i am digging in if those are the right words on behalf of the people of the falkland islands <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a question which the noble lady may care to address to other members of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have always said that they would be prepared to consider the lifting of the protection zone in appropriate circumstances <e> <s> the principal circumstance is of course that the threat to the falkland islands has disappeared <e>", "<cs> my lords there have been no formal statements by the governments of members of the european community on the governments decision to declare a falkland islands conservation zone <e>", "<cs> my lords i am told that press reports are innacurate and exaggerated <e> <s> it is in the interests of spains important fishing industry to participate in an orderly and controlled fishery <e>", "<cs> my lords we have been in regular touch with the commission and our partners <e> <s> my right honourable and learned friend the foreign secretary sent a personal message to his european community colleagues and to the fisheries commissioner on th october <e> <s> i think that is probably the answer to the questions of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier there has been no formal response <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will be aware we do not normally discuss the informal communications about which i think the noble lord is asking <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> as i said earlier in answer to a supplementary question from the noble lord lord shackleton the government would very much prefer a multilateral solution to this problem <e> <s> indeed if such a multilateral solution would emerge we would hasten to reconsider our position about the particular arrangements that we have recently put in place <e> <s> we shall continue to co-operate with the fao as they think fit <e>", "<cs> my lords once the fishing season is over the pressure is off to make any arrangements of the kind to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> at the outset of the last fishing season we were still hopeful that the multilateral approach would have succeeded <e> <s> afterwards it became clear that it would not <e> <s> therefore we have now put our unilateral regime in place in time for the next fishing season <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that that is a question on which i need to elaborate <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble viscount will not mind if i do not say anything that would anticipate the outcome of the competition which is now in its final stages <e> <s> however i can say that we hope to announce the outcome of this competition by the end of the year <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am afraid that i am inhibited in answering the noble lords questions in any substantive way as i was when answering the questions of the noble viscount lord hanworth <e> <s> however i can assure the noble lord that all the relevant considerations will be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only repeat that we shall take into account all relevant considerations <e>", "<cs> my lords we anticipate that the system upon which we eventually decide will come into service in the early s <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the information which has been published by boeing to which my noble friend refers but i would suggest that he should address detailed questions about that information to boeing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to be slightly evasive but we are in the final stages of the competition <e> <s> the sort of points which the noble lord is putting to me are points which we shall have to consider and reach a view on during the final stages of this competition <e> <s> therefore i hope that the noble lord will forgive me if i do not go further <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> however we shall continue to urge the spanish government to follow our lead by removing their guard <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to say that i have temporarily forgotten the date upon which we removed our guard <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall very happily ascertain that date and let my noble friend know <e> <s> we do not know why the spaniards have not yet removed their guard but my right honourable and learned friend the foreign secretary will be seeing his spanish counterpart just after christmas and will certainly be taking up this matter with him then <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> as i indicated to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter a moment ago this matter will most certainly be on the agenda when my right honourable and learned friend the foreign secretary meets his spanish counterpart after christmas <e> <s> as for removing the gates the gates are i understand now permanently open <e> <s> i am not certain therefore whether removing them would serve any further useful purpose <e> <s> if i could revert to the question put to me by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter a moment ago <e> <s> i understand that our guard was removed on st july last <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to make fresh provision for the ministry of defence police <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords the only export of uranium from the rssing mine of which i am aware was i think taken by the cegb <e> <s> i understand that that contract has now ended and supplies therefore are not now coming from that source <e> <s> as for south african incursions into angola as the noble lord will well know we have roundly condemned those on every occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i have always taken the view that the best place for cubans is in cuba and that remains the essence of our position <e> <s> but we think that this matter is best taken forward within the context of the united nations plan <e> <s> there is no other plan on the table and we think that that is the way we should proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords cuban withdrawal was not of course part of the security council resolution nor do we recognise it as a precondition for a namibia settlement <e> <s> but the south africans have made it clear that they will not agree to implementation of resolution unless a satisfactory arrangement on cubans is found <e> <s> we certainly think as i indicated earlier that cuban withdrawal could create the best conditions for a lasting namibia settlement <e>", "<cs> my lords if i can go to the essence of the noble lords supplementary we certainly believe that the result of the policy should be an opportunity for the people of namibia to choose for themselves the sort of government that they require <e> <s> that of course is what the united nations plan is all about <e>", "<cs> my lords not for the first time if the noble lord will allow me to say so he expresses a view of considerable interest but not widely held elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear it is rather a question of the chicken and the egg <e> <s> as the noble lord will be well aware the south africans have said that if the cuban troops go then they will have no cause to go into angola <e>", "<cs> my lords the south africans have made it clear that they accept the purport of resolution and would like to see a solution based on it <e>", "<cs> my lords as we have consistently made clear a favourable outcome to the contadora process requires the utmost restraint on all sides which includes a reduction in arms levels in the area <e> <s> the government continue to work for a political solution to the regions problems and believe that the next ec central america and contadora foreign ministers meeting will contribute to this <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not normal practice to comment on individual equipment export matters <e> <s> however in this particular case the government have made it clear that they do not believe that the problems of the region can be solved by armed force and have called for a reduction in arms levels <e> <s> a supply of blowpipe would be inconsistent with this policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that that is a question for me <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the position was outlined by my noble friend lady young on th april in a written answer to the noble lord lord kennet <e>", "<cs> my lords if i can refer to the report which appeared in <e>", "<cs> my lords the united states systems are not systems of last resort as is our strategic system <e> <s> as for the other shortcomings of cruise missiles i invite the noble lord to study what i have said <e> <s> i listed more than one <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for intervening but i am afraid that my noble friend is out of order in speaking in a foreign language <e>", "<cs> my lords i am on the list to speak now if i have your lordships permission to do so for a second time in this debate <e> <s> however it occurs to me that much that needs to be said in answer to the various points that have been raised has already been said <e> <s> therefore i should like to say to your lordships that i shall cull carefully the columns of <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend will know that the increase to which i referred in the main answer is part of the current expansion plan for the territorial army <e> <s> a number of new units are being rasied all over the country and i shall be very happy to write to my noble friend with details <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot deny that there are shortages in certain areas for example in junior officers <e> <s> but we are working very hard to overcome the problem <e> <s> it is i think caused by the fact that junior officers are at a stage in their lives when the other pressures upon them are very considerable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very well aware of the problem to which my noble friend refers <e> <s> i am pleased to say that encouraging progress is being made towards resolving it and i hope that an announcement will be possible shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords the units that perhaps have less success relatively speaking in recruiting are those where the other attractions are greater <e> <s> if there is any more detailed information to give again i shall be very happy to write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords that goes without saying <e>", "<cs> my lords the pay of soldiers in the territorial army is directly related to the pay of their opposite numbers in the regular forces and is paid therefore on a daily basis <e> <s> i am not sure that the solution to the problem to which the noble lord refers lies in the direction of pay on which i think broadly there is satisfaction <e> <s> i believe that what we need to do is to assist members of the territorial army wherever we can to accommodate the other pressures on their lives particularly in their jobs and perhaps within their families <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly give all the information i can to my noble friend <e> <s> of course a copy of the letter will go to the library <e>", "<cs> my lords nothing sinister was meant by that answer <e> <s> the fact is that service in the territorial army is a part-time occupation and many people have other ways in which they think they can profitably spend their free time <e>", "<cs> my lords i think my noble friend is right <e> <s> morale is very high in the territorial army <e> <s> but during the time of the previous adminstration it almost sank without sight <e>", "<cs> my lords that is just the problem to which my noble friend lord ridley referred <e> <s> it is something with which we have been grappling for some time and as i said in answer to my noble friend we hope to be able to make an announcement shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords as i made clear to your lordships yesterday the united kingdom deterrent with trident will remain a tiny percentage of the strategic arsenals of the united states and the ussr <e> <s> as is well known to your lordships we have made it clear that if us and soviet strategic arsenals were to be very substantially reduced and if no significant change had occurred in soviet defensive capabilities we should review our position and consider how best we could contribute to arms control in the light of the reduced threat <e>", "<cs> my lords we heard figures yesterday about how we will increase the size of trident <e> <s> i think the noble lord lord irving said we were planning an increase of per cent <e> <s> if i remember rightly the noble lord inadvertently gave some other incorrect figures yesterday <e> <s> that was another of them <e> <s> the true ratio is not <e>", "<cs> my lords i had understood from the various utterances of the noble lord lord mayhew and others that the policy of the alliance was to allow the deterrent to rust away <e> <s> so what will happen then to the negotiations i am not sure <e>", "<cs> my lords it is of course essential to the effectiveness of the deterrent that at least one boat is at sea at all times <e> <s> we have made it clear that we may not necessarily use the maximum warhead capability which is involved in trident <e>", "<cs> my lords the united states does intend to deploy trident <e> <s> the noble lords question does not therefore arise <e>", "<cs> no my lords it does no such thing <e> <s> i said that we may or may not deploy the full capability of trident when the time comes <e> <s> that will depend upon the threat as we then assess it <e> <s> i think that is the clear answer to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i endeavoured to explain yesterday that for a deterrent to be effective and to deter we have to have both the capability and the will to use it <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe for one moment any more i think than the noble lord that there will be a majority in the house of commons for the cancellation of trident after the next election <e> <s> as for the proposition that the total elimination of nuclear weapons now would somehow make the world a safer place i must beg to differ with the noble lord <e> <s> i think that that would make conventional war much more likely <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to every noble lord for his welcome to this measure <e> <s> the noble lord lord graham asked me first about the composition of the police committee <e> <s> i can tell him that the chairman will be the second permanent under-secretary of the ministry of defence and the vice-chairman will be the vice-chief of the defence staff ministry of defence <e> <s> there will be a number of other ministry of defence officers and officials on the committee <e> <s> in addition there will be members nominated by the home office and the scottish office <e> <s> the chief constable and deputy chief constable of the ministry of defence police will be in attendance <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure it will be open to the defence police federation to make a request in writing such as the noble lord suggests <e> <s> i think it would then be a matter for the permanent members of the committee to decide how to proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know the answer to that question <e> <s> perhaps i may ascertain the position and let my noble friend know <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i have already answered that question <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord referred also to the answer that my noble friend the lord president gave a few weeks ago <e> <s> i do not think i have anything to add to those two comprehensive replies <e>", "<cs> at the outset i should like to be associated with the tributes that have been paid to my noble friend lord inglewood with regard to his lifelong interest in police matters for which i know he is held in great esteem and affection by all police forces <e> <s> i know that his amendment is inspired with the best interests of the mdp at heart and your lordships will be interested to know that a recommendation for such a scheme was made by the ministrys own police review committee under sir ewen broadbent <e> <s> indeed i am happy to be able to reassure my noble friend that the bill as drafted allows for such a scheme in clause a <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to my noble friend for raising this point <e> <s> i shall begin by making a distinction between when the mdp is within the establishment which it may be called upon to protect and when it is outside such a place <e> <s> inside the establishments which broadly speaking are those in the possession or under the control of the mod visiting forces ordnance factories and dockyards the powers of the mdp will not change <e> <s> when in those establishments its members have full powers of a constable covering all types of crime in the same manner as for a home department police constable <e> <s> when ouside those establishments mdp powers are more restricted <e> <s> under existing statutes it has constabulory powers in great britain in relation to crown property and service personnel including the property and personnel of visiting forces and international military headquarters and the property of ordnance factories and dockyards <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it is manifestly the case that if we were to replace our existing nuclear deterrent with a comparable non-nuclear deterrent we would need many thousands more men and women than we have today and it is certainly our view that that would involve some form of conscription <e>", "<cs> my lords the selection process that is presently in place is designed to ensure that those people who enter the armed forces are competent to carry out their duties after the appropriate training <e> <s> i do not think there is any evidence to suggest that the large numbers of people who would be required to fulfil the policies of the party opposite could be found by that volunteer means <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the

of south africa towards the independence of namibia it is committed to the united nations plan as the noble lord will be aware <e> <s> it is now up to all parties concerned to implement it <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to intervene to repeat a statement which has already been made in another place by my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary of state for defence procurement <e>", "<cs> i shall first explain the circumstances about my repeating a statement made in another place <e> <s> in fact it was a private notice question in the other place which it would have been entirely proper for my honourable friend to answer <e> <s> unfortunately the right honourable member for llanelli was not in his place when the private notice question was called and my honourable friend therefore thinking quickly on his feet changed it into <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may briefly answer the noble and learned lord my right honourable friend has indicated his preferred way forward so far as concerns devonport but he has not reached a final decision <e> <s> i should like to underline that <e> <s> he has invited the trade unions to call upon him again towards the middle of next month with their views and it will certainly not be until after that meeting that he will reach final conclusions on that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is right to raise the points that she has raised <e> <s> as she says she has raised some of them on earlier occasions <e> <s> on the question of the training of young people i know i have given her one or two answers previously <e> <s> i shall be happy to write to my noble friend with some more information if i can do that <e> <s> in regard to future parliamentary accountability in this matter of course the size of the naval programme and the work that emanates from it is very much subject to parliamentary scrutiny and my noble friend will be absolutely entitled to table questions on that matter as the need arises <e>", "<cs> my lords had my noble friend taken an active part in the legislation that we considered he would have been aware that in fact the ownership of the dockyards is not being changed by this legislation or by the arrangements that we are now discussing <e> <s> the ownership of the assets remains vested in my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e> <s> what we are talking about is the management of the dockyards <e> <s> it is the case that a number of major defence contractors are a lot more than per cent <e> <s> owned by overseas interests <e> <s> what is important is that the security interests of this country be properly sustained <e> <s> we do that by a very careful system of scrutiny and procedures and those scrutinies and procedures will apply in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly do not see why they should not <e>", "<cs> my lords this matter has been under discussion and consultation for two or three years at least <e> <s> i am totally persuaded that continued uncertainty is not in the least desirable and for that reason i think we should agree to get on with these arrangements just as soon as we can <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me that the cause of the difficulty to which the noble lord has referred is the fact that hostages were taken in the first place <e> <s> the right way forward therefore would be for those hostages to be released <e>", "<cs> my lords our policy on the sale of defence equipment to iran and to iraq too for that matter because they are both locked in a most unhappy conflict as the noble lord will know is well known <e> <s> as part of our scrupulously maintained impartiality in this conflict we refuse to sell to either side defence equipment which will significantly enhance their capability to prolong or exacerbate the conflict <e> <s> the detailed guidelines were set out by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs in another place on th october and those guidelines remain in force <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i said any such thing <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i can go any further than to say that that project has been found to be wholly in accordance with our policy and naturally we shall ensure that the necessary assurances are in place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not necessarily convinced that that would be a good idea <e> <s> it is sometimes better for battalions to have a set period in the province or in any other theatre for that matter and two years fits in well with the other duties which they have to perform <e>", "<cs> my lords we naturally keep the level of forces available in northern ireland under very careful and continuous review <e> <s> as the noble lord will be aware their role is to support the ruc and their strength is calculated for that purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords appropriate units take their turn to serve in northern ireland including the royal air force regiment and indeed the royal marines <e>", "<cs> my lords i am bound to agree with my noble friend <e> <s> i have never ceased to be amazed at the dedication and enthusiasm of our forces in northern ireland in very difficult circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that the noble lord is right in what he said <e> <s> we have not announced a specific date for the withdrawal of forces from northern ireland but we are hoping to look again at the level later this year <e>", "<cs> my lords currently personnel in the resident battalions in northern ireland on average spend about per cent <e> <s> of nights away from their resident location <e> <s> no figures are kept for nights spent actually on operations <e>", "<cs> yes my lords it is an average figure but my noble friend will be reassured to learn that recently the average has been reduced from per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i intended to begin by staggering to my feet and protesting that i was exhausted which indeed i am but i think that that would be a shameful proceeding in the context of the speech of the noble lord lord brockway and his tenacity when asking his question and sitting through the debate this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that explanation from the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord may have forgotten that there has been a sea change in our relationship with argentina when of course they invaded the falkland islands in <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord cares to table a question on that matter i or another minister will be happy to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can answer the noble lord by referring to the second of the four points which were agreed between my right honourable friend and the president the year before last <e> <s> it is that sdi-related deployment would in view of treaty obligations have to be a matter for negotiation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of any change in the united states position in this matter <e> <s> as your lordships will be aware we have consistently welcomed assurances that while broad interpretation of the treaty is legally sustainable the sdi programme is being conducted within a narrow interpretation <e> <s> we are not aware of any new decision and we look forward to continuing consultations with our american friends <e>", "<cs> my lords unhappily we have no such assurance as yet because we are still embarked upon the research programme <e>", "<cs> my lords the soviet union is indeed embarked upon a major research programme into matters of this kind <e> <s> it has been doing so for or years at least <e> <s> that is what makes the position so curious <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that we remain in close and continuous touch with the united states government on these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i would remind the noble lord that the position of the united states government and the united kingdom government was set out very clearly when the prime minister met the president in december <e> <s> it is encapsulated in the four points with which i suspect the noble lord is familiar <e>", "<cs> my lords the exent to which trident will be more capable than polaris will depend upon a number of factors notably the effectiveness of soviet defences which cannot be judged in detail until the time comes <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that the great danger that british troops in germany now face is the prospect of the policy of noble lords opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> there is no intention of moving in the way that the noble lord suggests <e> <s> the cancellation terms that are being incorporated in the contract which exists for the first submarine and which will be in place before long for the second submarine seek only to be fair and reasonable to the parties concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords yes indeed <e> <s> my noble friend is right <e> <s> by the time that trident comes to be deployed in the mid-s a much greater range of defences will have to be penetrated <e> <s> for all that it will be able to achieve trident will represent a smaller proportion of soviet strategic warheads than polaris did in even if the currently proposed per cent <e> <s> reductions in strategic arsenals are to be agreed between the super powers <e>", "<cs> my lords i doubt whether that has much to do with it <e> <s> soviet defences and offensive capability continue to grow unabated <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of trident is to deter any potential aggressor from launching an attack upon us <e> <s> we can only do that by having a credible response <e>", "<cs> my lords the basis of the system that we are now acquiring and will deploy in the mid-s is that by that time the existing polaris system will be coming to the end of its useful life <e> <s> it is therefore necessary to have a new system in place <e> <s> we are certain that by then we will have to penetrate a wide range of new defensive capabilities <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend puts his finger on a very appropriate point <e> <s> the whole effectiveness of an independent nuclear deterrent is the uncertainty which it plants in the mind of the potential aggressor <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that <e> <s> i said that russian research in this area is proceeding apace <e> <s> what the success of that research is i cannot yet say <e> <s> i certainly cannot yet say for certain what the scale of the defences will be in the mid-s <e>", "<cs> my lords as mr weinberger has said and as i have said in this house on a number of occasions and as the noble lord has reminded us soviet research in this area has been proceeding for or years at least <e> <s> therefore if we are to achieve a system of our own we need to get a move on <e> <s> the sdi programme has started only comparatively recently <e> <s> precisely what success the soviets have so far had i cannot say <e> <s> however it would be a brave and i believe unwise man who assumed that they will not have some success between now and the mid-s <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is certainly quite right to remind your lordships that by the mid-s the polaris system will be coming to the end of its useful life and will have to be replaced with one system or another <e> <s> we believe that the trident system is the most cost-effective way of doing that not least because of the improvement in soviet anti-submarine capability as my noble friend points out which will to some extent be countered by the fact that the trident submarines will have some times more sea room in which to conceal themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the fact that some members of the opposition are not as daft as their leaders <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that that is a question which needs an answer <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may be assured that ministers have examined this matter <e> <s> indeed i have given the noble lord some of the answers to which he has referred <e> <s> however i am not prepared to give information which would be of value to our potential enemies and i hope that the noble lord is not prepared to do that either <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the fact that the noble lord lord mayhew once served in the ministry of defence that makes this question so puzzling <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that answering the noble lord in the way that i did was propaganda <e>", "<cs> my lords that is why it is so important to ensure that that never happens <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand the matter and i confess to some confusion here the <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of trident is to replace an independent deterrent which by the mid-s will be becoming rapidly less credible <e> <s> that is why we have ordered the system which we have ordered and as a matter of fact the number of warheads available to trident at the time of its introduction will be substantially fewer than the opposition will have at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords the libyan connection to which the noble lord refers relates i understand to the construction there of an irrigation facility <e> <s> let me be quite clear about the extent of libyan involvement in this country <e> <s> there are i understand two libyan nationals based in the brown and root office i think that is the firm to which the noble lord refers in kingston <e> <s> brown and roots dockyard team operates from quite separate offices in colliers wood to which the libyans will not of course be allowed access <e> <s> the two projects are quite separate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to give the noble lord the assurance for which he asks <e> <s> we have had a successful competition with regard to both of the dockyards <e> <s> but i emphasise that my right honourable friend has not quite made up his mind with regard to the devonport contract <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will forgive me that is a rather different question <e> <s> however i can tell him that my right honourable friend has now completed his consultations with <e>", "<cs> my lords intellectual property rights are not one of the major issues that have arisen during our consultations on these contracts but the noble lord can be assured that such as they are they will be properly protected <e>", "<cs> my lords i should perhaps underline the fact that brown and root uk ltd which is a united kingdom company but controlled by an american parent will have just per cent <e> <s> of the shareholding in devonport management ltd that is the maximum limit that we have set under the contract as the noble and learned lord will be aware <e> <s> the government have carefully examined the issue and we are quite satisfied that we have arrived at proper arrangements <e> <s> but i emphasise that my right honourable friend has not yet reached a final conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier these libyans have nothing whatever to do with the matter that we are now discussing <e> <s> they are concerned with the construction of an irrigation facility in that country which has no connection whatever with the activities of brown and root so far as the dockyard is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords to the best of my knowledge and belief there are no other libyans involved <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the libyan involvement relates only to the irrigation facility contract to which i have referred <e> <s> i therefore presume that the libyans will return to their country when that contract is completed <e>", "<cs> my lords access to our most sensitive equipment is determined on a case by case and a need to know basis <e> <s> it is not determined by the nationality of those involved though clearly those from some nationalities would have very great difficulty indeed in persuading us that they had business to have access say to our nuclear facilities <e> <s> as for brown and root itself i remind your lordships that that company very recently received the queens award for technological achievement which is an award not lightly given to unreliable companies <e>", "<cs> my lords the safeguarding of gibraltars heritage is a domestic matter for the government of gibraltar as is the use of defence lands that are transferred to them similarly responsibility for planning procedures rests with that government <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it would be appropriate for us to proceed as my noble friend suggests <e> <s> the government of gibraltar are responsible for these matters and we have no power to direct them if that is what my noble friend has in mind or for that matter to impose what we know they would find unacceptable conditions upon the transfer of the land <e> <s> the availability of land in gibralter is very strictly limited and thus sites for development even important developments of the kind that my noble friend refers to are hard to find <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are not directly responsible for providing money for these developments but we generally transfer the land free of charge and that is a considerable contribution <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords <e> <s> the government are always willing to offer advice to the gibraltar government on this matter but i emphasise that it is only advice <e> <s> indeed we sit on the committee that deals with these things <e> <s> that committee is called the development and planning commission which has four gibraltarians and two british members as the voting committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that if we were to attach such a condition these days it would be regarded as undesirable <e>", "<cs> yes of course my lords <e> <s> although the dockyard is now under commercial management in gibraltar gibraltar remains a very worthwhile and useful facility for the royal navy <e> <s> indeed even the dockyard itself is currently undertaking quite a bit of royal naval work <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure in what circumstances the noble lord thinks that the document is being used in a situation which he would deplore <e> <s> i know of no such circumstance <e> <s> but if there is such a circumstance and he can tell me about it then i shall be happy to look into it <e>", "<cs> my lords although we do all that we can to make the best possible use of our existing training areas current land holdings simply do not <e>", "<cs> my lords i assure the noble lord that the consultation that he is seeking takes place on a regular and continuing basis <e> <s> indeed i have been responsible for quite a bit of it in recent times although now a different minister is responsible <e> <s> we take our responsibilities very seriously in so far as preserving the environment on the land over which we train <e> <s> in many cases we are told that the presence of the military is a positive benefit to the environment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to have to explain to the noble lord that classified documents are available to other departments but not to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i assure the noble lord that the document is not being used in that way because it does not contain any criteria <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that the noble lord has seen a copy of the document <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord has been invited to see the document he will first have to be authorised to receive classified information and that i do not think has happened yet <e>", "<cs> my lords there was no committee set up for this purpose <e> <s> baron was a comparatively junior officer in the british army who conducted the study for the benefit of his senior officers and not for further dissemination <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that i can give no such assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their contribution to this debate and indeed for their welcome if qualified to the order that i have proposed to bring before your lordships <e> <s> perhaps i may answer one point by the noble lord lord rochester about the possible scope of the board being too limited <e> <s> the noble lord may be interested and reassured to know that my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary of state for employment discussed this matter with the eitb chairman as recently as th march <e> <s> as a result i understand that msc funds will be made available to help eitb to commission an independent survey into the use of engineering skills in other sectors <e> <s> indeed i referred to this during my earlier remarks <e> <s> to be frank we are a little short of information in this area <e> <s> i very much hope that with the information provided by the survey to hand it will be possible to move forward in a way that the noble lord would approve <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i totally follow the point which the noble baroness has made about the amount of money but i shall be happy to be instructed by the noble baroness on some other occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords the directive was in if i remember rightly <e> <s> between and noble lords opposite and their right honourable friends had an opportunity to do something about it though they did not <e> <s> indeed it remained for the conservative government who arrived in to do something which we did as soon as the opportunity arose in as the noble lord is aware <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord lucas of chilworth i beg to move the motion standing in his name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for the warm welcome he has given the proposal that i have ventured to bring before your lordships this evening <e> <s> perhaps i may finish on a personal note <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state has been very much the architect and supporter of this project from the start indeed he has given it his close and continuing personal attention during the preparation of the various orders and their passage through the other place <e> <s> he was in fact good enough to assist me in preparing my remarks to address to your lordships this evening <e> <s> my right honourable friend has made it clear that he does not intend to stand at the next general election <e> <s> i venture to suggest that this project will remain as a memorial to his time in the welsh office and a very splendid memorial it will be <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we have looked very carefully at the point which the noble lord raises but i am afraid we have had to conclude that topographical and geographical factors which constrain the selection of a site very considerably are such that there is no prospect of moving it elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly share my noble friends view about the importance of this facility <e> <s> he may be assured that we shall fully follow the concepts that he suggested in his supplementary question <e> <s> but we must too do our very best to ensure that environmental considerations are fully taken into account in the design and construction of this facility <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right but then the whole essence of our policy and of our equipment including fylingdales is to ensure that no such conflict should ever happen <e>", "<cs> my lords fylingdales is not part of the strategic defence initiative <e>", "<cs> my lords we are in the process of modernising the facility at fylingdales <e> <s> it is not a new facility as i am sure the noble baroness will understand <e> <s> as i said in answer to the noble lord lord hunt a moment ago there are very stringent topographical geographical and indeed operational criteria which have to be met with regard to this facility or modernised facility as it will become <e> <s> that meant i am afraid that it was not possible to find another site to meet the purpose <e> <s> having said that i have accepted and do accept the need to ensure that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether the noble lord is talking about the work now going on to modernise the station <e> <s> if that is what he has in mind i can tell him that her majestys government are satisfied that the modernisation of the system fully conforms with us obligations under the abm treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a point of view but i have accepted at least twice this afternoon already that we need to ensure that the facility represents the minimum possible conflict with environmental considerations <e> <s> having said that a large antenna of this kind will create some sort of an impact wherever we put it i am afraid <e>", "<cs> my lords the details of the modernisation were submitted to the north yorkshire moors national park committee last year <e> <s> it will be a new pyramid-shaped structure to replace the so-called golf ball structures that are there at present <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble viscount that we looked at all possible solutions to the problem but the conclusion we reached was that the right way to proceed was with the modernisation of the facility <e>", "<cs> my lords i can certainly assure the noble lord that we shall continue with the detailed consultation procedures that we have always followed in the past in connection with this matter <e> <s> as he may be aware the national park committee has decided not to raise any objection to the proposed development although i understand it is regretted by the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords neither i nor any of my ministerial colleagues has for a moment been misleading anybody <e> <s> the noble lord referred to certain correspondence which took place in march when i in my then capacity wrote to the honourable gentlemen mr wareing the member of parliament for liverpool <e> <s> the position i described to him then was accurate and remains accurate to the extent of course that events have moved on <e>", "<cs> my lords we were very much in favour of the proposals agreed at montebello which were described in the communiqu issued at that time <e> <s> as i said in my original answer certain proposals have since been brought forward by the supreme allied commander addressed of course to individual nations <e> <s> in so far as those proposals affect the united kingdom we are considering them very carefully and will reach our decisions in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords that sounds a rather comprehensive supplementary question if i may say so <e> <s> naturally we shall be supporting any measure of disarmament that is both balanced and verifiable <e>", "<cs> no my lords it is not the case that i or any of my colleagues have inadvertently or otherwise misled noble lords or members of the other place <e> <s> the agreement reached at montebello was an agreement in principle <e> <s> the detailed proposals were brought forward subsequently by the supreme allied commander and it is those that we are now considering <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a point of view my noble friend is entitled to hold and an opinon i am sometimes tempted to follow <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that question time would not be long enough <e>", "<cs> thirdly i know that the noble lord lord graham acknowledged in your lordships debate last week the practical difficulties that could be encountered <e> <s> it must be recognised that the imposition of retrospective provisions would create severe problems and would lead no doubt to many examples of unfairness since the ministry of defence and ultimately the courts would be unable to consider and properly assess those old cases where the necessary evidence and witnesses are no longer available <e> <s> even in comparatively recent cases of death injury or illness prospective claimants will not have considered the possibility of raising a common law claim because of the bar established by section of the act <e> <s> so material evidence essential when pursuing a claim through the courts may well have been lost <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so i am afraid that the noble lord is labouring under a very considerable misapprehension <e> <s> there is certainly no question of the government seeking to influence the commercial judgment of british aerospace in its dealings with its new subsidiary royal ordnance or for that matter in any other way <e> <s> the future of the factory at enfield will be secured by it becoming as efficient as possible <e> <s> as the noble lord may be aware we made it clear before we disposed of royal ordnance to british aerospace that for example the order for the second tranche of the sa weapon was available to the new owners of enfield if they thought fit and we are now waiting to hear british aerospaces decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of any outstanding details that have not been settled <e> <s> of course the sale of royal ordnance was a sale of shares so the whole of the enterprise including all its existing schemes and liabilities has passed to the new owners <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord puts an entirely hypothetical question to me <e> <s> as he is aware and as i have already said british aerospace has made it quite clear that it intends to operate royal ordnance as a single entity <e> <s> there is no question of it chopping up royal ordnance bit by bit <e>", "<cs> my lords the resolution of the question of the ownership of the intellectual property rights was one of the more complex matters that had to be agreed with the new owners during the course of the discussions that we had with them <e> <s> i am happy to say that agreement was reached <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right to point out that the royal ordnance factory at enfield has been manufacturing small arms for a long period of time and with great success <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot deny that there are some anomalies in the pension scheme to which my noble friend refers <e> <s> the fact remains however that the cost of correcting all those anomalies and such correction could not be confined to the armed forces pension scheme would be very considerable <e> <s> if it were necessary to make such correction retrospective as i believe my noble friend has in mind i do not believe that we would ever make any improvements at all to those schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords it depends to which anomalies the noble lord is referring but if we were to take all the ones currently under discussion the cost would be several hundred million pounds <e>", "<cs> my lords the officers pension society is the principal body which makes representations on these matters <e> <s> the society was quite recently received by my honourable friend the under-secretary for the armed forces <e> <s> i know that he is in constant touch with the royal british legion on this and other matters but i am certain that he would be willing to receive a further delegation if it wished to bring one <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no injustice because everyone under the scheme receives what they are entitled to receive <e> <s> the difficulty is that if when we make improvements as we do from time to time we are to make them retrospective then naturally we should have to take the cost of doing that into account in reaching our decision <e> <s> the result would be that some of the desirable improvements could not then be made even for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a number of anomalies as they are called which are drawn to our attention from time to time no doubt from a real sense of concern about those matters <e> <s> different people of course raise different difficulties <e> <s> if we were to take all of the difficulties into account and some of them are not as serious as others and put right the apparent grievance retrospectively the cost would be huge <e> <s> we could not confine the correction of the anomalies just to the armed forces pension scheme <e> <s> clearly similar aspects would have to he corrected if they existed in the pension schemes for example of the civil servants <e> <s> thus the cost would be astronomic several hundred million pounds <e> <s> that would be money that we would not in future be able to provide for other most well deserved improvements and that is why we cannot proceed as the noble lord would wish <e>", "<cs> my lords many people draw attention to what they see as the injustice in their particular case <e> <s> other people sometimes take a view different from that which one might take about ones own circumstances <e> <s> we do our best to maintain the position as far as the future is concerned but to correct some of the anomalies and they undoubtedly exist in a retrospective way which is what we are being asked to do confronts us with the difficulties to which i have referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not certain to which group of people the noble lord refers <e> <s> as i have explained the cost of retrospection is very <e>", "<cs> my lords i do my best to keep all such parables in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so that is a question of retrospection <e> <s> what is being asked in the context of the particular point raised is that we should apply the improvements which were allowed just prior to the falklands campaign to those people who were affected by the second world war <e> <s> that means retrospection and that is the difficulty to which i have referred <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier the officers pension society saw my honourable friend the under-secretary of state for the armed forces recently and i understand that he plans to receive it again in the near future <e>", "<cs> my lords i dare say there are a variety of ways in which the matter can be described <e> <s> however the difficulty is the one to which i have referred <e>", "<cs> my lords that is no doubt one of the matters that my right honourable friend will take into account during the course of his review <e> <s> there is a bunching of bank holidays at that time of the year and this is the real problem that is now being addressed <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord seems to think that he speaks for all the working people in this country and with respect to the noble lord i doubt whether that is so <e> <s> i know that many workers would prefer a wider spread of holiday dates and would find a holiday between easter and the end of may not particularly valuable or convenient <e> <s> tourist interests certainly would prefer a wider date <e>", "<cs> my lords that is certainly a consideration that my right honourable friend will want to take into account <e> <s> but i should add that there is not much call for a bank holiday in the middle of the winter when the weather might not be particularly clement <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will not be surprised if i say that his suggestion finds considerable sympathy so far as i am concerned but whether that sympathy will spread wider remains to be seen <e> <s> as for st george i understand that among his many distinctions he is the patron saint of the russian cavalry and i am not entirely certain that my noble friend who put the question had that in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends debate was the last or perhaps the most recent in a long line of discussions on the point to which my noble friend refers all stemming of course from as far back as when the easter act came into force <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall ensure that my right honourable friend takes that point into account <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so there is not a lot of sense in having a bank holiday in the middle of the week <e> <s> the most important objection to such a course is that it disrupts some important industrial processes with the result that staff have to take the whole week off <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right when he says that the so-called may day holiday at the beginning of may was introduced comparatively recently <e> <s> indeed when that happened i understand that the scots promptly took the holiday at the end of may as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend is right to point out the historical importance of this particular occasion which i suppose goes to show that interest in st may is not confined to those who have been representing views from the other side of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i really do not think that a useful purpose is served by trying to make this into a political discussion <e> <s> the important aspect is to consider the convenience particularly of those who take this holiday <e> <s> i think it is right to consider whether it is appropriate to have all these bank holidays bunched at the beginning of the summer <e>", "<cs> my lords nobody is more keen to recognise the contribution of the working people to the well-being of this nation than i am but the fact remains that there may be a more convenient date upon which to make that recognition <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that response to my proposal in respect of this order <e> <s> i shall deal with some of the points raised by the noble lord but i fear that i may be unable to deal with them all now <e> <s> i shall very happily write to the noble lord with further information where i can <e>", "<cs> my lords my recollection is that we have not yet reached a conclusion on the matter but perhaps i might be allowed to take further advice and write to the noble lord <e> <s> my recollection might be at fault <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think the noble lord is right in either of his suppositions <e> <s> as for the value of the site far from the figure of million which i think appeared in the press <e>", "<cs> my lords our assessment of the site value is million <e> <s> that of course is <e>", "<cs> my lords yes it is of course our duty to ensure that we can procure our weapons and associated products when we need them from time to time <e> <s> current orders at royal ordnance which are being executed at enfield will i understand if not completed in time be transferred to nottingham <e> <s> additional orders have been placed with royal ordnance for example for the sa weapon which i gather will be made at nottingham <e> <s> we are satisfied that royal ordnance will retain important capacity in this area <e> <s> in any event it is not the only company in this country that can meet our requirements <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed <e> <s> i regard that as an important advantage <e>", "<cs> my lords the national interest requires that we retain the necessary industrial capacity to meet our requirements in times of tension or war <e> <s> we are entirely satisfied that that position is covered <e>", "<cs> my lords the increase in production and productivity to which i referred in my original answer indicates that our manufacturing industry is becoming very much more competitive in world markets <e> <s> success will lie in increasing this productivity and in improving still further the significant success in export markets <e> <s> incidentally while the manufacturing industry has been performing as i have indicated employment in service industries rose by to the figure of <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not agree with any of that <e> <s> the fact is that industry was in a declining state in when we came into power <e> <s> it has taken a considerable time because of the disarray that we found at that time to bring the position back to a satisfactory level <e> <s> added to that of course we have had to face difficulties in world markets and that makes the attainment of the goals to which i have referred today all the more satisfactory <e> <s> the noble lord might be interested to know that there are now important signs that investment in manufacturing industry is also increasing in a very satisfactory way <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is right to point to the comparison with other nations my lords <e> <s> the position is broadly as my noble friend indicates <e> <s> it might also be of interest to your lordships that profitability which is so important in manufacturing industry is now the highest since <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has a very short memory <e> <s> perhaps he remembers as i do the winter of discontent which led rightly to the dismissal of the labour government <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> although we continue to press the spanish authorities to remove the restrictions they have up to now refused to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not in a position to tell my noble friend exactly the spanish difficulties in this matter <e> <s> i can tell him that my right honourable and learned friend the foreign secretary raised it with his opposite number in spain earlier this year and plans to do so again in the not too distant future <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i can confirm that my right honourable and learned friend is having another meeting with the spanish foreign minister on th november <e> <s> my right honourable and learned <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it that is indeed the case <e>", "<cs> my lords the civil air transport package of measures was widely agreed with our european partners save for our spanish friends <e> <s> it was they who blocked agreement on it <e> <s> as for enlisting the aid of our nato allies with regard to military access to gibraltar we have certainly made clear our view on the inappropriateness of those restrictions by a fellow nato ally <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall repeat a statement about the flooding situation in wales which is now being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for wales <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend will allow me i should like to reply to the two noble lords who have so far spoken <e> <s> i say at the outset that it is the intention that the assistance provided to local authorities in this circumstance should be identical to that provided to local authorities in england following the storms at the end of last week <e> <s> the reason why the formula sounds as though it is a little different is that the threshold is apparently calculated differently in wales <e> <s> the result is that it has to be expressed in slightly different terms <e> <s> the intention certainly is there and the help should be exactly as it is provided to english authorities following the storms of last week <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord i have read the accounts and what is said to have taken place surrounding the accident <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will forgive me if i say that i should prefer to await the outcome of the inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords generally speaking the government do not expect to have to cover losses which should have been covered by insurance and which prudent farmers will have arranged for themselves <e> <s> where farmers have underinsured i imagine that similar considerations would apply <e> <s> i am not aware that there is any scheme for specific compensation in other circumstances <e> <s> i shall make inquiries and write to the noble lord if i am wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure what dispute the noble lord is referring to because i know of none <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that we have ordered six of these aircraft <e> <s> we have currently an option for a further two and we shall be making up our minds very shortly how we shall proceed in accordance with that option <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that it is always extreme financial difficulties which necessarily cause recipients to sell the award <e> <s> however where that is so it is right that they should have the benefit of all the other support that can be provided notably the war pension scheme and the various allowances available from other sources <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that the view expressed by my noble and gallant friend is one which is widely held by those of his colleagues who hold that fine decoration <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that we keep in touch with the victoria cross association on that matter <e> <s> i believe that the association also takes in members holding the george cross and very similar considerations apply in that case <e>", "<cs> my lords the principal body representing the interests and views of those people is the association which has been referred to by the noble lord lord irving <e> <s> however we keep in touch with the royal british legion on a whole range of matters <e>", "<cs> my lords no doubt the noble lord is right <e> <s> however the answer i gave was in the context of the united kingdom and of all the other benefits available to citizens of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly share the welcome accorded to the platform which i referred to and which reaffirms both the central position of the united states with regard to the defence of europe and the nuclear strategy we have adopted ever since the end of the second world war <e>", "<cs> my lords we are satisfied <e> <s> i should emphasise that the role of the two organisations is very different <e> <s> indeed i myself addressed the parliamentary assembly of the weu only last year <e>", "<cs> my lords nobody underestimates the importance of the weu certainly not this government <e> <s> we were instrumental in revitalising the union a couple of years or so ago <e> <s> my <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord is right <e> <s> there is a danger that there will be a proliferation of bodies of this kind all trying to achieve the same thing <e> <s> that is why it is important that all the respectable bodies such as the weu make sure that they take part in the activities appropriate to them <e>", "<cs> my lords as i mentioned just now the platform which was agreed at the recent weu meeting underlined the importance of the american contribution to the defence of europe <e> <s> that is why my noble friend lord rodney was right to point to president reagans welcome of that particular aspect <e>", "<cs> my lords nobody doubts the importance of ensuring the strength of our conventional weapons systems and other aspects of conventional defence <e> <s> we spend a great deal of time coming together in that particular way for example through the independent european programme group which has frequent meetings not least at ministerial level <e>", "<cs> my lords on the latter point i think it is important that the weu does not get involved in operational matters <e> <s> there would have been a risk of that if it had gone too far down the road which the noble lord indicates <e> <s> its contribution on the political aspects of the gulf situation was very welcome <e> <s> as to support for the inf agreement i can assure the noble lord that all the european allies including in particular those who are members of the western european union warmly welcome the agreement which is now in prospect <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult when gathering such statistics to determine to what sector the output of a service sector employee is related <e> <s> for example there are no doubt many service sector employees whose work is of benefit both to their own sector and to the manufacturing sector <e> <s> apportioning that output is difficult in terms of gathering statistics <e> <s> however we keep such matters under review <e> <s> i understand that a new set of statistics relating to is expected in a few months time i shall see if it can be conveyed to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that in some areas which formerly relied on what we have come to call the traditional heavy industries unemployment remains at an unacceptably high level <e> <s> the government have spent something approaching billion per annum on various schemes to help in those difficult areas <e> <s> it is gratifing to see the general level of unemployment coming down so sharply <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that it is always necessary to have a personnel officer before employing others <e> <s> nonetheless i am happy to see a rise in employment in whatever sector it may occur <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that there has been some misunderstanding about the document which the noble lord had in mind <e> <s> as far as i know there is no further memorandum of understanding to be published on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the united kingdom is not a signatory to the treaty to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> we are entirely satisfied that the modernisation programme for this installation now in prospect is in accordance with the obligations of the united states under that treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords the facility at raf fylingdales is very important <e> <s> it is also the case that there will be a number of opportunities for british contractors in the modernisation programme <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may be assured that i have revealed nothing to the noble lord lord hatch which he is not authorised to receive <e>", "<cs> my lords some noble lords opposite have been claiming in recent years that the united states sdi programme in which we are playing a part is entirely without purpose because the russians are not embarked on this kind of work <e> <s> we have constantly said that that is not the case and now mr gorbachev has confirmed that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord says that the russians disagree with us <e> <s> they would wouldnt they <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord says that these stations have been a bone of contention between ourselves and the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry <e> <s> i meant to say between the united states and the soviet union <e> <s> there are questions still to be answered about the station at krasnoyarsk as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i reject the proposition put forward by the noble lord <e> <s> the fact is that this is an existing facility at fylingdales which is being modernised <e> <s> in our view this modernisation is fully in accordance with us obligations under the abm treaty <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords if by both sides the noble lord is referring to iran and iraq who are involved in this unhappy conflict i think the best way forward lies in all the world community supporting the activities of the united nations secretary-general <e> <s> we shall certainly do that <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the matters that we shall have to investigate is the attitude of iran and the circumstances in which it might be willing to stop fighting <e> <s> but if we were to accept the proposition of the noble lord at its face value then we should not make any efforts at all to bring this conflict to an end and that is certainly not our policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am bound to say that we have been disappointed in the response of the soviet union in this matter of late <e> <s> however as the noble lord says there is a new spirit abroad certainly between the super powers and we hope that the soviet union as one of the five will agree that we should now be seeking to take this matter forward <e> <s> as we see it there is now a need for the security council to move to enforcement measures <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the united kingdom forces in the area operate in conjunction with other allied forces that is to say the united states france italy belgium and the netherlands <e> <s> we do not operate in conjunction with the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has a point but i think the way forward in this matter is to persuade all those who agreed to resolution in september to seek to have that resolution enforced <e> <s> i do not believe the way to do that is by ringing declarations it is by quiet active diplomacy <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am afraid that public discussion of these matters is not conducive to national security <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot add to the answers i have already given <e>", "<cs> no my lords that is not what i said <e> <s> what i said and what my noble friend said on an earlier occasion is that matters relating to national security are not for the public domain <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord accepted the principle that these matters are not in general for public discussion and then sought to ask me a question which related to those matters <e> <s> i regret that i cannot help him further <e>", "<cs> my lords the book to which the noble lord refers was indeed written by a member of another place but was not an official publication of any sort <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to reply to the question of the noble lord lord kennet i am bound to observe that this subject was extensively covered in considerable detail during a five-hour debate in your lordships house as recently as last wednesday not to mention in the starred question on th november to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> but i make no complaint about that <e> <s> the noble lord is entitled to ask whatever questions he likes whenever he likes and i shall do my best to answer <e> <s> but it will come as no surprise to noble lords who recall that five-hour debate if i say that the question tabled by the noble lord lord kennet does not permit of a simple answer <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for the united kingdom to interpret the abm treaty <e> <s> we are not parties to that treaty any more than is the noble lord if i may say so <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that as i say we are not parties to the treaty but we have indicated that we should support the narrower interpretation and hope that the united states will do so as well <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so the noble lord has advanced his position on the matter repeatedly over the past two or three years ever since i have had the responsibility for answering on occasions from the dispatch box <e> <s> i confess that the noble lords position has changed not a jot during that time <e> <s> however i believe that if he studies the arguments which i have put forward he will realise that the position is worthy of further consideration <e> <s> i shall give way to the noble lord lord kennet <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> there is no difficulty at least so far as i am aware as regards the abm treaty and the soviet system which is land-based and located in the soviet union <e> <s> however the fact that the united states does not have such a system makes it all the more important that it should proceed with research on a more modern system as it is now doing <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not a proposition in which we would be involved <e> <s> that would be something for the united states and the soviet union <e> <s> it does not sound to me like an arrangement which would enhance our security <e>", "<cs> my lords that is easy <e> <s> it is a very thorough modernisation <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i should counsel my noble friend to the effect that there is no magic solution just around the corner for this particular problem <e> <s> the system to which he refers is one which will measure the wind speed and direction from the satellite <e> <s> i have no doubt that this will be of great benefit to our forecasters but even that system will be subject to some shortcomings for example it will not be able to measure wind speed through cloud cover <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so i think that the idea that we shall be able to forecast accurately eight months ahead is somewhat fanciful <e> <s> as the noble lord pointed out there was some difficulty over the storm which struck the southern part of the united kingdom towards the end of last year <e> <s> that was a problem of hours not days or months <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that it is fair to say that short-term forecasting is an intelligent guess <e> <s> indeed drawing on my own experience in the aviation world the very short-term forecasting provided for that service for example is extremely good <e> <s> i should like to pay tribute to the meteorological office in that way <e> <s> however the noble lord is right that the longer-term forecasting is a much more difficult science and there is certainly no easy solution just around the corner <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that they do not operate at a profit <e> <s> the total cost of the meteorological office is some million a year and it earns about million in fees from various sources <e> <s> however my noble and learned friend is quite right its services are highly valued around the world <e> <s> for example there has recently been a programme of research in connection with rainfall in central africa to which the meteorological office has contributed most effectively and i understand to the considerable satisfaction of those who live in those parts <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> after the recent catastrophic storm my right honourable friend did ask the meteorological office itself to study what had gone wrong and at the same time asked two distinguished experts to look at the study which the meteorological office prepared <e> <s> i understand that both those reports are likely to be with ministers very shortly and certainly both will be published <e>", "<cs> my lords the meteorological office services are of course available to anybody who wants them <e> <s> as for the conference to which i think the noble lord lord irving of dartford referred i imagine that the meteorological office was represented at that conference <e> <s> perhaps i may inquire further into that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord referred to resources <e> <s> i have already mentioned in reply to my noble and learned friend the cost of the meteorological office which is around million a year about million of which is already deployed for research purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether that question exactly arises from the one on the order paper but i can confirm that i have heard of the strategy to which the noble lord refers <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so i think the noble lord is under a misapprehension <e> <s> there has been a long-standing policy agreed by the nato defence ministers which relates to a reduction in the number of nuclear warheads in europe over a period of years <e> <s> the recent inf agreement will not change that policy <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in the original answer the f is in fact an aircraft and it is what is known as a dual-capable aircraft <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not what i said <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will be aware we never discuss in detail our intelligence arrangements <e> <s> however the noble lord may be assured that the more general answer that i have already given applies to the particular <e>", "<cs> my lords we have no difficulty in principle with the idea of a united nations force <e> <s> indeed we contribute to united nations forces of other kinds around the world <e> <s> however we see very considerable practical difficulties in the way of a united nations naval force of the kind that i think the noble lord has in mind <e> <s> there has never been such a force as i am sure the noble lord will be aware and the difficulties of forming and operating one are formidable <e>", "<cs> my lords there are powerful arguments against commencing something which is almost certain to prove impossible <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is certainly right when he says that the threat faced by our forces and indeed by the other forces in the region is a continually changing one <e> <s> my noble friend may be assured that we keep the changing threat under careful and continuous review and adjust our arrangements accordingly <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord molloy pointed out there is considerable interchange of information between the commanders on the spot to avoid just the eventuality that the noble lord anticipates <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will be aware we do not discuss in detail the rules of engagement issued to our forces on the spot <e> <s> but so <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that we have not been dragged in as the noble lord says by anyone <e> <s> we are there because we chose to be there to protect british shipping and other qualified vessels <e>", "<cs> my lords we are there to try to reduce the temperature not to increase it <e> <s> i am not sure that the course that the noble lord proposes would necessarily contribute to that end <e> <s> we are anxious to ensure so far as we can that british shipping and the other vessels that are qualified for the protection of british forces in the area get as much protection as we can provide <e> <s> but we are not concerned to raise the temperature of the situation in the way that the noble lords action might <e>", "<cs> my lords that is if i may say so a very comprehensive question <e> <s> the answer would be a somewhat lengthy one perhaps unduly trespassing upon your lordships question time <e> <s> but for example co-ordinating rules of engagement would be a very difficult matter <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i can <e> <s> it is true as the noble lord said that some anxiety has been expressed not least by amnesty international recently <e> <s> my right honourable friend raised the matter when she was in kenya and it was therefore particularly satisfying to have the very robust response to her representations which emerged from president mois speech at the banquet at the end of her visit <e> <s> perhaps i may let the noble lord have the words that he used which were most reassuring <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the case as the noble lord said that amnesty international issued a report last year saying that there were some problems in this area in kenya <e> <s> we have been making representations on that matter including in particular those made by my right honourable friend <e> <s> perhaps i could let the noble lord have the detail of some of the matters that have emerged and some of the very satisfactory responses we have observed in kenya since the issue of the amnesty international report not least as i said earlier the response of president moi on the occasion to which i referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not without sympathy for the point that the right reverend prelate makes but i would if i may counsel a little caution <e>", "<cs> my lords on the noble lords last point we have made our views known that any such action would not meet with our approval <e> <s> i certainly have not heard of any such action having been taken <e> <s> i am aware of at least one political prisoner who has been released recently and i hope that more will be in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly think that amnesty international does a great deal of very useful and worthwhile work <e> <s> but whether it would be of benefit to make the public representations to which the noble lord is referring i am not quite so sure <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe my noble friend is aware of the progress to which i referred <e> <s> there has been a development with regard to the appeal court in france which has indicated that liability does indeed lie with the french personnel involved <e> <s> that being so i can only hope now for a satisfactory outcome as i said in the original answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree that it has been a long and sad case <e> <s> that is why it has attracted so much ministerial attention <e> <s> indeed it was rather more than two years ago that my right honourable friend the then minister of foreign affairs and i called the french ambassador to discuss the matter <e> <s> since then it has been taken forward with ministerial support <e>", "<cs> my lords the delay to which my noble friend refers has been the result of the workings of the french legal system <e> <s> our own legal system is sometimes not above criticism as regards the time which is taken to reach conclusions <e> <s> therefore i am not sure that it would be entirely appropriate for me to criticise another countrys legal system <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in the earlier answer i believe that we have the facilities in place for the purposes which the noble lord has rightly described <e> <s> perhaps the most important are those at the three main service hospitals in the united kingdom <e> <s> they are the royal naval hospital at haslar the royal air force hospital at wroughton and the army hospital at woolwich <e> <s> there are also units in hong kong and germany <e> <s> all those hospitals have an appropriate range of staff to deal with these problems <e> <s> there are also other arrangements relating to the more informal purposes to which the noble lord referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can claim that there was no question of any <e>", "<cs> my lords we conducted a major study into these matters two or three years ago with particular reference to the possibility of drug abuse in the armed forces <e> <s> following that study a range of new educational facilities have been put in place including lectures to those going abroad on exercise to countries where this may be a problem the issue of leaflets and posters and other forms of personal education <e>", "<cs> my lords that only goes to show that there are two sides to any question <e>", "<cs> my lords the <e>", "<cs> my lords questions are answered from this dispatch box by government spokesmen <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not remember the statement to which the noble lord is referring <e> <s> however the fact is that the number of holidays being taken abroad by british residents is steadily increasing <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness will be aware that aspect has been a matter for concern for a number of years <e> <s> however i am also aware that a number of arrangements have been put in place over the same period <e> <s> i do not believe that the difficulties have entirely disappeared <e> <s> however the situation is better than it once was <e>", "<cs> my lords the figure was for the number of holidays trips abroad <e> <s> the total number of visits abroad was <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not have the figures country by country <e> <s> however i can tell the noble lord that out of the total figure of to which i referred in answer to the supplementary question of the noble lord lord wigoder million people were holiday-makers were business travellers people were visiting friends and relatives and visits were miscellaneous <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords the question on the order paper asks whether we have imported any uranium which originated in namibia since <e> <s> the answer that i gave the noble lord was the correct one <e> <s> as a matter of fact we have never imported any uranium originating from namibia because it is uranium ore that we import and not the metal itself <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will forgive me for saying so it really is not very satisfactory for him to place a question on the order paper receive an answer and then complain that he has not had the answer to some different question <e> <s> the question that i answered was the question that <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly not recently <e>", "<cs> my lords that is because recently we have not needed any <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that decree number one of the united nations council for namibia was made outside the competence of the general assembly which set up that particular council <e> <s> therefore we regard it as null and void <e>", "<cs> my lords i always try to answer the questions which are either on the order paper or are put to me subsequently not the ones which might unexpectedly have been in the minds of noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness will agree the government are very much addicted to sweeping away useless regulations <e> <s> however i certainly accept that in this case we would wish to do so only after careful consultation and careful consideration following that consultation <e> <s> on the timing the noble baroness will be aware that we are under some constraints because of the requirement in one of the proposals that relates to the ilo convention <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that we would very much like to see a stable government established in afghanistan at the time of the welcome withdrawal of soviet troops <e> <s> however it is equally important that that government should be one which the people of afghanistan have chosen for themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords there are many discussions taking place as i am sure the noble lord will be aware <e> <s> while the announcement of withdrawal by the soviet union is welcome as i have said we must remember that the soviet union created this problem <e> <s> it was soviet union troops who arrived unannounced and uninvited in afghanistan <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that there have been a number of exchanges between the relevant governments including the united kingdom government on this matter <e> <s> as for finding a way for the future we think that it would be highly desirable to have a stable government in place at the time of the soviet withdrawal <e> <s> however as i said earlier that must be a government which commands the respect and has the acceptance of the afghan people <e> <s> one must be careful not to place unnecessary roadblocks in the way of a soviet withdrawal which we regard as the first priority <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord makes a serious point if i may say so <e> <s> it is certainly the case that soviet union troops arrived in afghanistan uninvited and unrequired in a way which commanded the condemnation of the entire world <e> <s> it is therefore now the soviet unions responsibility to facilitate the withdrawal of its troops if i may put it that way <e> <s> we have to be careful in the current climate of thinking that everything has changed in the soviet union <e> <s> while some things have changed to a welcome extent certainly not everything has changed <e>", "<cs> my lords i look forward to the day when the people of afghanistan can settle their affairs free from intervention of any kind wherever it may come from <e> <s> since the soviet invasion of that country seven years ago the afghan people have been putting up what i consider to be a very brave <e>", "<cs> my lords as i recall it the alleged invitation to the soviet union was issued by a chap who turned out to have been killed two days previously <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have that number in front of me <e> <s> i am aware that about million afghans altogether are refugees of one kind or another from the hostility which has been vented on their country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that any withdrawals have yet commenced <e> <s> my noble friend says that this is a test of soviet integrity <e> <s> that integrity if that is what it was was shattered the day that they walked into afghanistan <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall certainly be looking for enhanced capabilities within the areas to which my noble friend has referred in whatever tank we decide upon as the chieftain replacement <e> <s> indeed we are already applying such enhancements to the existing challenger fleet and i hope that such improvements will be brought into service shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i do not know about that <e> <s> i and my ministerial colleagues are looking for the most cost-effective solution to the requirement to replace the chieftain tanks <e> <s> but naturally we shall take into account the implications of such a decision upon the british tank manufacturing industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it is correct to say that vickers are supplying a tank for the indian government <e> <s> as i understand the position india is manufacturing her own tank although i believe that vickers do have some part in supplying some of the sub-systems <e> <s> however we shall take into account and consider all sensible options that are available to us <e>", "<cs> my lords as i told my noble friend on the occasion to which he has referred a decision has not yet been taken <e> <s> that position remains the same but i expect that we shall be in a position to make such a decision some time later this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether that is a relevant question for today because the germans the french and ourselves are now all part of the nato alliance <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that what the noble lord has just said is a correct assessment of the situation <e> <s> if we decided upon a tank of different origin to the one which the noble lord referred to then i dare say it would be manufactured in this country under licence <e> <s> however that decision has not yet been taken <e>", "<cs> my lords we have no plans to arrange a multilateral meeting of the type envisaged by the noble lord <e> <s> we keep in close touch with allies with naval forces in the gulf and maintain contact with iran and iraq <e>", "<cs> my lords there has in fact been a reduction in the level of attacks on shipping in recent weeks which is of course a welcome sign <e> <s> however there has been an unfortunate escalation of the attacks between the two capital cities of iran and iraq a fact which we deplore <e> <s> a united nations security council resolution some months ago called for a cease-fire <e> <s> we believe that the right way forward is for both parties to recognise and implement that resolution <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards our naval presence in the gulf i expect the noble lord will be aware that we recently announced that there would be a reduction from four to three in the number of minesweepers that we have in the region <e> <s> we have no plans for any other significant changes in our naval presence in that area for the time being <e> <s> as for the implementation of the resolution calling for a ceasefire resolution we think that the time has come for a further resolution to secure the implementation of the earlier one <e> <s> we believe that such further resolution should be in the form of an arms embargo on iran <e>", "<cs> my lords for reasons that i am certain he can well understand we think it would be difficult to proceed in the way that my noble friend suggested <e> <s> we think that the best way forward lies in the implementation of the earlier security council resolution <e> <s> we wish to give all our support to the secretary general of the united nations in achieving that implementation <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that we are actively canvassing support for such <e>", "<cs> my lords we continue to see formidable practical difficulties in the way of any such idea under present circumstances <e> <s> there are not only the problems in relation to the rules of engagement and operational instructions to which i referred on an earlier occasion but there are also those of actually obtaining the agreement of the security council for such an implementation and for example equitable costs and burden sharing <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is right to point to the difficulties of having a sensible conversation with people of influence in iran <e> <s> but i hope that in due course they will see the force of international opinion which is behind the implementation of the united nations resolution in this matter and will enter into proper conversations for example with the united nations secretary general <e>", "<cs> my lords that is what i have been trying to say <e> <s> we now think it right that the united nations security council should move to a further resolution imposing an arms embargo <e> <s> we are supporting moves to that end <e> <s> we hope that the soviet union which of course plays a major part in this consideration will also reach that conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am greatly obliged to both the noble lords and the noble baroness for their interventions and for their unanimous welcome to the measure which i venture to bring before your lordships house tonight <e> <s> having been squeezed out <e>", "<cs> my lords no it is not <e> <s> the appearance of dr orman at the conference does not symbolise any such thing <e>", "<cs> my lords the sdi programme is a research programme to investigate the feasibility of some of the concepts which have been proposed it is no more than that <e> <s> as regards the value of contracts so far won by british organisations they amount to some million dollars spread over some contracts <e> <s> as i understand it there are one or two significant contracts to be announced in the not too distant future <e>", "<cs> my lords we maintain tight restrictions on the export of military equipment to israel because of the residual israeli presence in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether i followed the implications of the noble lords question with regard to the british government <e> <s> however our views on what is happening in that part of the world have been made very clear <e>", "<cs> i am very much obliged to the noble lord lord wedderburn for his considered intervention with regard to the amendment and indeed to other noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> the noble lord lord wedderburn is a considerable practitioner in this area but i fear that it sometimes is the case that experienced practitioners i dare say that i have done this myself in those few areas where i have any expertise at all have fallen into the trap of failing to see the wood for the trees <e> <s> the basic thrust of what is proposed in the bill amended as i now suggest by what is before your lordships is that there should be no industrial action without a ballot <e> <s> that is to say that trade unions who seek to persuade their members to take industrial action of whatever kind should first ascertain their views <e> <s> the corollary if i am to believe noble lords opposite is that there may be occasions when trade unions would like to induce their members to take industrial action maybe against their views or certainly without ascertaining their views and that that is desirable <e> <s> i do not agree <e>", "<cs> the noble lord answered that question in the first sentence that he uttered <e> <s> the bill relates to the actions of trade unions not to the actions of individuals <e> <s> in respect of this amendment the basic proposition that i bring before the committee is that no one should be induced by his union to take industrial action unless his views have first been determined <e> <s> i believe that to be a wholly unobjectionable proposition <e> <s> i invite the committees agreement to it <e>", "<cs> i repeat that the proposition is that no member of a trade union should be invited or induced to take industrial action unless his views have first been determined <e> <s> i do not believe that the noble lords question arises from that simple proposition <e> <s> i again invite the committees agreement to my amendment <e>", "<cs> very likely they may be <e> <s> i hope that during the course of my few remarks i can persuade the committee in particular the noble lord lord wedderburn that the amendment is unnecessary and would add nothing of substance to the effect of the clause <e>", "<cs> we discussed this matter at considerable length in relation to amendment no <e> <s> a few minutes ago <e> <s> therefore i do not wish to labour the point <e> <s> of course the noble lord is entitled to return to the subject in the guise of another amendment should he think fit <e>", "<cs> i believe that it needs the consent of the committee to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> i believe that the correct procedure is i am sure that i shall be corrected if i am wrong that if the committee has not agreed to the withdrawal of the amendment the question should be that the amendment be agreed to <e>", "<cs> i think it goes without saying that industrial action however you define it is designed to cause damage to the employer <e> <s> the noble lord referred to it as inconvenience to the employer but whether or not it represents a technical breach of the contract of employment of the employee very often it brings serious damage to the employer <e> <s> sometimes that damage is so serious that the very livelihood of the employees is at stake <e> <s> the whole future of the firm is called into question <e>", "<cs> i must confess that when first saw the noble lords amendment i was somewhat puzzled about exactly what it meant <e> <s> to be perfectly honest i am not very much clearer now having listened to the noble lord <e> <s> the problem is mine however and not his <e> <s> therefore if the noble lord will give me an opportunity to study what he has said i shall undertake that the matter will be looked into in case there is a problem of the kind that he has identified <e> <s> at first blush i do not think that there is but i may be wrong <e> <s> i should like an opportunity to look into the matter further and on that basis i invite the noble lord to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall start by dealing with the specific amendment before us and then perhaps saying a few words rather more widely about the clause itself because i fancy that the committee having had such a full debate on this amendment will not wish to dilate at such length when we reach clause stand part <e> <s> however that is not to prevent members of the committee from intervening when they think if right to do so but members may agree to proceed in that way <e>", "<cs> no i have been careful to choose cases which are relevant and which might cause continuing problems had we not brought forward the proposition contained in this clause <e> <s> i give your lordships another example <e>", "<cs> that is what the members thought <e> <s> unfortunately they were fined and then excluded from overtime at the cost of another <e>", "<cs> we debated the principle of the proposition behind the noble lords amendment at length before dinner and your lordships reached a conclusion on it <e> <s> i do not wish to weary your lordships unduly by repeating all the arguments that i put forward then <e> <s> nor would i wish to draw further on the great reservoir of cases that i have in my brief explaining the background as to how the government came to this view <e> <s> the great reservoir of cases of abuse of their position which the trade unions have i fear to some extent <e>", "<cs> i think i should unduly detain your lordships by dilating on that <e> <s> however i shall be very happy perhaps at the next stage when no doubt the noble lord will table more amendments to deploy one or two more of these black examples for the noble lords delectation <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say again that i do not intend to run through all the arguments which we deployed before dinner on the general issue <e> <s> however i shall address the amendment moved by the noble lord <e> <s> frankly the logic of the amendment is rather clearer than that of some of the earlier ones but i am afraid still cannot agree with it <e>", "<cs> i was sorry to hear just now from the noble lord lord wedderburn that his spirits were beginning to flag because of these matters particularly in the context of this amendment <e> <s> as he rightly pointed out during the proceedings in another place the government made a significant concession and the clause as presently drafted represents that concession <e>", "<cs> i fear that i have no comfort to offer the noble lord <e> <s> he has referred at length to the pressures that may be brought to bear on the families of trade union officials who had been wrongly criticised by a member <e> <s> if we talk about pressures being brought to bear on people in the past few years we seem to have heard a great many stories of pressures not being brought to bear upon the officials of trade unions but brought by officials upon their members particularly in some of the more bitter disputes that we have had in recent times <e>", "<cs> all that the trade union official has to do is to show that what the member is alleging is false <e> <s> his position is then quite protected <e>", "<cs> as i dare say is now clear the government believe that union members should not be disciplined at all for working during a strike or other industrial action or for seeking to enforce their legal rights <e> <s> we recognise that unions cannot in the end be forced to keep individuals in membership any more than employers can be forced to continue employing someone <e> <s> the clause reflects these principles <e> <s> it provides the individual with a right to compensation if expulsion occurs analogous to a dismissed employees right to compensation in a parallel situation <e>", "<cs> i apologise indeed he did mention it <e> <s> i am aware that the tuc has complained that this provision may breach the convention <e> <s> the government are quite convinced that that is not so <e> <s> we believe that the provision is entirely within our international obligations including the convention to which the noble lord refers <e>", "<cs> i undertook to examine a similar matter in connection with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am happy to give the same assurance in connection with amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i do not have much to add to the discussion <e> <s> at the end of the remarks that i made before the dinner break i said that the proposition was contained in the green paper published last year <e> <s> it was also contained in the conservative party manifesto at the last election and was approved by the electorate <e> <s> it was approved by another place when it considered the provisions of the bill <e> <s> it was also approved by your lordships house in the division before the dinner break and that was aimed at the principle of this bill <e> <s> i do not believe that the proposition could have better credentials and i recommend to the committee that the clause remains part of the bill <e>", "<cs> i believe that the bill as drafted does exactly what the noble baroness wishes because as it is drafted tribunals and the eat will be able to have regard to loss suffered by the applicant when deciding whatever amount is <e>", "<cs> i apologise <e> <s> i should have been rather more forthcoming on the second point because the noble baroness is also seeking the removal of the minimum award <e> <s> the minimum award reflects the seriousness of cases where the penalty has not been revoked <e> <s> unions will therefore have an incentive to rescind displinary action before individuals apply to the employment appeal tribunal if they know they will otherwise be liable to pay at least a minimum award <e> <s> this liability cannot of course arise until at least four weeks after declaration of unjustifiable discipline has been made by an industrial tribunal <e> <s> it is important to keep the minimum award provision in place because as i have said that gives the union an incentive to rescind the action before the eat machinery creaks into action <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord dundee will reply to the amendment in a few moments but i wonder whether i may be allowed to intervene briefly on one point <e> <s> the noble lord has spoken on many occasions about the great reservoir of cases to which i have referred <e> <s> i did not say that i would reveal that reservoir to noble lords <e> <s> i undertook to write to the noble lord lord wedderburn about the international implications and that i shall do but the reservoir is for occasional revelation in small parts <e>", "<cs> that is correct <e>", "<cs> i believe that good things come in small packages <e> <s> i shall allow the noble lord the occasional look as we go through the bill <e>", "<cs> i described two of the cases during discussions on an earlier amendment <e> <s> other members of the committee were as disturbed by those cases as i was <e> <s> it would not be right to reveal a whole raft of cases now <e> <s> i do not intend to do that <e>", "<cs> this clause is concerned with the rights of an employee in respect of deductions from his pay made by his employer <e> <s> it does not affect his substantive obligations to the union for example to pay subscriptions so long as he remains a member <e> <s> the need for the clause arises from the quite unreasonable difficulties that have sometimes been <e>", "<cs> if i may say so this amendment is the closed shop having a last rigor mortis wriggle if that is the right word a last struggle before it finally sinks into the world of oblivion where it rightly belongs <e> <s> in any event the amendment is defective because taken at face value it seeks to retain the whole panopoly of closed shop approval and dismissal for non-union membership for certain employers and accepts its repeal in the case of others <e> <s> the distinction would be determined by the employers expressed intention to engage members of specified trade unions <e> <s> i need hardly say that such a proposal would be quite unacceptable to the government <e>", "<cs> the government have made clear that clause is intended to ensure that union leaders are representative of the membership <e> <s> it therefore extends the trade union acts election requirements to all members of the principal executive committee general secretaries and presidents and to those who have the right under the rules or by custom and practice to attend and speak at some or all meetings of the pec other than in a genuinely advisory capacity <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord is asking me to look into the mind of mr scargill and to explain why <e>", "<cs> special register bodies have been part of the industrial relations scheme since the early s <e> <s> they are primarily professional associations with incorporated status which also conduct negotiations with employers about terms and conditions of employment <e> <s> as the noble lord lord wedderburn has already made clear the bma and the royal college of nursing are two of the better known examples <e> <s> in essence they have evolved from their original status as professional bodies and now have a dual role as professional bodies and independent trade unions <e> <s> they are also bodies corporate <e> <s> this dual role puts them in a unique position in legislation and legislation has long made a distinction between them and other unions <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord does that i hope he will pause to reflect for a moment that the reason why we have agreed to perpetuate the special arrangements for these organisations is that we have given them an undertaking that we shall do that <e> <s> the noble lord is perfectly entitled to abrogate the undertakings given by the government of which he was not a member but certainly a supporter some years ago <e> <s> i prefer to stand by the undertakings given by my right honourable and honourable friends <e> <s> that is the reason why i oppose the amendment <e>", "<cs> i confined my remarks to the amendment and was careful not to stray on to topics in other amendments <e> <s> despite that perhaps i should have said that the amendment paves the way for amendments nos <e> <s> and which i hope i shall be able to move formally <e>", "<cs> if i may speak slightly off the cuff in reply to the noble lord a president an honorary president or an honorary general secretary who is not involved in the decision-making process of the union <e>", "<cs> as i understand it if he holds office for more than a year he is not covered by the benefits of the amendment which is specifically directed at those who hold office for a year <e> <s> the subsection provides for a period of months so that individuals can hold their positions from one annual conference to another as annual conferences do not always take place exactly one year apart <e> <s> if there is a biennial conference i fear that the person who wanted to hold office between the two conferences would not enjoy the benefits of the amendment <e>", "<cs> the basis is that this is a response to a request from the opposition in the other place who were apparently anxious to receive the concession <e> <s> they would of course have preferred the concession to go wider but we felt unable to agree to that <e> <s> we have moved in the direction of the opposition and i hope that that at least will be recognised <e>", "<cs> i do not intend to reply immediately to the noble baroness but the committee might find it convenient if we also discussed amendments nos <e> <s> and tabled by the noble viscount lord hanworth and amendment no <e> <s> tabled by my noble friend lord brentford <e>", "<cs> the word incidental appears in the amendment of the noble viscount lord hanworth amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i imagine it was that to which my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter was referring <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just finish this sentence tempted to stray beyond the professional advisory capacity will find themselves outside the ambit of the protection which we provide here <e>", "<cs> i am very reluctant to give a legal opinion on a particular hypothetical situation about which the noble baroness has given me just one sentence <e> <s> if i were a legal adviser advising a trade union i should not be content to give advice on the basis of instructions represented by one or two sentences <e> <s> i believe however that in the kind of situation that the noble baroness has indicated where the action that an executive committee had in mind was likely to be secondary action and therefore outlawed by a particular provision it could properly question a legal adviser on that matter <e> <s> i think that such an adviser asked just such a question would enjoy the protection of this clause <e>", "<cs> i believe that my noble friend is right to say that on occasions legal advice perhaps less categoric than the example given by the noble baroness is sometimes disregarded <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that on the right of me i have three most distinguished members of the legal profession who disagree among themselves <e> <s> i think that the right thing for me to do under these circumstances is to accept that there is room for more than one respectable view on this matter and to undertake to have it examined further between now and the next stage <e> <s> i do so without commitment because i am not necessarily persuaded by one view or the other <e> <s> but i shall ask for the matter to be considered by a further range of experts if i may put it that way and if i think fit bring forward a further amendment at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i agree that the amendment is something of a trojan horse <e> <s> for that reason i find it impossible to agree to it <e> <s> the amendment would add a new subsection with the effect that with the exception of general secretaries and presidents individuals would not be members of the pec and therefore not subject to the election requirement if the rules of their union stated that they or people occupying their positions were not principal executive committee members and had no right to vote at meetings of the pec <e> <s> that would leave all non-members free to act as if they were pec members other than voting without being required to be elected <e> <s> that is a trojan horse if ever i saw one <e> <s> i cannot accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to start by saying that i am grateful to the noble lord lord wyatt for the further explanation that he gave of the reasons behind his amendment <e> <s> he gave us a foretaste of what he had in mind during the course of our debate at second reading <e> <s> i shall address the substance of his comments in a moment <e> <s> first of all however i should perhaps point out that i do not think that his proposed amendments would achieve the intended result <e>", "<cs> i understand the feeling that the noble lord has expressed on this matter <e> <s> i shall certainly ensure that further consideration is given to this point <e> <s> frankly i cannot hold out much hope that we shall reach any different conclusion but if the noble lord would like to continue his discussion with my honourable or right honourable friends on this matter i am certain that they would be more than happy to do so <e>", "<cs> there can be no serious argument against the principle of clause that all those who bear the responsibility for the running of a union should submit themselves for regular election in a proper ballot <e>", "<cs> when i saw those words i feared that the noble lord might rise to his feet in response to them and he has <e> <s> given the number of people involved which is not enormous it is fairly easy to ascertain how old particular people are and therefore to form a view on the broad effect of such a provision on the range of people involved <e>", "<cs> as i understand it yes <e>", "<cs> given the appointments that we are considering the retirement age is generally spelt out specifically regardless of whether it is a man or a woman <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can reflect upon that request <e> <s> off the cuff i cannot think of any reason why we should not <e>", "<cs> no the noble lord oversimplifies the process by which the government arrive at these legislative proposals <e>", "<cs> i hope the noble lord will allow me to intervene <e> <s> there is another side to this matter <e> <s> the noble lord says that it is not fair upon the official concerned to have to subject himself to an election <e> <s> however he is also saying that it is therefore fair for the thousands perhaps hundreds of thousands of members of trade unions to continue to have the services of a senior official who may or may not reflect their views or wishes for a period of perhaps two or three years <e> <s> the government therefore have to tread a rather careful path between the two <e>", "<cs> i said relatively aged <e>", "<cs> generally by looking at their faces <e>", "<cs> the known facts are largely published already because there are many books of reference in which the names of distinguished general secretaries appear and most of them put in their age <e> <s> i daresay that their ages are accurately entered although equally i daresay that lady general secretaries often decline to do that and quite right too <e>", "<cs> i agree and the government agree that these people are not to be abandoned in the way that the noble lord is perhaps suggesting <e> <s> there are transitional provisions in the act which apply equally to the cases that we are referring to under the bill <e> <s> therefore i hope the noble lord will accept that while the transitional provisions are perhaps not as extensive or as generous as some would wish equally they go further than others would wish <e> <s> the government have to take a median path between the two positions and i hope the noble lord will agree that we have taken the right one <e>", "<cs> my noble friend will forgive me if i do not follow him down that particular road <e> <s> however perhaps i could echo the words of my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter when he said that this was a very important part of this bill and one which lies at the heart of government policy in this area <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord lord mccarthy for not making a longer speech <e> <s> i had no idea that he was opposed to this provision <e> <s> i had erroneously understood that the views of his <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord and to the committee if originally i moved this amendment less than adequately <e> <s> i have in front of me one two three four five pages of notes <e> <s> the committee is welcome to all five if it so wishes <e> <s> i believe that on balance the committee preferred the rather shorter opening that i offered given that this amendment has attracted wide support if not from the noble lord lord mccarthy <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend will permit me the noble lord lord wyatt has put a question to my noble friend and perhaps he would like to reply to it <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord would allow me to intervene <e> <s> is he making the case for his amendment by quoting the minister in another place or is he about to make a case which we can understand <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that the noble lord misunderstood me <e> <s> what i was puzzled about was the noble lord moving his amendment and then quoting at length the speeches given in the committee stage in another place which actually rebutted some similar amendments at that time <e> <s> if the noble lord will give me the opportunity i shall be able to do the same now <e>", "<cs> we shall not do that i am afraid <e> <s> the aim of clause is to prevent the situation where a union wishing to ensure that a certain group of workers at one place of work are included in a strike includes with them in the balloting constituency on an <e>", "<cs> i think that i can help the noble lord <e> <s> where a balloting or voting constituency covers a number of employers a separate balloting requirement would apply only if the criteria of subsection b to which i referred failed to be satisfied in respect of one or more of those voting <e> <s> the main criterion is the common distinguishing factor which is to be tested against other employees of the same employer <e> <s> to test it against employees of other employers would be more burdensome for the union <e> <s> that is the sole function of the reference to the same employer <e> <s> i hope that that answers the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> if i may say so i think that the difficulty is in the mind of the noble lord <e> <s> i do not see the difficulty that the noble lord describes <e> <s> perhaps i may continue with what i have to say and in so doing i may be able to help the noble lord further <e>", "<cs> i am not willing to agree that we should amend the bill as i think the noble lord is asking because i do not believe that it would be appropriate or necessary <e> <s> it is important for the bill to spell out in proper legal terms exactly what is wanted and required <e> <s> however there may be some scope for providing some guidance to employers organisations for example and if that is what the noble lord has in mind i shall certainly be willing to consider it <e>", "<cs> frankly if i were to accept every proposition advanced by the noble lord lord wedderburn that a particular proposal was not clear i think i would find that there was very little left to any of the trade union and other legislation that we bring before the chamber <e> <s> while the noble lord is indeed an acknowledged expert in these matters he is also the principal opposition spokesman on these issues and the duty of the opposition is to oppose however meritorious are the proposals that we bring forward <e>", "<cs> i repeat that it is necessary for the legislation to spell out the proposition in proper legal terms <e> <s> i have accepted the point made by the noble lord lord rochester that there may be a case for guidance to employers federations <e> <s> i have undertaken to look at that matter and i think that that specifically meets the point which the noble lord lord rochester made <e>", "<cs> i explained to the committee the aim of clause and the way in which it will operate in relation to the previous amendment <e> <s> it is worth repeating the effect of subsection bb <e> <s> i repeat that the union will not be required to hold separate place of work ballots if all the members of the union accorded entitlement to vote who are employed by the same employer have factors in common which relate to their terms or conditions of employment or occupational description and are not factors common to any other member employed by the same employer who is not accorded entitlement to vote and only where other members of the union employed by the same employers not in the balloting constituency is not a factor which employees of that employer have in common because of their place or places of work <e> <s> i am sorry if that is not clear to members of the committee opposite but it is reasonably clear to me even with my inexperience and ignorance of these matters to which the noble baroness lady seear referred <e>", "<cs> i am sure that i am wholly out of order in rising to speak at this moment but of course the noble lord is entitled to table what amendments he thinks fit at report stage provided that they do not deal with a matter on which the chamber has already reached a decision <e> <s> if therefore the noble lord decides not to move his amendments tonight he will be perfectly at liberty to table them at the report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the remarks of my noble friend <e> <s> i certainly agree that boots are a very important part of a soldiers equipment <e> <s> i am glad that we have eventually been able to find a boot that i think will meet the high requirements <e> <s> i should say that we still need to conduct an intensive trial with the new design of boot that we have decided upon <e> <s> i hope that that trial will be successful and that in due course we shall be able to issue these boots to the armed forces <e>", "<cs> my lords it was found particularly during the falklands campaign that the existing design of boot had some shortcomings and that is why we have decided upon a new one <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall be advertising our requirements as widely as possible but i am pretty certain that british manufacturers will be well to the fore in the bids that we receive <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right that is an important consideration <e> <s> what is difficult to achieve is a boot that while keeping the water out will also allow the foot to breathe <e> <s> that is why something like a wellington boot is not suitable particularly when worn over a long period <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has pointed to a curious but nonetheless accurate feature of collaboration in this particular matter <e> <s> every soldier prefers the boot that he has not got and at the same time seems to prefer the rations of other armies too <e>", "<cs> my lords i make no apology for the considerable increase in the defence budget that has occurred under this administration <e> <s> it is a pity that we did not get the same increase under the previous one <e>", "<cs> my lords that is indeed one of the problems that we have had to face and why as i said just now a sealed-up boot of one kind or another is really not suitable for this purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that that question wholly arises from the one on the order paper but i agree that when soldiers go into combat it is important that they concentrate upon the task in hand <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale for his intervention to which i believe the committee will wish to attach considerable importance <e> <s> the noble and learned lord was supported by my almost equally learned friend sitting on my right which adds a special force to what the noble and learned lord said <e>", "<cs> perhaps not every amendment but a great many tabled by the opposition enjoy the support of the noble baroness <e> <s> indeed during earlier discussions on this bill the noble baroness spoke in support of opposition amendments to which she had not specifically attached her name but with which she nonetheless found herself in agreement <e> <s> whether this comparatively new departure by the liberal party totally aligning itself with the views of

decides the secretary of state might become one of a different political persuasion <e> <s> that is how the system works <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that parliament often provides powers to the secretary of state <e> <s> naturally the bill now before the committee has been drafted by the government with a view to its provisions being implemented by this secretary of state and his conservative successors <e> <s> i dare say and hope that that will continue for a long time <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> i was hoping to intervene when most members of the committee had expressed their views so that i could perhaps respond to all of them at the same time <e>", "<cs> i fully appreciate the good intentions behind the amendment but i assure noble lords that the duty on the secretary of state under clause clearly includes a requirement to make provision for the disabled <e> <s> this provision also allows him to make special arrangements for this group of people to take account of their particular needs and problems <e>", "<cs> i was in fact just saying that that particular amendment was inserted in the legislation by this chamber and as i understand it against the advice of the government on that occasion <e> <s> that is why i was able to say that i believe it was thought unnecessary at that time by the government <e>", "<cs> no i do not suppose that it has done any harm <e> <s> however if the noble lord will allow me to continue he may be reassured by what i have to say <e> <s> for the reasons that i have given <e> <s> i have already explained why i do not think that the amendment is necessary <e> <s> but having said that i understand that your lordships have strong views on the issue as was evidenced by the speeches made on the previous bill to which the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale referred <e> <s> in the circumstances i undertake to have another look at the wording of this passage to see whether it is possible to underline and clarify beyond peradventure the governments intentions in the matter <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble baroness is concerned that the opportunities offered to young people may not be suitable and that because of the time limits which are proposed on the payment of the yts bridging allowance young people may be coerced into accepting unsuitable places of perhaps dubious quality <e> <s> i cannot accept that proposition <e> <s> the extension of the child benefit period for three months for easter and christmas school leavers and four months for summer school leavers provides ample opportunity for young people to consider all the options available to themthe bridging allowance is available for nearly two months and this time should be more than adequate to match an individual with a suitable yts place <e> <s> i recognise that in some instances there may be special needs to take account of and that is why there will be no time limit imposed <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may start by mentioning the guarantee of a yts place to which the noble lord lord rochester referred in his opening remarks <e> <s> i believe that i can set aside the anxiety which was expressed about whether the msc will be able to meet its guarantee to provide a yts place for any or year-old who would otherwise be unemployed <e>", "<cs> the committee <e>", "<cs> i hope that in a very few words i can persuade the committee to agree that this clause should remain part of the bill <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that in recent months indeed in the past year or <e>", "<cs> i fully share the concern of the committee that benefit sanctions should not be applied to those who have good cause for refusing failing to accept or for leaving a place on an <e>", "<cs> i am always anxious to help <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the advice of the noble lord <e> <s> far from being the significant change to which noble lords opposite have referred <e> <s> clause simply rectifies an anomaly in section of the act by bringing the provisions on employment and <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the advice from the noble lord opposite and from my noble friend <e> <s> i have gone into the background of the essence of the provision and the amendment before the committee <e> <s> it is the question of the individual rights of trainees <e> <s> several noble lords have suggested that all trainees on our schemes should have the rights of employees and an employment contract <e> <s> it may help if i explain that many employers take on additional trainees surplus to their employee requirements <e> <s> for example that applies to yts trainees because they recognise their responsibility to train for the future of the country and not just for their own particular needs <e> <s> it would clearly be wrong to demand that these surplus trainees should have the same rights as employees but to insist that they should have even more extensive rights of appeal than their fellow employees would be very unfair and would place an intolerable burden on employers <e> <s> employers may choose not to take on trainees rather than to attempt to shoulder such a burden which would result in less help for unemployed people <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if i do not respond in the way that the noble lord hopes regarding the amendment <e> <s> the essence of the proposition contained in this clause is one that i have referred to and i do not believe i can help the noble lord further <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may help the noble lord further in this way <e> <s> i refer in particular to amendment no <e> <s> c because we are dealing with that and amendment no <e> <s> d in the same debate <e> <s> by requiring an appeal system prior to dismissal amendment no <e> <s> c seeks to give a right of appeal to trainees way beyond the rights of employees <e> <s> i suggest that this is quite impractical and unnecessary <e> <s> it would be a major departure from current industrial relations law and practice to require employers to follow an appeals mechanism before dismissing an employee <e> <s> the closest that current legislation comes to this is when an industrial tribunal makes an order for reinstatement in a case of unfair dismissal <e> <s> even then the law recognises that reinstatement is not always practicable and allows for compensation to be paid instead <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble lord lord mccarthy suggested that my answers have had a certain sameness about them regarding the amendments we have dealt with this afternoon <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that some of the amendments have had a certain sameness about them <e> <s> naturally i have tried to confine my replies to the essence of the <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if the noble lord lord irvine thinks that that is unsatisfactory unacceptable or inadequate <e> <s> it is fair for me to say that such machinery exists and for the reasons i have described we do not think it would be appropriate to supply the alternate route which is suggested by noble lords opposite <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend lord renton for making the point or at least one of the points that i intended to make to your lordships in response to the amendment <e> <s> it is proposed in the amendment that the young person should indeed be entitled to turn down without good cause three opportunities of a training place that may be offered to him <e> <s> furthermore it is proposed that he should at the same time continue to enjoy the benefits that he was receiving <e> <s> i do not think that that is a sensible or fair proposition <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is again quite right in what he says <e> <s> indeed as i said during the discussion on an earlier amendment many thousands of additional courses will be made available this year and next year <e> <s> this will ensure that there are an adequate number of places available for those who may need them and also that there is an adequate range of choice of such courses so that those who advise the young people can select the best and most appropriate course for the young person in question <e>", "<cs> yes a high-level course <e> <s> equally i dare say there will not be a great range of applicants suitably qualified for such a course <e> <s> it will not be possible to offer many such desirable courses to young people but there will be a considerable range of desirable courses tailored to the needs of the young people involved <e> <s> my noble friend lord renton is right when he says that it is not satisfactory that applicants should be able to turn down three offers of a course without good cause <e>", "<cs> when i held a different appointment in the ministry of defence i was responsible for the armed forces yts <e> <s> there were a number of desirable excellent courses and we were short of suitable applicants for them <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord understands we are talking about year-olds <e> <s> the proposition contained in the amendment is that they should be allowed without good cause to reject the offer of up to three courses <e> <s> i do not think that is a sensible proposition <e> <s> it is the proposition enshrined in the amendment <e> <s> i do not think that the committee should agree to it <e>", "<cs> it is not necessary to write in refusal of a course with good cause because that is already inherent in the provision <e>", "<cs> i daresay some of the bolshie ones come from public schools as well <e> <s> be that as it may as i have already explained the provisions of section of the social security act as amended by clause already allow an individual to leave or turn down a place if he has good cause or if the training place offered is not a reasonable opportunity <e> <s> if an approved training course would not help an individual get back into work or it was not suitable in his case either because of his capacities aptitudes or domestic circumstances then that individual could refuse a place on it either because he had good cause to do so or because the training place was not a suitable opportunity for him <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the amendments seek first to make it impossible for someone who is studying for a recognised qualification to be denied unemployment benefit if he refuses a course of approved training secondly to stipulate that all courses of approved training shall lead to a recognised qualification and thirdly to require recognised qualifications to be prescribed by order of the secretary of state after approval by both houses of parliament <e> <s> i shall try to deal with each of those matters in turn <e>", "<cs> i edited slightly the reply that i gave in the interests of brevity at this late hour <e> <s> i could offer more information about the vocational qualifications <e> <s> perhaps i may write to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> i had thought that it might be appropriate to continue as far as the end of clause <e> <s> as always i am in the hands of the committee <e>", "<cs> i apologise if the usual channels have not operated with their normal efficiency <e>", "<cs> order <e> <s> i have not moved that the house he resumed and that we adjourn <e> <s> however i am very happy to do so if that is the wish of the house <e> <s> i also suggest that we continue discussion of the employment bill at pm <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> as i have already stressed it has been a principle of benefit legislation since that to receive unemployment benefit one must be available for work <e> <s> however i am sure we are all in agreement that it is right that some people should not have to be available for work in order to receive income support <e> <s> most of the categories presented in this amendment are unnecessary as the people concerned would not be required to be available for work in the first place to claim income support <e> <s> in such cases benefit sanctions are not of course appropriate <e> <s> categories iv to ix in the amendment fall into this item <e>", "<cs> following the transfer of the jobcentre network from the manpower services commission to the new employment service an amendment was necessary to section of the social security act <e> <s> in amending section to make it clear that staff of the department of employment as well as staff of the msc may notify vacancies to jobseekers we have also taken this opportunity to rectify an existing anomaly in the benefit sanctions <e> <s> we are closing the loophole which allows a trainee on an approved scheme dismissed from his or her place for misconduct to receive unemployment benefit in full while an employee dismissed for the same reason would have benefit disqualified or reduced for weeks <e>", "<cs> i absolutely reject the proposition which lies at the heart of the intervention by the noble baroness <e> <s> what this clause is seeking to do is simply to enshrine a legislative feature which has been on our statute book for at least to years <e> <s> i do not believe that the noble baroness is entitled to make the accusation on the basis of these provisions <e>", "<cs> the committee will no doubt begin to tire of me saying that there is no need for the amendment <e> <s> i am afraid i have to repeat that observation as regards this amendment <e> <s> but the noble lord is not concerned about that i think <e> <s> the fact is that serious consideration is currently being given to the possibility of introducing just the sort of scheme that the noble lord has described <e> <s> i am afraid i cannot go any further than that at the present time but i hope that the noble lord will therefore accept that what he proposes is being given very serious consideration <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is entirely in order <e> <s> i believe the lord chairman will now put the question that clause stand part of the bill and the noble lord can make his speech <e>", "<cs> i could elaborate at length upon the benefits to employment which will flow from the bill and indeed all the previous acts which have been passed having similar titles but i would weary the committee unduly if i did that <e>", "<cs> i hope that i can very quickly help the noble lord on this matter <e> <s> the government have considerable sympathy with this proposal <e> <s> we have not yet been able to reach a final conclusion on the matter <e> <s> if the noble lord is prepared to withdraw this amendment and not move his subsequent one i shall undertake that that consideration shall be speeded up to the maximum extent possible with a view to reaching a conclusion before the next stage of the bill when it will be possible either for the government to table an amendment should it prove necessary or indeed for the noble lord to table one himself <e>", "<cs> i am proposing that the noble lord should withdraw this amendment and not move his next one <e>", "<cs> generally by looking at their faces <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that my opening remarks did not sufficiently explain to the noble lord the purposes of the amendment <e> <s> we discussed this issue at great length during an earlier stage of the bill and i thought that the committee would prefer a shorter rendition of those arguments in relation to this amendment <e>", "<cs> this is an issue which we discussed at considerable length in response to the amendments of the noble lord lord wyatt a few days ago <e> <s> perhaps i may consider what the noble lord has said <e> <s> if i have anything to add perhaps i may write to him <e>", "<cs> i have just explained that to the noble lord in response to an earlier point <e>", "<cs> at an earlier stage of this bill the responsibility for raising individual cases rested not with the government but with certain other members of this chamber <e> <s> i wish to make it quite clear that this bill is not drafted in a way that is aimed at some specific individual it is aimed at a class of persons described in the amendment clarified in particular by paragraph b to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> there is no question of this bill being aimed at a particular person <e> <s> it is aimed at the categories of persons described in the amendment which we believe will form a relevant and important part of the bill <e> <s> i am not in a position to expand further upon the description given in the amendment which i believe is clear beyond peradventure <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble lord is mistaken <e> <s> no contract of the kind described by the noble lord was entered into in <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that the united nations decree no <e> <s> to which the noble lord referred was passed outside the competence of the united nations general assembly and is therefore not binding <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right but the question on the order paper relates to uranium being imported for defence purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords the right reverend prelate will forgive me but that is another question <e> <s> as i indicated in my answer today and in earlier answers to the noble lord lord hatch and as indicated in answers that the noble lord has received from other speakers at this dispatch box it is a long time since we imported any uranium or uranium-related products from namibia <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked whether i was aware of the answers that have been given by my noble friend lord glenarthur <e> <s> the answer is yes because i helped draft them <e>", "<cs> my lords before ratifying the united nations convention against torture we need first to introduce domestic legislation which would deal with the provisions of the convention regarding extraterritorial jurisdiction and the definition of torture as including the causing of severe mental suffering <e> <s> we shall introduce this legislation as soon as we can <e>", "<cs> my lords we have as the noble and learned lord will be aware taken a leading role in the formulation of this convention <e> <s> we were among the first to sign it although as the noble and learned lord will know signing and ratification are separate steps <e> <s> we have signed the convention and we are determined to ratify it as soon as possible <e> <s> we shall do that as soon as we can make the necessary legislative provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be possible to do just as the noble baroness suggests <e> <s> i understand that some discussions are going on about that proposal at present <e> <s> if that proves possible naturally that will hasten the day when we can ratify the convention <e>", "<cs> my lords the legislative timetable is very tight as the noble lord will know <e> <s> there are many major bills going through parliament at present so i cannot be specific as to when the government can introduce the legislation <e> <s> however as i said a moment ago if it proves possible to effect this legislative change by amending the criminal justice bill the government will certainly be very pleased about that and it will hasten the day when we can ratify the convention <e>", "<cs> my lords i happen to think that all the government-sponsored legislation going through parliament at present in entirely beneficial <e> <s> i am certain that your lordships will agree with that in due course <e> <s> in the meantime we will do what we can to find a legislative occasion on which we can enact the necessary provisions for this convention and then we shall hasten to ratify it <e>", "<cs> my lords nobody doubts that it is a very important convention and one which we ought to ratify just as soon as we can <e> <s> however a change in our law is needed before we can effectively do that and that is as much a matter for parliament as it is for the government <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may start with amendment no <e> <s> and then move on to the other amendments <e> <s> i believe that amendment no <e> <s> would subvert the basic intention behind the clause that a member should have the right to restrain his union from inducing members including himself to take any industrial action without majority support for the action from a proper secret ballot <e>", "<cs> my lords as the house will recognise this amendment is similar to ones which were discussed in committee and on which your lordships reached a clear view following a division <e> <s> i note that it contains some new elements like the warning on the ballot paper but your lordships will not be surprised to hear that it is still unacceptable to the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i intend to answer the amendment on the marshalled list <e> <s> we have had a very full discussion on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords that if i may say so is an entirely different situation and not the one which is addressed by the clause or the amendment <e> <s> the government have made it very clear that we see the clause as fundamental to this part of the bill <e> <s> noble lords had a full debate on the matter in committee and i believe reached a clear conclusion on that occasion <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will on reflection consider that that conclusion was the right one and that the amendment is to be resisted <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may with the permission of the house ask him whether he realises that what he was attributing to me was not the speech that i delivered this afternoon it must have been another one in his own imagination <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend is asking me to consider whether those whose advice is habitually rejected are nonetheless to be elected to their position <e> <s> i shall certainly reflect on that matter <e> <s> however i have some doubts as to whether we shall wish to put in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords if your lordships will permit me perhaps i can speak again on this matter <e> <s> perhaps i may ask for advice on that point <e> <s> i am not aware that there is anything sinister intended in the words to which the noble lord has referred <e> <s> if he has any specific cases in mind i shall certainly have them looked at <e>", "<cs> my lords i am greatly obliged to the noble lord for introducing his amendment in the detail that he did <e> <s> we are back on the ground covered by the government amendments nos <e> <s> and which were considered and accepted in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may be disappointed but perhaps not surprised to hear that we do not for one moment accept his proposition that the bill is in any way hybrid <e> <s> this was a charge to which he alluded during the committee stage in particular in relation to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> which we have considered this evening seeks to address the same point <e> <s> i note

speak again <e> <s> i am surprised that the noble lord claims he has brought the matter forward now so that it can be fully considered <e> <s> the way in which this matter should be considered would be for the noble lord to comply with standing orders and put this motion on the order paper <e> <s> he chose not to do that <e> <s> standing orders are perfectly plain on the matter i refer the noble lord to the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to disappoint the noble lord <e> <s> with the permission of the house i should like to point out that that does not mean that one can do so without notice <e> <s> i am something of an expert in this matter because i was very much involved in the considerations in the act to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> at that time i was sitting on the benches opposite <e> <s> we were also anxious to have that bill referred to the examiners and we could do so only by means of a motion placed upon the order paper <e> <s> i remember that most clearly because i also took the advice of the house officials at that time <e> <s> however <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has not been moving an amendment <e> <s> he has been moving a motion <e> <s> that is very different <e> <s> i remain of the view that the noble lord should have put the matter on the order paper if he wished to discuss it <e> <s> however the noble lord has chosen to bring the matter before your lordships at this moment <e> <s> i must tell your lordships that the government believe that there is no possibility of the bill being hybrid <e> <s> we have considered the matter most carefully and have taken even better advice than the noble lord opposite <e> <s> on that basis i hope that the house will now reject this absurd motion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his explanation because we were not altogether clear about what this amendment was intended to achieve <e> <s> as your lordships will recall <e>", "<cs> my lords it is possible that the amendment as drafted will have an opposite effect to that intended <e> <s> subsections bbii and iii must be taken together <e> <s> it is not clear how the amendment to paragraph bii affects the definition of employer in paragraph biii but it is likely that the same interpretation would apply to both <e> <s> the effect would be that a union would be required to <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i shall speak again <e> <s> i recognise that these are matters of high legal interpretation <e> <s> the government remain very much of the view that the interpretation that i have advanced is correct and that the difficulties which i see with the amendment exist <e> <s> indeed if the concern in the mind of the noble lord is the possibility of an employer sub-dividing his workforce by for example hiving off activities to associated employers then the easier he makes it by this provision for the union to satisfy the tests which give exemption from the separate balloting requirement <e> <s> if however the noble lord wishes me to consider further whether we have got the wording right i shall happily do that between now and the next stage but not with any commitment that we shall bring forward any change <e>", "<cs> my lords the formulation of the relevant subsection of clause creates a firm link between place of work for the purposes of the clause and the term premises <e> <s> the term premises is however left undefined as is also the case for example in section of the trade union and labour relations act in connection with the determination of a persons place of work in certain circumstances related to picketing <e>", "<cs> my lords the arrangements for the appointment to be made by the secretary of state are entirely consistent with the normal practice for making appointments to non-departmental public bodies <e> <s> the appointment can be expected to proceed in the usual way and to involve consultation between the secretary of state and his colleagues <e> <s> the public <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to look into the question raised by the noble lord <e> <s> perhaps i may write to him between now and the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> what issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always willing to ponder anything that the noble lord says <e> <s> i cannot say there is any likelihood that there will be a change in the governments position on the amendment but i am glad to hear that the noble lord welcomes the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that during the committee stage of the bill i undertook to look to see what we could do to put our intentions in the bill beyond peradventure <e> <s> i have examined both the amendments tabled by my noble friend lord renton <e> <s> unlike the noble baroness lady turner i prefer the first one amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> indeed i am prepared to accept amendment no <e> <s> as moved by my noble friend on the understanding that then he will not wish to move amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise with a sneaking sympathy for some of the observations that we have heard this evening in particular as a minister who in another incarnation presides over some million of expenditure each year <e> <s> i must however assure my noble friend lord renton that the obligation to have treasury approval for payments made under this provision is simply carried over from section of the employment and training act which clause amends as your lordships are aware <e> <s> it is absolutely standard to have treasury approval for departmental spending of any description <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is suggested that participants in government schemes should always fall within the scope of directive of the european community which is fully implemented in the united kingdom through the equal pay act <e> <s> the government certainly share the concern that the provisions of the equal pay act should be properly applied <e> <s> as your lordships are no doubt aware the provisions of the act apply only to those who are employed as defined by that act <e> <s> however i think it is suggested that trainees on our <e>", "<cs> my lords i think not because although there is no doubt scope for interpretation of definitions there is no scope for changing the fundamental thrust of the directives in question <e>", "<cs> my lords the provisions of section of the social security act as amended by clause already allow an individual to leave or to turn down a place if he has good cause or if the training place offered is not a reasonable opportunity <e> <s> this amendment seeks to define the circumstances in which an individual would have good cause for turning down a training place and would not be disqualified from benefit in doing so <e> <s> circumstances envisaged by the opposition may well be reasonable <e> <s> however it is unnecessary even dangerous for us to start trying to define by legislation what is meant by the term good cause <e> <s> there are too many variables too many sets of reasonable circumstances and by defining some we may well find that we limit the adjudicating authorities to consider only those thereby excluding others <e>", "<cs> my lords let me say at once that no decision has yet been made about the commencement date for any of the provisions of part i of the bill <e> <s> however there is no justification for any particular delay in bringing the provisions of clause into effect <e> <s> the government attach importance to the principles underlying the clause and see no reason <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are also unable to accept the amendment <e> <s> however having said that we have some sympathy with the point raised by my noble friend <e> <s> if he will withdraw the amendment i undertake that we shall consider the problem between now and the next stage of the bill to see whether there is a way in which we can meet my noble friends concern <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a matter that we have discussed at some length not only at this stage of the bill but at earlier stages <e> <s> the governments view has been expressed clearly on several occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i am a kind and honest man <e> <s> i shall therefore desist from deploying the brief which the noble lord rightly describes as long and complex and which the house in general may find unduly wearisome <e> <s> i take note of his point <e> <s> i think he well understands our position <e> <s> i hope that at this late hour he will see fit to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if i have the consent of noble lords to speak again perhaps i may write to the noble lord and place a copy of the letter in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords as i indicated in my original answer the figures are now going downward progressively very much as a result of government policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that it is right to ascribe the phenomenon which the noble baroness mentioned as the only cause of the illness to which she refers <e> <s> naturally we should like to bring steadily downwards the number of unemployed people which is what we are now doing because of course the effects of unemployment are most undesirable <e>", "<cs> my lords the rise was initiated by the government of our predecessors <e> <s> we had first to arrest that steadily increasing trend when we came into office <e>", "<cs> my lords we now have a whole range of training programmes to help the unemployed including the older unemployed and those who have been unemployed for a longer period <e> <s> those training programmes include the provision of basic education where necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i quite understand what the noble baroness is saying but if i catch her correctly she makes a good point <e> <s> it is important for all the different categories of unemployed people to have the training that is appropriate to their needs <e> <s> that is why we attach such importance to the training and the provision of training opportunities for unemployed people <e> <s> that policy lies at the heart of the recent announcement <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have those figures in front of me <e> <s> i shall happily write to the noble lord with them <e>", "<cs> my lords a great many other education authorities provide the type of service to which the noble lord has referred and which i prefer to the ilea <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord believes that he will believe anything <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i did not hear the noble lords question <e> <s> if he will put it again i shall try to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords unemployment was going up steadily when we came into office <e>", "<cs> my lords when we came into office it was necessary at once to introduce programmes to deal with that position but because of the depth of the problem it took a little while for those programmes to take effect <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly in not when we came into office unemployment was on a rising trend <e> <s> the figure which the noble lord has mentioned is perfectly correct <e> <s> that was the case <e> <s> naturally it took some time for the programmes we had to put into place then and subsequently to have an effect on that sharply rising trend <e> <s> i want to be fair to noble lords opposite <e> <s> the sharply rising trend was not confined to the united kingdom it was just particularly bad here <e>", "<cs> my lords as i am always accused of being unfair to noble lords opposite not only today but on previous occasions i thought it better to leave that observation to be made from behind me or beside me <e>", "<cs> my lords the desirable target which we seek to reach is one substantially below the present level <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether that figure is exactly accurate <e> <s> i agree that there are parts of the united kingdom where unemployment is still far too high <e> <s> that is what i said in the original answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that that is the case <e> <s> but it is a detail within the statistics that i shall check <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that the present arrangements under which the european parliament operates result in considerably increased costs <e> <s> that is not a satisfactory situation <e> <s> however the fact remains that the member states of the community must agree unanimously if any change is to be effected <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the government can be easily persuaded to accept a single site but we have no views as to where that should be <e> <s> however the fact remains that there is a good deal of sensitivity among the other member nations of the community and the likelihood of unanimity in the near or middle-term is pretty remote <e>", "<cs> my lords whether that particular location will be suitable i cannot say <e> <s> perhaps the way forward in this matter will be for members of the european parliament to reach a concerted view <e> <s> then no doubt the members of the community can consider the matter further <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a considerable degree of sensitivity in relation to this matter among the other member nations in particular not surprisingly those members in whose country the parliament meets from time to time <e> <s> i do not think that it would be helpful for the government to declare an interest in the way suggested by the noble lord <e> <s> however we recognise the difficulties created by the present arrangements and we shall support a proposition which brings those difficulties to an end <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the problem is not as simple as the noble lord suggests because the european parliament meets not only in strasbourg but elsewhere <e> <s> as i said earlier the problem can be resolved only by unanimity among the members of the community <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may well have a point but i dare say that there are other cities within the community which would take the same view <e>", "<cs> my lords i am bound to say that i too have enjoyed the delights to which my noble friend refers <e>", "<cs> my lords sometimes an immovable object comes up against an irresistible force and i daresay that this will be such a situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my voice to those who have offered thanks to my noble friend for this opportunity to pay tribute to the members of our reserve forces and in particular to the volunteer reserves who give so willingly and enthusiastically of their time <e> <s> they do indeed deserve to be called to quote what i think were originally winston churchills words twice a citizen <e> <s> they make a vital contribution to the defence of this country and to europe as a whole <e> <s> no other country can point to such a proud tradition of volunteer service <e>", "<cs> my lords this is indeed a very important amendment whose effects would be considerable if it were to be accepted <e> <s> it could have an impact not necessarily in the way intended on many industrial disputes or the way in which they are organised and the balloting that is or is not carried out in connection with them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord mottistone to the noble baroness and to all noble lords who have spoken for setting out their views clearly in respect of what has been proposed including the amendment in the name of the noble lord lord howie of troon <e> <s> we have of course gone over the same ground at each stage of the bill despite the fact that your lordships house took a clear decision early on in our proceedings that unions should not be permitted to continue appointing their general secretaries <e> <s> nonetheless as my noble friend lord dundee promised at report stage we have looked very carefully at the whole issue to see whether we could meet the concerns expressed in our debates <e> <s> i am sorry to say that the government can no more accept either of these amendments than they could the earlier ones of my noble friend lord mottistone on the same theme <e>", "<cs> my lords i was coming to the end of my remarks and i remain of the view that the general secretary of a trade union whether or not he is a member of the executive committee has considerable importance and influence <e> <s> he is certainly thought to be so not only in the minds of the members but in the minds of the general public who often see such people on television for example and hear from them through other sections of the media <e> <s> i believe that such a person of influence should represent the views and aspirations of the membership <e> <s> i ask my noble friend to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said a few moments ago in answer to the amendment moved by my noble friend lord mottistone the arguments apply similarly to this amendment we believe not only that senior trade union officers should be experts in administration and managing the affairs of their union but that they should also be elected in accordance with the views of the members of their particular union <e> <s> it is therefore for that reason that i cannot accept this amendment any more than i could accept that of my noble friend a few moments ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i am informed that the noble lord is out of order to speak again after i have spoken <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may read from the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am again grateful to the noble baroness for setting out her views so clearly and for writing to my noble friend lord dundee to give a little advance notice of her amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for proposing this helpful clarification <e> <s> i am happy to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am yet again grateful to the noble lord for his helpful clarification <e> <s> i am happy to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to reply on amendment no <e> <s> and to speak at the same time to amendment no <e> <s> as did the noble lord <e> <s> these amendments would defeat the basic intention of the clause which is to prevent unions from aggregating ballot results at selected workplaces <e> <s> the clause allows a union to hold a single aggregated ballot of members at different workplaces where each member in the balloting constituency has a factor in common with some or all of the other members in the constituency <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of the amendment is apparently to make sure that the duties set out in schedule to the employment and training act to which section of that act refers will continue to apply to the commission after this bill comes into force <e> <s> i should like to reassure the noble lord straightaway that the duties set out in schedule will still apply in future <e> <s> there is no conflict between schedule of the act and new section of the act as substituted by clause of the bill <e> <s> new section is not an exhaustive recital of the commissions powers and duties <e> <s> the purpose of new section is simply to say what the commissions job is and it does not affect the provisions of schedule <e> <s> the power to appoint advisers for example <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mccarthy is technically correct in saying that clause could be brought into effect very swiftly after royal assent <e> <s> however i suggest that it is simpler and more convenient to bring the clause into effect on royal assent rather than making a separate commencement order for one clause <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have not yet reached a final view on the full range of matters which the code of practice will cover <e> <s> as i said the only matter which they have so far thought it right to include in the code of practice is the matter relating to ballots prior to industrial action <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may take advice on that point and write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first reply to the noble lord lord wedderburn <e> <s> parliament has agreed that there should be a statement on the ballot paper in the terms that i read out when i was moving this amendment <e> <s> if noble lords will allow me i shall repeat the words <e>", "<cs> my lords in the few seconds that i have had to take advice on this matter i am advised that it does <e> <s> perhaps i can take further more considered advice and write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite certain that in the latter case described by the noble lord there would be no question of the union falling foul of this amendment <e> <s> nor is it the intention to prevent the union expressing its views to the member <e> <s> we are trying to prevent the union misleading the member at the point at which he expresses his view on the voting paper <e> <s> that is the purpose of this amendment <e> <s> i believe that is a right and proper purpose <e> <s> i believe this amendment achieves it <e> <s> i commend the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot vouch for the accuracy or otherwise of mrs castles diaries <e> <s> the problem is that the events to which she referred took place in when of course there was a labour government in office <e> <s> i am afraid that i do not have access to the cabinet papers of that time <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said on nd march there was no contract let in as far as i know <e> <s> as the noble lord has indicated there was a contract in to which i understand there were no fewer than nine variations at various times <e> <s> i am advised that none of those was in <e>", "<cs> my lords the details of the contract certainly are <e>", "<cs> my lords i have in fact read both diaries at various times <e> <s> i enjoyed them both but it may be that lady castles memory was slightly in error <e>", "<cs> my lords unfortunately to do as the noble lord suggests would contravene the nonproliferation treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the noble lord thinks that there has been some secret contract for the supply of this material which somehow we are trying to conceal from the house and from parliament <e> <s> i assure the noble lord that given the fact that this was in and i do not have access to the papers so far as i can tell that is not the case <e> <s> if the noble lord would like to call on me at the ministry of defence i should be happy to try to discuss the matter with him in more detail to see whether i can set his mind at rest <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend has put his finger on the real problem <e> <s> that problem is uppermost in our minds in conducting the review <e>", "<cs> my lords the importance of may day depends on whom one asks <e> <s> in scotland i understand it marks the act of union <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the requirement to fix easter stems from the easter act <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the easter act as my noble friends remind me <e> <s> speaking from memory i believe that the requirement is that there should first be agreement among all the churches <e> <s> as yet i understand that the greek orthodox church has not made up its mind <e>", "<cs> my lords we are considering the proposition that we should have a more equal spread of the various bank holidays <e> <s> we are therefore considering whether it would be possible to find a date some time in the autumn but what particular festival it should celebrate has yet to be decided <e> <s> i understand that trafalgar day is one of those being considered <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier in scotland it marks the act of union <e> <s> i dare say that that holiday is not so regarded there <e>", "<cs> my lords i have much sympathy with the noble lord but the problem is that st davids day is st march and not the middle of october <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose we could but i think that that would be a bit boring <e>", "<cs> my lords st july is not a favourite date for the additional bank holiday because we already have quite a few in the summer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that there is a very strong body of feeling about this particular application <e> <s> however i hope that the noble lord will understand that i really must not comment on propositions for or against it for fear of anticipating the outcome of the inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords i dare say that that is just the kind of consideration that the applicants would want to put before the public inquiry <e> <s> in due course the inspector will no doubt comment on them <e>", "<cs> my lords again i have no doubt that the kind of views expressed by the noble viscount will be put forward at the public inquiry <e> <s> i am sure that they will be reflected in the inspectors report <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only suggest to the noble lord that he seeks an opportunity to put those views to the public inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords we support the current united states initiatives aimed at achieving renewed progress towards a negotiated settlement of the arab/israel conflict <e> <s> an essential element in the united states proposals is the convening of an international conference <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that in recent months the united kingdom view about a number of aspects of israeli policy has been made very clear <e> <s> however we support the current united states initiatives aimed at bringing the parties together to try to reach a solution to this longstanding and tragic problem <e>", "<cs> my lords the united kingdom has been supporting the resolutions in the united nations security council <e> <s> i agree that recently the united states vetoed such a resolution <e> <s> however the united states has supported a number of other resolutions in the security council <e> <s> i believe the way forward is to support the initiative which it is now proposing <e>", "<cs> my lords we are hoping that on reflection the arab countries concerned will see the sense of what is proposed <e> <s> but it is true to say that some elements in israel have not accepted the proposals either we hope that on reflection they will see fit to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said we certainly support the herculean efforts of the united states secretary of state to secure acceptance of his proposals <e> <s> it is i think worth remembering that the first great step towards peace in the middle east was the camp david accord of some years ago which was likewise the result of herculean united states efforts <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the occupied territories our view is that the israelis should withdraw from the territories occupied since as part of a comprehensive peace plan perhaps in accordance with security council resolution <e> <s> meanwhile the israelis should administer their occupation in compliance with international law and basic human rights standards <e>", "<cs> my lords we issued a statement at the time if the noble lord is referring to the th april meeting <e> <s> perhaps i can let the noble lord have a copy <e>", "<cs> my lords mr peres the israeli foreign minister and deputy prime minister has indeed been supporting the efforts of mr shultz <e> <s> unfortunately mr shamir appears to think otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that the acceptance at least of this conference by the soviet union would be an important factor <e> <s> but there are many other important factors as well including that which refers to the need to accept the right of the state of israel to exist with secure borders <e>", "<cs> my lords we have certainly endorsed the right of self-determination as regards the palestinian people <e> <s> we have deplored very strongly some of the things which are presently going on in the occupied territories <e>", "<cs> the clear intention of the government in clause is that welsh should be part of the national curriculum in wales <e> <s> for those welsh children who receive a bilingual education welsh should be a core subject along with english maths and science <e> <s> in order to achieve this it has been necessary to define the schools concerned which the bill refers to as welsh-speaking schools <e> <s> bilingual education in wales has never been previously defined in statute and it has not been an easy task to arrive at a satisfactory definition <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as concerns the inf treaty i can assure the noble lord that there is no question of trying to circumvent it <e> <s> indeed the alliance warmly supports the agreement and we hope for early ratification <e> <s> we have certainly not taken any decisions about the modernisation of our own systems <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only repeat that there is no question of our seeking to circumvent the inf treaty <e> <s> it is perhaps worth noting that since the number of allied warheads in europe has decreased from a figure of around in that year to around now <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord is quite right to say that alliance decisions on nuclear disarmament must be multilateral decisions within the alliance <e> <s> we must move step by step in a balanced and verifiable way <e>", "<cs> my lords no decisions have been taken to substitute anything for anything else so the question of circumvention as the noble lord suggests does not arise <e> <s> however let me underline again that there is no question of this government or indeed any other government within the western alliance who are party to this agreement seeking to undermine it <e> <s> we wholly support it and look forward to early ratification <e>", "<cs> my lords of course it is the case that the united kingdom was not strictly a party to the inf agreement <e> <s> however we are concerned with it because some of the facilities were based in this country <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that the british government were certainly kept fully informed during the united states negotiations in connection with that agreement and indeed we are still being kept fully informed by the united states in connection <e>", "<cs> my lords the original twin-track decision as it was called taken in was made under what was then the new threat of the deployment of the ss systems <e> <s> the allies took a decision at that time to respond to that threat by the deployment of the intermediate range systems as the noble lord will be aware and at the same time they addressed vigorously the question of a control agreement for those systems <e> <s> that policy has proved to be overwhelmingly successful in that for the first time we have an agreement between the superpowers to eliminate a whole class of nuclear weapons and to make a significant reduction in the number of warheads to which i referred earlier <e> <s> i believe that the way forward is by such measures of arms control and i hope that your lordships agree with me <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only tell the noble lord again that there is no question of the allies seeking to undermine or circumvent the intermediate range weapons agreement that was made recently <e> <s> it now only remains for that agreement to be ratified by the united states senate <e> <s> it was an agreement on land-based intermediate range systems and it will be scrupulously observed by this side <e>", "<cs> i too am trying to save time <e> <s> i assure the noble baroness that i shall not detain her for a moment longer than is necessary <e> <s> there are four broad aims underlying financial delegation <e> <s> the first is to reduce unnecessary bureaucracy secondly to give governors and heads the powers to match their responsibilities thirdly to enable schools to target the available resources to meet the needs and priorities of the pupils in the schools in other words to make schools more responsive to local needs and finally and most important of all to encourage the efficient and effective management and deployment of resources since better management means better education <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may reply to the noble baroness in two ways <e> <s> first some of the specific problems to which she refers are addressed by amendments which we shall be considering later during the course of the bill <e> <s> i understand that some governors will face the future under these new arrangements with trepidation but i believe that the great majority will think that the future will be better and that their job will be much more satisfying given the new proposals contained in the bill <e> <s> i believe also that those who may be facing the future with trepidation will find that when the new system is in place their job is altogether more worth while <e>", "<cs> the answer to that question is simple if i may so to the noble baroness <e> <s> it is surely beyond peradventure the case that people given much greater freedom flexibility and responsibility in doing their job will find that job more satisfying <e>", "<cs> i shall not follow my noble friend down that particular path but in reply to the noble lord lord dormand of easington i would explain that the idea is that the governing bodies have the responsibility to manage their schools within the kind of budgets that the schools have been used to having recently <e> <s> this is not a measure that provides more or less money for the educational system it simply ensures that the money that is available is employed more efficiently <e> <s> i was glad that the noble lord acknowledged and as i understood it accepted the proposed improvement in the arrangements <e>", "<cs> so far as inner london is concerned of course this bill contains proposals about the arrangements for inner london and the government apprehend that in the light of the proposals contained in the bill with regard to inner london it is likely that a further short time will be required <e>", "<cs> these amendments relate to the implementation of schemes of financial delegation and in particular to the training of governors <e> <s> the government recognise the vital importance of school governors being able to carry out their functions effectively both through training and through a coherent scheme of delegation with active local education authority support <e> <s> the provisions of this chapter together with the specific grant proposals for recently announced by my right honourable friend are designed to achieve precisely that <e>", "<cs> the sum of money to which i have just referred which was million and included the million specifically for the training of governors was announced by my right honourable friend quite recently <e> <s> it is money that will be made available to the local education authorities in order to enable them to implement the schemes that they will be bringing forward for his approval <e>", "<cs> i shall see what i can do to find some additional information for my noble friend between now and the next stage <e> <s> the noble baroness lady lockwood rightly pointed out that the requirements of governors for training will vary very much from place to place and from school to school <e> <s> no doubt some governors and others will have much experience in these sorts of affairs they may have experience in business as well <e> <s> they will be more than willing and more than able to discharge their new duties perhaps with the minimum of additional training <e> <s> there will be others however who do not have that range of experience and for whom the training would clearly have to be in greater depth and more comprehensive <e>", "<cs> of course i accept that <e> <s> i believe that a business background might be useful for the financial aspects of managing a school <e> <s> but the educational and social aspects would call for a different range of experience <e>", "<cs> i understand that the vice-chancellors interest in this matter has already been engaged <e> <s> indeed a video has been prepared for this purpose <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can assure the noble lord lord kilmarnock that there is nothing in this bill to affect the provisions of the act to which <e>", "<cs> the main thrust of financial delegation is to make individual schools responsible for their budgets since spending decisions are surely best made by those most closely involved with the school <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord is asking how the system will deal for example with a maverick board of governors who might as the noble lord suggests want to invest all the school funds on the at kempton rather than running the school in a proper way that would be wholly irresponsible <e>", "<cs> presumably the local education authority which will be overseeing the management of all the schools within its area will have a view on that <e> <s> but where a school employs only the part-time services of a certain teacher it would only be responsible for part of the costs of that teacher <e>", "<cs> let me say at once that we fully recognise that appropriate leave arrangements for governors and effective provision for clerking and other administration are central to the success of delegation in both voluntary and county schools <e> <s> i am answering on amendment no <e> <s> and also on amendment no <e> <s> unless it is desired that that should be moved separately <e>", "<cs> i agree that that should be so <e> <s> however i should remind my noble friend that it was agreed that it would be debated with amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> turning to amendment no <e> <s> section of the employment protection consolidation act provides for governors to be entitled to time off in order to perform their duties effectively <e> <s> we fully support this and indeed the bill extends this provision to the governors of grant maintained schools <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> would however go <e>", "<cs> the issue is whether people should have paid time <e> <s> time is provided for by other legislation <e>", "<cs> i accept what the right reverend prelate says <e> <s> from my experience of the territorial army a year or so ago i recall that we considered once whether we should require employers to give members of the ta time to attend to their duties <e> <s> we soon concluded that imposing a duty on employers to provide paid time for personnel to undertake such duties was not generally in the interests of the employees themselves <e> <s> therefore the proposition was not proceeded with <e> <s> i believe that similar considerations apply in this case <e>", "<cs> i very much share my noble friends view of the increasingly important role that clerks will have to play in the future <e> <s> as governors take on more responsibilities they will place a premium on good advice about their statutory and other responsibilities and on efficient organisation of their business <e> <s> clerks are there to provide just that <e>", "<cs> i believe that i can confirm what my noble friend has mentioned <e> <s> both categories of schools to which he has referred will receive a budget in relation to the size of their student roll the ages of the children and so forth and will be at liberty to pay the clerks or not as they think fit <e>", "<cs> i believe not <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has indicated the draft guidance to which i have referred on a number of occasions this evening refers to the health and safety arrangements that should apply in these cases <e> <s> however i think that the noble lord has made a powerful case <e> <s> if therefore he will withdraw his amendment now i will undertake that the matter will be considered further between now and the next stage with a view to considering the possibility of bringing forward an appropriate government amendment <e>", "<cs> at the outset perhaps i may reassure the noble lord lord mcnair that the draft circular does not rule out an lea taking account of the repair of schools or for that matter any other factor that it considers relevant <e> <s> what paragraphs and do is to give guidance on factors which the secretary of state thinks are particularly relevant <e> <s> but the noble lord may be assured that providing funds for repairs for example is certainly not ruled out <e>", "<cs> the government are fully committed to the intention behind the amendment <e> <s> it is essential that the support services necessary for the effective delivery of education to pupils with special needs should be preserved under schemes of delegation <e>", "<cs> the government have considerable sympathy with the intention behind my noble friends amendment which would allow primary schools with fewer than pupils to opt in to delegation <e> <s> we believe that the benefits of delegation should be extended to as many schools as possible <e> <s> pilot schemes have shown that all schools including the smallest primaries for example in northumberland can benefit from the freedom to target resources on their own educational needs and priorities <e>", "<cs> these amendments concern the appointment and dismissal of staff at schools with delegated budgets and procedures for suspension discipline and grievance <e> <s> they would retain various provisions on appointment dismissal and suspension deriving from the education no <e> <s> act and would strike out from the bill the procedures in schedule which will regulate such matters when schools have a delegated budget <e>", "<cs> subsection of clause is concerned with the allocation of costs incurred by a local education authority which arise from the dismissal or premature retirement of any member of staff <e> <s> the subsection provides that the costs which arise in such cases shall not be met from the schools budget share for any financial year unless the authority has good reason for deducting those costs from that share <e>", "<cs> if it would help the noble lord i shall consider whether the wording can be clarified <e> <s> i believe that it means what i said it means but if the noble lord would like me to consider it further i am happy to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my original answer the arrangements are perfectly straightforward <e> <s> the united kingdom will retain sovereignty over its territory and territorial waters as the noble lord would expect <e> <s> therefore there is no question of the united states acquiring sovereignty <e>", "<cs> my lords i greatly admire the noble lords ingenuity but i do not believe that the inf treaty arises from this question <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that i must say the same to my noble friend as i said to the noble lord lord irving <e> <s> that is another question and if he tables it i shall be happy to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords the arrangements for taking charge of the emergency services in such a situation would be exactly as with any other emergency namely primarily the british police <e>", "<cs> what more can i say other than to underline the observation which was made from a sedentary position from the privy counsellors bench on my right <e>", "<cs> that was not a ballot of the kind which is envisaged under the bill <e> <s> if parents vote that would be a very respectable turnout at least of them must still be in favour <e> <s> to take my example further of the parents could be in favour and yet the application would not go forward <e> <s> i fear that that would lead to discord and disputes about whether one or two names on the admissions register should or should not have been there <e> <s> parents will not be able to understand why a proposal which had such strong support is not even to be considered by the secretary of state <e> <s> they may begin compaigning immediately for a further ballot to be held the following year <e> <s> that cannot be good for the stability of the school community <e> <s> it would be better to have the issue out there and then <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may deal first with the amendments moved by the noble lord lord somers <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that in moving amendment no <e> <s> the noble lord spoke at the same time to amendments nos <e> <s> b and <e> <s> my noble friend lord nugent of guildford and my noble friend lord renton have also spoken to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i think i am right in saying that the noble lord lord peston having moved amendment no <e> <s> za was speaking at the same time to amendments nos <e> <s> da da db za za zb and zc <e> <s> i mention those only because i believe it is of help to the chair to indicate precisely which amendments we are discussing at this time <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble baroness will not be surprised to hear that the amendments are not acceptable to the government <e> <s> let me make it absolutely clear that the fears expressed in connection with subsections and are wholly groundless <e> <s> these provisions are not as some have claimed the trojan horse through which my right honourable friend the secretary of state will be able to exercise ruthless centralising control over grant-maintained schools and it is preposterous to suggest otherwise <e> <s> indeed the noble baroness was kind enough to say that she did not think that my right honourable friend was likely to do any such thing <e>", "<cs> as has been explained the amendment would require a parent governor to resign from office if he or she ceased to be a parent of a registered pupil at the school <e> <s> the education no <e> <s> act permitted governors at maintained schools to serve out their four-year terms of office even if their child had left the school <e> <s> that might not be as long as three years without a child at the school it depended entirely upon when they were appointed in the first place <e> <s> the chances are that it would be a much shorter period <e>", "<cs> i fully understand the safeguards that it is proposed should be added to the bill <e> <s> however it is the governments firm view that as it stands the bill provides adequately for the interests of parents of children at grant-maintained schools to be secured and the amendments are therefore unnecessary <e> <s> i should like to explain why <e>", "<cs> there is a limit to the avenues of independent review of actions that can be arranged <e> <s> the fact is that the parliamentary commissioner is the parliamentary commissioner for administration <e> <s> his remit runs when the secretary of state has done something or has failed to do something which in the view of the complainant he should have done <e>", "<cs> the noble lord must not put words into my mouth <e> <s> the role of the parliamentary commissioner for administration is to look into cases of alleged maladministration by the government <e> <s> that clearly cannot arise until the government in this case the secretary of state has done something or failed to do something which the ombudsman or the commissioner is invited to examine <e> <s> there is already the committee i have referred to which i hope will be conducted under the arrangements of the council on tribunals <e> <s> i believe that that is the right procedure for determining difficulties of this kind <e> <s> the procedure is a good deal better than exists in many other walks of life <e> <s> i believe it is the right way to proceed in this case <e>", "<cs> that is not quite correct i do not believe that he does <e> <s> for example he does not have the right to inquire into the actions of the governors <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord graham has raised an important issue here <e> <s> i believe that the bill already provides an adequate framework within which grant-maintained schools and local education authorities can work together if they so wish <e> <s> let me suggest a number of important areas where the government have taken action on this score <e> <s> in clause of the bill we have empowered governors to act as agents for local education authorities in providing youth or adult education at their school <e>", "<cs> that depends on the basis on which the secretary of states grant is calculated <e> <s> in principle i do not see any reason why not <e>", "<cs> i am rather perplexed because the noble lord accuses me of being too brusque and the noble baroness lady seear said that i had too much sweetness and light which she did not believe <e>", "<cs> i am mortified to find that i have not provided the noble baroness with sufficient sweetness and light <e> <s> i am not often accused of that <e> <s> the fact is that we consider that a more informal arrangement along the lines proposed in the bill is better than the rather tramline arrangement proposed by this amendment <e> <s> for that reason we do not think that it is a useful addition to the bill and i hope that the committee will not accept it <e>", "<cs> i believe that these amendments are an unnecessary refinement of the procedures in clauses to which are already designed to produce ample evidence of the nature and strength of views about grant-maintained status before any formal application comes to my right honourable friend <e> <s> let me first emphasise that what we are talking about here is not a decision to become a grant-maintained school <e> <s> only my right honourable friend can take that decision <e> <s> the governors resolutions to which the amendments refer are simply the first step in ensuring that the issue of whether the school should apply for grant-maintained status is properly aired <e>", "<cs> i shall come to that in a moment <e> <s> perhaps i may add that these amendments would also introduce an unprecedented provision because there are no circumstances in which the governing body would currently take a decision at a maintained <e>", "<cs> there may still be circumstances where so few people turn up that the meeting could not take place <e>", "<cs> i am afraid my only answer is that i have never fully understood the intricacies of proportional representation <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord wishes for a further explanation i am happy to give it <e> <s> if let us say the lea members decided to absent themselves at least one-quarter of the governors would not be there for the vote <e> <s> most of the governors present at the meeting would have to be in favour in order to achieve a majority vote <e> <s> that is the difficulty i see with these amendments <e>", "<cs> i am extremely sorry if my modest mathematical attainments are not sufficient to enable me to assist on the education reform bill <e> <s> i am also sorry if i have not made this point as clear as i should have done <e> <s> if the lea members were to absent themselves from a meeting a quarter of of the governors overall would not be present and so very many more than half of those present would have to vote in order to achieve the requirements set out <e> <s> that is not a proposition i am prepared to accept <e>", "<cs> i am not going to argue with the noble lords arithmetic which i am happy to concede is likely to be much better than mine <e> <s> if a large proportion of the governors absent themselves from a meeting a greater proportion of those present have to vote in order to achieve the requirements set out <e> <s> that is not the proposition that i am willing to accept <e>", "<cs> in other words more than a simple majority of those who may be present at the meeting <e>", "<cs> i hope that i shall not be accused of excessive cynicism if i say that i sometimes wonder whether calls for in-depth consultation at every stage represent a commitment not to clarity but to obfuscation and whether the prime objective may be not to ensure that everyone has a say but to make the demands of the process appear so daunting to the governors that they will recoil from entering upon it <e> <s> the amendment tempts me to that conclusion <e>", "<cs> on the assumption that i am replying only to amendment no <e> <s> ba i apologise to the noble lord lord tordoff if there has been some change of which he was not informed let me start by emphasising yet again that what we are talking about is not a decision to become a grant-maintained school <e> <s> only the secretary of state can take that decision <e> <s> a parental petition is simply one way in which a group of parents can ensure that the issue of whether a school should apply for grant-maintained status is properly aired <e> <s> it would be ridiculous to require that a group of parents equal to per cent <e> <s> of the numbers of pupils in the school would have to sign a petition which in itself <e>", "<cs> we recognise that the views of parents of pupils in feeder primaries are relevant to consideration of the question whether a school should become grant-maintained <e> <s> but i am not at all convinced that the provisions relating to the parental ballot are the most appropriate place for such views to be taken into account <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i can give no assurance of that kind <e>", "<cs> i am told that there is a view in various quarters that we have not got as far as we should have done in this bill by this time <e> <s> i am anxious to help in any way i can <e> <s> perhaps i can say that i am prepared to take amendment no <e> <s> bc away and have a look at it and see whether we can move some way to meet the point which the noble lord makes <e>", "<cs> the amendment seeks to provide for grant-maintained schools to be able to reacquire lea-maintained status after a minimum of five years existence <e> <s> the commitment to become a grant-maintained school is not something to be undertaken lightly <e> <s> that must be clear to prospective governors and parents from the very outset there should be no easy way out thereafter if things are felt to be getting a little tough <e> <s> possibly some governors may find that the commitment to run a newly-constituted grant-maintained school proves heavier than they had anticipated <e> <s> i need not spell out how undesirable it would be if in such circumstances this amendment provided them with a mechanism whereby they could simply change their minds and hand responsibility back to the local education authority <e>", "<cs> the short answer to the noble lord is no <e> <s> the noble baroness lady masham asked what would happen to the children if a school closed <e> <s> the answer is that they would be transferred elsewhere <e> <s> the likely scenario of closure is where rolls are falling in more than one school <e> <s> if one school closes the children at that school would be transferred elsewhere <e>", "<cs> not necessarily <e> <s> it depends on what other schools are available in the area <e>", "<cs> we have made it clear that we have no difficulty in principle with the possibility of smaller grant-maintained schools <e> <s> we believe that it should be a progressive matter <e> <s> there are powers in the bill to make that possible <e> <s> indeed there are powers in the bill to enable it to happen fairly quickly <e> <s> but as a general rule it probably will not happen until later <e>", "<cs> the arrangements for setting up the curriculum were covered in the earlier debate on the bill and the noble baroness was involved in those discussions <e> <s> naturally if the number of students at a school declined considerably then no doubt there would be difficulties in maintaining proper classes in some subjects <e> <s> it is in such circumstances that schools will consider whether it is sensible for them to <e>", "<cs> student rolls in schools change <e> <s> one of the feaures of the policy we are now putting forward is that parents should have a greater choice as to where to send their children to school <e>", "<cs> i shall deal first with amendments nos <e> <s> a and za <e> <s> i do not think that it is particularly useful to require governors and parents to consult voluntary and community organisations although of course there is nothing to prevent them from doing so if they wish <e> <s> but again the proper time for such views to be taken into account is when the secretary of state is considering a formal proposal <e>", "<cs> i am quite certain that the department would take a serious view of that matter and would wish to make sure that whatever was necessary was being done and that the guidelines were being adhered to <e> <s> i am also sure that governing bodies once they are aware of the guidelines will be anxious to comply with them <e>", "<cs> the amendment would prevent parents or governors from pursuing an application for grant-maintained status until the secretary of state had published the definition of a parent for this purpose in a schedule to the bill <e> <s> the government believe that this would be an unnecessary and over-prescriptive provision but i can reassure the noble baroness that we intend to provide in an appropriate manner all the information and guidance which governors will require to carry out their duties effectively in this context <e>", "<cs> on the assumption that i am replying to amendments nos <e> <s> b and ba perhaps i may say that so far as concerns the former amendment amendment no <e> <s> b i have some sympathy with that proposition and should like an opportunity to consider the matter further if the noble baroness will agree to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> so far as amendment no <e> <s> c is concerned while i do not see any need to include such an amendment in the bill the objectives of the amendment are quite laudible and i would be willing to consider whether it might be possible to put in some words which met the point which the noble baroness has made <e>", "<cs> i am glad of this opportunity to restate the governments commitment to the view that all schools including those that become grant-maintained should be responsible to the needs of their local community and should play an active part in the community wherever this is practicable <e> <s> we are well aware that in a fair number of schools education is provided and facilities made available not just for the registered pupils but also for other members of the community often during the day as well as in the evening <e> <s> where such schools apply successfully for grant-maintained status we intend that there should be no barrier to continued community access to their facilities provided that the prime educational purpose of their premises is safeguarded and moneys provided for school purposes are not being used to subsidise other provision <e>", "<cs> those are the facilities that the government wish to see continued as the noble lord rightly says in many school premises <e> <s> they will continue on exactly the same basis <e>", "<cs> this bill does not change the position in any way <e> <s> the position of such organisations under these arrangements will in the future be exactly the same as it is now <e>", "<cs> i recognise the purpose of the amendment <e> <s> it is to place on the face of the bill a provision enshrining the governments commitment that schools which become grant-maintained will be in the same financial position as they would have been had they remained under local authority control <e> <s> this remains the governments firm intention <e> <s> i am glad to be able to reassure the noble lord that provision to achieve that will be incorporated in the grant regulations which will be made under clause <e> <s> the government consider that this is preferable to the incorporation of a requirement in the bill itself for the reason exemplified by the amendment that it is not practically possible to provide succinctly for all eventualities <e> <s> i hope in the light of that assurance the noble lord will feel able not to press his amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i quite understand what the noble lord has in mind but i shall look into the matter further and write to him if i can help him <e>", "<cs> my information is that there has not been a reduction in classroom violence following the abolition of corporal punishment <e> <s> on the contrary i believe that there has been an increase <e>", "<cs> my lords on skill shortages evidence suggests that the shortages are concentrated in certain occupations and areas of the country <e> <s> for example in london and the south east the citb is researching particular problems of attracting youngsters into construction and will be reporting this summer <e>", "<cs> my lords the citb is one of half a dozen or so industry training boards and the main driving force behind the citb are the employers in the industry concerned <e> <s> however the government are playing their part by providing some million towards the costs of the yts scheme to which i have referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree of course that the industry is no place for untrained cowboys <e> <s> that is why the role of the citb is so important <e> <s> i welcome the favourable comments that have been made about the boards activities <e>", "<cs> my lords the main impetus behind the training needed for this industry as it is for others comes from the employers themselves through the medium of this training board <e> <s> clearly their activities have not been without success witness the encouraging figures i was able to report earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords it is of course important that whatever training is provided is <e>", "<cs> the noble lord and the noble baroness may rest assured that the government are in complete sympathy with the intention behind this amendment to ensure that the inner london councils when filling their education-related posts first consider applications from ilea employees <e> <s> the government repeatedly made clear their intention in this respect in another place <e> <s> indeed the words reasonable preference were used and these are very similar to the phrase reasonable priority used in this amendment <e>", "<cs> it is the case that there are very many hard-working effective and successful administrative employees working in ilea <e> <s> but the government have also made it clear that they believe that there are areas within that particular ambit which may be the cause for some concern as regards ilea <e> <s> i dare say that there will be some administrative officials in ilea who will not necessarily find employment with the boroughs <e> <s> i hope that they will find appropriate employment in another or in a related field <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that owing to a number of changes in the front bench team or at least in the allocation of amendments i have not had a chance to see the letter of the noble lord lord rochester <e> <s> but i hope nonetheless that what i say will reassure him and indeed the noble lord lord morton of shuna too <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is quite right <e>", "<cs> i want to make it quite clear that this clause is not about diminishing employees rights or adversely affecting employees <e> <s> rather the clause is about ensuring that power and responsibility for the governing body go hand in hand <e> <s> where the governing body takes a decision it rather than the local education authority must be answerable for it <e> <s> employees must be able to claim and enforce their rights against the governors <e> <s> the amendment is therefore unnecessary as the clause is not about diminishing employees rights <e>", "<cs> as has already been said this matter was discussed at great length the other night <e>", "<cs> i can only repeat that the matter <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble earl will not mind my reminding him that the lib-lab pact was in force at that time <e>", "<cs> i can only add that with regard to the order-making power an assurance has been given that on report we shall bring forward an amendment to require that there be statutory consultation before any order is made <e> <s> that consultation will involve local authority employers trade unions and the bodies representing the interests of the governors of voluntary schools <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that the hour of the night does not hide the fact that to add such a <e>", "<cs> i think i have gone as far as i can with the assurances that i have offered <e> <s> for example i have repeated the assurance about the statutory basis upon which we propose to make the consultation and that we shall ensure that it is properly and sensibly conducted under the auspices of the bill with the local authority associations organisations representing teaching and non- teaching staff and bodies representing the interests of governors of voluntary schools <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will accept the assurance that i give that there is no secret purpose behind this clause in any way adversely to affect the rights of employees <e> <s> on the contrary we want to see those rights properly secured and this clause is intended to achieve that <e>", "<cs> my lords the questions i answered on th june to which i have referred today were the ones to which i sought to give answers not the questions that the noble lord has subsequently posed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that the house will be much impressed by the intervention of the noble and gallant lord speaking from the position of experience and importance that he does <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord i think that that is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords the policy of making europe or the rest of the world safe for conventional war is not one that i support <e>", "<cs> my lords the remarks of the noble lord greatly tempt me however i hope that the house will forgive me if i do not sucumb to that temptation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am greatly obliged to my noble friend for her appreciative words directed to the work of the royal navy in the gulf <e> <s> i was very interested to hear the second part of my noble friends supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the matter was discussed at the recent summit certainly not as it might affect the royal navy <e> <s> however i can say that talks are going on with dutch and belgian authorities about closer co-ordination with their forces in the region <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am not aware of the details surrounding the events to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> i shall be happy to look into the matter to see whether there is any clarification i can give the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is right <e> <s> there was an attack on the esso demetia a week or so ago <e> <s> that ship was operating well outside the area in which the royal navy is normally able to offer assistance and was clearly aware of the risks being run <e> <s> the size of our fleet in the gulf is of course limited we judge that it is not wise to spread our resources so thinly as to offer accompaniment to every part of the gulf <e>", "<cs> my lords the study to which my noble friend referred has now been completed <e> <s> indeed the document has been received and is at present being studied <e> <s> however it remains the view of her majestys government that the gibraltar government can afford to meet those commitments <e>", "<cs> my lords no that is not the case <e> <s> i think that the legal liability in the matter the government are in no doubt about this rests with the gibraltar government <e> <s> as regards the first part of the noble lords supplementary question no formal request has been received <e>", "<cs> my lords the economy in gibraltar is as flourishing as is that of this country <e> <s> therefore we see no reason why these sums should not be found from the funds generally available to the gibraltar government <e>", "<cs> my lords the government will be studying the report to which my noble friend referred <e> <s> however as i said we have no reason to believe that gibraltars economy will not continue to flourish as it has done recently and therefore these sums should be readily found from within that governments own resources <e>", "<cs> my lords mr dukakiss views are of course his own <e> <s> the governments views on the sdi have been made known on a number of occasions <e> <s> i shall not repeat them now <e> <s> they are of course in line with the four points that my right honourable friend agreed when she was in washington some years ago and which have not changed in the intervening period <e> <s> as for mr dukakiss wider views i do not think that i want to comment on those any more than i wish to comment on his others <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that the government have no complaints about the consultation which has gone on between the united states and the other allied governments <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lord would take as much exception to that or he ought to as he would if mr dukakis were to comment upon the noble lords views <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble and learned friend has rightly pointed to the danger of commenting upon the views of presidential candidates <e> <s> it is probably equally unwise to comment upon the views of some parliamentary candidates in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords the soviet union is conducting a wide range of research programmes into activities of that kind <e> <s> the sdi programme is of course a research programme no more and no less <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i shall dictate to the united states either before or after the presidential election <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will be aware british firms are already involved in a number of sdi-related contracts <e> <s> the government are happy that that should be so <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i am quite happy to support the observations of president reagan so far as concerns the star wars programme <e> <s> as i have said before it is a research programme upon which the soviet union is equally actively involved <e> <s> the united kingdom therefore supports the united states sdi programme and is involved in it <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no reason to think that that will happen <e> <s> united kingdom institutions and firms which involve themselves in the work to which the noble lord refers are doing so in accordance with contracts which in my view are not likely to be altered <e>", "<cs> my lords we consider that nuclear weapons will continue to be an essential part of natos deterrent for the foreseeable future <e> <s> but like other nato governments we support arms control agreements and believe that they should be stringently verified <e> <s> we play a part in ensuring that that is the case for the inf treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that verification is a critical aspect of such treaties <e> <s> however i can assure the noble lord that we were fully consulted by the united states on the verification and other provisions of the inf treaty <e> <s> the noble lord may he aware that there is an agreement between the united states and the so-called basing countries as regards the verification of the agreement <e> <s> there has also been an exchange of letters with the soviet union as regards aspects of the matter which affect that country and ourselves <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord is referring to the possibility of a comprehensive test ban treaty <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will forgive me for saying that that is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not seen the words to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> as i said in my answer we certainly agree that for the foreseeable future the prospect of a nuclear-free world is likely to be elusive <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the heart of the verification aspect of any agreement that cheating should not be possible <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has now replied twice to the points raised <e> <s> we are transgressing very far from what the procedure committee has recommended <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to give the noble lord both the assurances that he has sought <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the partial warmth at least of the reception for what i have been able to propose this evening <e> <s> with regard to the penultimate point being made by the noble lord lord prys-davies about the definition of the word partly he posed some hypothetical situations on which he said he would welcome guidance <e> <s> i shall be very happy to write to him with whatever additional guidance i can <e>", "<cs> my lords my answer referred to firms which have a direct relationship with the ministry of defence <e> <s> there are an infinitely greater number of small firms working as subcontractors to the main systems contractors to the ministry of defence something in excess of <e> <s> as for payment terms applied by main contractors to small firms we have recently invited the main contractors to agree to a code of practice which we shall be putting into some of the terms of our own contracts <e> <s> the main contractors will be required to treat their subcontractors no less favourably than the main contractors are treated by us <e>", "<cs> my lords the small firms initiative to which i referred in my original answer was launched just over a year ago <e> <s> one important feature of that initiative is a small firms advice division which is available to advise small firms on how to understand and operate the contractual arrangements which the ministry of defence has in place <e> <s> at the same time we are looking at ways of simplifying the tendering and contracting procedure particularly where comparatively small sums are involved <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> undoubtedly reflects the considerable knowledge of the noble baroness of educational matters and her understanding of the intended role of the national curriculum council and the curriculum council for wales in establishing and developing the national curriculum <e> <s> however as i shall try to show it is unnecessary in the short term and would have no relevance in the longer term when the curriculum working groups will have done their work <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of my right honourable friends exact intentions in this matter <e> <s> however i shall see whether i can obtain any information and write to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords the proposed amendments to the functions of the national curriculum council and the curriculum council for wales amendments nos <e> <s> and would give the councils a significantly greater degree of formal freedom than we intend <e> <s> the responsibility for promoting and developing the national curriculum properly rests with the secretary of state the leas and the schools <e> <s> the work of the curriculum councils is to provide support and advice in this important endeavour <e> <s> to say this is not to detract in any way from the significance in the scheme of things of the curriculum councils <e> <s> their advice guidance and support will be absolutely vital to the success of the enterprise we are embarked upon <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that clause has been one of the most controversial because it has been one of the least understood elements of our provisions <e> <s> i hope that if i once again explain in some detail the nature and scope of the clause the noble baroness will see that this amendment is unnecessary and will feel able to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments as we now understand have two aims <e> <s> the first is to substitute may for shall in two places in clause and so make the following of clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i am replying not only to amendment no <e> <s> but also to amendment no <e> <s> to which the noble baroness also spoke <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that i had sat down when my noble friend rose nonetheless if i have your lordships permission to speak again perhaps i may say that there is of course nothing to prevent head teachers taking appropriate advice if there is time for them to do so and i dare say that in the kind of circumstances pointed to by my noble friend that is what would happen <e> <s> we want to give them the necessary flexibility and i fear that these amendments would not assist in that desirable aim <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we expect that the national curriculum council will use its discretion to include parents groups in its consultations <e> <s> we also expect that it will wish to include employers organisations and representatives of minority cultures and other relevant interest groups including conceivably the ones referred to by the noble lord <e> <s> the list in clause those whom the national curriculum council is duty bound to consult is not intended to be comprehensive <e> <s> it covers those on whom the national curriculum will impose new duties and responsibilities that is leas governing bodies and teachers who therefore should have a formal right to be consulted <e> <s> but the freedom of the national curriculum council to go beyond those groups is not constrained nor should we want it to be <e> <s> i hope that that will reassure the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is suggesting an extremely sophisticated system such as tgat did not propose <e> <s> indeed the task group considered and rejected her first proposal that results should be adjusted to reflect socio-economic factors on a standard basis on two grounds <e> <s> first no one has yet arrived at a generally accepted formula for calculating the effects of such factors on academic performance and secondly adjusted figures by scaling up the scores of pupils with low attainment in areas of socio-economic deprivation could conceal large numbers of pupils who are under-achievers and could also conceal the need for additional resources to be made available to these schools <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no intention under clause of restricting access to information to those who are able and willing to pay <e> <s> there can be no charge for inspecting any of the information made available under the new regulations and while exact details must be the subject of consultation we should expect that the information would certainly be available in each school and some of it perhaps in other places such as public libraries <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very happy to reflect upon this matter <e> <s> i do so without offering a commitment to my noble friend of any kind but i will ensure that the matter is considered further <e> <s> if there is any amplification or clarification that we think it right to make we shall seek a further opportunity to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we shall certainly do so both in our bilateral contacts with countries in africa and also in multilateral fora such as the united nations <e>", "<cs> my lords i invite the noble lord to look at the cutting in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords we have been supportive of the various initiatives in the united nations which have sought to outlaw and hopefully to put an end to those evil practices <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the history of the united kingdoms opposition to those evil practices as the noble lord rightly calls them is second to none starting as we have been reminded almost years ago <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we are in touch with all relevant organisations and we provide what help we can <e>", "<cs> my lords we have seen the reports to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> however i cannot offer any independent confirmation of them <e> <s> we make appropriate representations on a bilateral and multilateral basis <e>", "<cs> my lords i am reluctant to answer a hypothetical question of the kind which has been put to me by my noble friend <e> <s> however as i said earlier i believe that our reputation will withstand any scrutiny <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is speaking out of order if he does not mind my saying so <e> <s> the procedure committee has made it clear that after the minister has replied another speech is generally not considered appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords in committee my noble friend lady cox as she has said moved a similar amendment to the ones before us which proposed making all special schools eligible for grant-maintained status <e> <s> we put forward clear reasons at the time why we found that proposal unacceptable <e> <s> i am afraid that we find no more compelling the present suggestion that a maintained special school of over pupils should have the right to seek grant-maintained status <e>", "<cs> my lords i start by saying that the government every noble lord who has spoken and the noble baroness are at one in wishing that grant-maintained schools be duly accountable to parents to the wider community and to my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e> <s> indeed such accountability is essential if grant-maintained schools are to carry out responsibly and well the purposes for which they will have been established <e> <s> but i do not accept that these amendments are necessary in order to achieve our purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords i assure the house that there is no dark or sinister motive behind these amendments <e> <s> my noble friend has undertaken to write to the noble lord lord morton and i shall ensure that a copy also goes to the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords with the permission of the house the first position is exactly the one for which the noble lord looks <e> <s> secondly it is not normally the practice as the noble lord will be aware to discuss the detailed advice available to government <e> <s> but the government are satisfied in the light of all available advice that the position is as i have described it <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the intention of the noble baroness that local authorities should not be required to meet the travelling costs of pupils attending grant-maintained schools at some distance from their homes <e> <s> but i suggest that the amendment she proposes is too restrictive and could prove unfair to some families <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may have your lordships permission to speak again no i did not intend to say that <e> <s> i was simply drawing the parallel that in some circumstances local authorities provide for example travel assistance to pupils attending such schools <e> <s> we would not want the discretion of the local authority in that way to be fettered <e>", "<cs> my lords yes that is the intention <e>", "<cs> my lords we discussed at some length in committee the governments policy on charges in relation to music tuition <e> <s> we emphasised then our firm commitment to the place of music education in schools reinforced by the bills provisions and explained the reasons why we consider it appropriate that charges may be levied in respect of individual instrumental music tuition <e> <s> i should stress again that the bill as drafted allows that charges may be made for such tuition it will be for the individual school or lea to decide whether charges are to be made <e>", "<cs> my lords if the tornado is anything to go by the new european fighter will certainly have a considerable export potential <e> <s> as regards the number of jobs that that might create i think it is perhaps fair to say that the production of any export version of the european fighter aircraft is likely to follow the national production <e> <s> therefore it follows that the jobs created by the original decision will be sustained rather than that new ones will be generated <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i recognise the figure referred to by the noble lord <e> <s> what we have agreed to so far is the development phase of this programme <e> <s> the united kingdom share will be of the order of billion or billion <e> <s> the noble lord will be reassured to know that there is a ceiling price agreed on the cost of the development programme <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will i know be grateful to the noble lord lord morton for agreeing to group the amendments in the way that he has <e> <s> i shall deal with them in the order in which they appear on the marshalled list hope that that will be in accordance with your lordships wishes <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble baroness but my noble friend has now replied <e> <s> i believe that the procedures on third reading are that there should not be interventions after the minister has replied <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of extending grant-maintained status to special schools is one which this house and the government have considered on more than one occasion and at some length <e> <s> the government recognise that the present amendments represent a significant shift in approach <e> <s> they would not permit special schools to apply for <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may follow on what the noble baroness has just said <e> <s> of course conversely if we were to follow the logic of her argument there could be a parent with one child who had one vote or a parent with four children who had four votes which some might think equally anomalous <e> <s> however the amendment would require the secretary of state to issue guidelines to assist the governing body in determining any question as to whether a person is a parent of a registered pupil at the school for the purposes of a ballot on grant-maintained status <e>", "<cs> my lords i would reply to the noble lord with this <e> <s> what is the purpose of pressing the amendment if we have given the assurance which covers the point that he has sought <e> <s> a draft of our proposed general guidance on grant-maintained status is already in circulation <e> <s> this will be followed after royal assent by separate more detailed guidance for governing bodies which will focus more closely on the statutory procedures for becoming grant maintained <e> <s> it will set out the governments views as to who is a parent for the purposes of clause and explain the role of the governing body in those exceptional cases where a question is raised about a particular <e>", "<cs> my lords guidance which will cover new detail on that point will be available after royal assent as i explained earlier <e> <s> it will underline and amplify the existing document <e> <s> we have discussed this matter at great length not only at this stage of the bill but more especially at earlier stages <e> <s> the government remain of the view that the amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> i hope that it will not be pressed <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may reassure the noble lord and others who have spoken by saying that of course the bill has not yet completed its passage through parliament <e> <s> a number of changes have been made in the balloting arrangements one at least of which was against the advice of the government <e> <s> that will have to be taken into account in the guidance that is eventually produced <e> <s> of course we do not yet know how the bill will emerge in this respect because amendments that your lordships have agreed to will have to be considered in another place and if they are disagreed to your lordships may have to decide whether you wish to take the matter further <e>", "<cs> my lords if i am misinformed on the matter i apologise to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am talking about the guidelines on grant-maintained status <e> <s> i understand that the guidelines do not yet go into great detail about the ballots because as i have said the final legislative form that the ballot arrangements will take has not yet been finally decided upon <e> <s> parliament has yet to reach a conclusion on all of these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite correct <e> <s> the guidelines to which i have referred do not go into great detail on the question of the ballots for the very reason that i have explained which is that parliament has not yet decided upon the legislative form that those balloting arrangements will take <e>", "<cs> my lords i have explained very carefully the governments view in this matter <e> <s> as regards this provision we believe that it is the views of the parents that should be pre-eminent <e> <s> i believe that in the light of all those considerations noble lords will understand that these amendments are not acceptable to the government <e> <s> i recognise that we have a gap here which i fear is fairly wide and perhaps unbridgeable <e> <s> it is a clear difference of perception between us but am afraid that the governments position is firm <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that that arises particularly on this amendment <e> <s> i think it fair to say however that on educational matters almost every noble lord considers himself to be an expert of one kind or another <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may just begin with a general observation about the basis of grant-maintained status <e> <s> we would not for a moment accept that that is some sort of privileged status because the only privilege which grant-maintained schools will have will be the freedom to run their own affairs and to provide the education which they think best for their children <e> <s> they will not be funded any more generously than they would have been had they <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will refer again to the answer that i gave on the date to which i have referred and for that matter to the defence white paper which we shall be discussing shortly he will see that the military capability of the soviet union is greater than it has ever been in our history <e> <s> who else i wonder would the noble lord have us regard as the enemy <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right that while a number of very welcome sentiments are emerging from the soviet union we shall have to judge them as the noble lord said by what the soviets do rather than by what they say <e> <s> so far we have only words to go by <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that unlike my noble friend <e> <s> my memory does not go back quite that far <e> <s> but i dare say that my noble friend is right <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am not quite sure what gesture the noble lord is referring to <e> <s> but if he is referring to the written answer i mentioned a few moments ago he will see that the position there is not quite as he imagines <e> <s> as i said earlier we warmly welcome the new sentiments emerging from the soviet union and we much look forward to those sentiments being changed into reality <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in total sympathy with the sentiments expressed by the noble lord but one has also to reflect on the fate that befell the afghans the czechs the poles and the hungarians at various moments <e>", "<cs> my lords there can be no doubt about the genuine welcome which the government have given to the words as the noble lord has called them or the sentiments as i have referred to them which have recently emerged from the soviet union <e> <s> however it is a fact that the soviet defence budget for example has declined by not so much as a single penny in the time that mr gorbachev has been in office <e>", "<cs> my lords the united kingdom is not involved in either of the activities to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> however we have warmly welcomed them <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord is well aware the united kingdom is not a formal party to the inf agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that that question is directed to my noble friend <e> <s> however as it falls to me to answer it i should say that a considerable number of things have changed since then <e> <s> for example we no longer have a liberal government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure to which exercise my noble friend refers <e> <s> however i think the purport of the answer which i have given is clear <e>", "<cs> my lords i assure the noble lord that that is not the case now any more than it was the case when a labour government were in office <e>", "<cs> it is about <e>", "<cs> the minister of state my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for interrupting the noble lord <e> <s> i know he would wish to quote the figures correctly <e> <s> it was per cent <e> <s> of the contract value not million as he said <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord said million when he spoke originally <e> <s> i know that he wants to get it right the correct figure is per cent <e> <s> of the contract value <e> <s> that means for every spent <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have explained responsibility for policing the zone rests with the falkland islands government <e> <s> while i have no reason to believe that the present arrangements will not be entirely satisfactory if the falkland islands government wanted further assistance that could be considered <e>", "<cs> my lords the renewable resources assessment group from imperial college which is advising the falkland islands government in this matter is advising also on the number of licences that it is appropriate to issue season by season and has recommended that a slightly smaller number be issued this year as compared with last year <e> <s> i am clear that that results from the groups views on the conservation aspect of the matter with which it is clearly satisfied <e>", "<cs> my lords the main fishing grounds are inside the zone to which i have referred <e> <s> as for the countries concerned in the second season the one which began earlier this year licences were issued which is an increase on to companies from the united kingdom and the falkland islands spain portugal italy greece norway poland japan and south korea <e>", "<cs> my lords the revenue to the falkland islands government for is estimated at million <e> <s> this does not include the joint venture premiums payable by the stanley fisheries company ltd against that must be set the estimated enforcement and scientific costs which are of the region of million for <e> <s> there is clearly a substantial new revenue for the falkland islands government which they did not have before <e> <s> our aid as such to the falkland islands is now at a comparatively low level <e> <s> indeed i think it is zero for this year <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> we do not have military aid as such but as the noble lord will be aware we have a garrison down there which costs something of the order of million <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> this has roughly speaking trebled the income of the falkland islands government which is clearly to be very much welcomed <e> <s> as he may be aware they have commissioned a study on how to take advantage of this new income <e> <s> i understand that the report is to be with them shortly in fact they may <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot agree that this was other than a conservation measure <e> <s> the falklands intermediate conservation zone was established for conservation reasons and for no other <e> <s> that consideration persuaded us that miles was the right limit <e> <s> it encompassed the fishing grounds and had no other significance <e> <s> that is the reason it will be left at that radius for the time being <e>", "<cs> my lords the conservation arguments suggested a limit of miles for this zone <e> <s> it was a conservation zone <e> <s> it was not established for any other purpose <e> <s> it was therefore right to set it at the limit which conservation considerations thought right <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend puts his finger on a very important point already touched on by the noble lord lord shackleton <e> <s> that is why the renewable resources assessment group has been asked to do its work <e> <s> and as i mentioned earlier some million is being spent annually on that work <e>", "<cs> my lords south georgia is certainly not included in this zone <e> <s> there is a convention on the conservation of antarctic marine living resources which covers south georgia waters <e> <s> we are concerned to hear that as is the case not all the conservation measure which that organisation has in mind are being fully met <e> <s> we intend to raise this when the convention meets again in october <e>", "<cs> my lords equally i do not think extending the zone to miles would add to conservation <e> <s> that is why we decided upon the -mile limit <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble lords question is exactly that which i read out a moment ago <e> <s> i should perhaps add that the role of civil servants in respect of public debate on nuclear issues as on any other issues is to advise ministers on the presentation of government policy and that is most certainly a proper role for them <e>", "<cs> i have not heard that particular remark my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not heard that remark from mr scargill but there are quite a number of his remarks that might call for adverse comment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend is right particularly as in this case the film has not been shown as i understand it except on one occasion <e> <s> certainly i have not seen it and i am not sure whether the noble lord lord hatch has done so <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no question of any pressure having been put on the bbc to show or not to show this film <e> <s> the question of whether or not it is to be shown is therefore a matter for the bbc <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said just now unfortunately i have not seen the film and therefore cannot say whether it has any relevance to page of a famous newspaper <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that my noble friend may be quite correct <e> <s> i am not of course responsible for the questions on the order paper only for the answers <e>", "<cs> my lords the role of civil servants is the one that i described a moment ago which is to advise ministers on presentational and other aspects of their policy <e> <s> i do not think i need to go further than that in describing what civil servants should do <e> <s> as for the earlier part of the noble lords supplementary question i do not think that i can be asked to form a view on a film that i have not seen <e>", "<cs> my lords the legislative proposal before congress at the time was intended to do just that to british firms operating in the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i can confirm that the letter concerned represented the view of the british government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not certain off the cuff who saw the letter but i can confirm that as i said it represented the view of the british government <e> <s> certainly the policy which it represented had been agreed by ministers <e>", "<cs> my lords the letter was not sent without the necessary authority <e> <s> as i have said it represented the agreed policy of her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords the issue at stake was not the question of sanctions on south africa but of the right of congress to pass legislation which has effect outside the territorial united states <e> <s> that is a matter upon which the british government have made representations both to the united states administration and the united states congress on a number of occasions in recent years because unhappily such proposals have come forward in various measures proposed in the american congress <e>", "<cs> my lords it is indeed established practice for letters of this kind to be sent <e> <s> in fact it is the way things are done on the hill as it is called in washington <e> <s> representations are made direct to members of congress be they senators or members of the house of representatives <e> <s> it is sometimes done by officials of the embassy sometimes by the ambassador himself and sometimes by ministers themselves in this administration <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in answer to an earlier supplementary question the letter indeed represented agreed government policy <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will be able to read the letter when he visits the library shortly <e> <s> i shall not therefore weary your lordships by reading it out in full but certainly it made reference to the position that would exist were the legislation to be passed <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by adding my thanks to those of other noble lords and those of the noble baroness to my noble friend for raising this matter tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite correct to say that this was a formal document at the very least <e> <s> it is binding therefore upon all those who signed it to ensure that they comply with its terms which include ratification <e> <s> it is dutch ratification that is missing <e>", "<cs> my lords the difficulty with the arrangement proposed by the noble and gallant lord is that it would in the jargon decouple the responsibility for paying the community charge from the responsibility for the provision of the services <e> <s> that has been a fundamental element of the policy right from the start namely that those who pay for the services should also have access to the voting arrangements <e> <s> however i hope that the noble and gallant lord will accept my assurance that we recognise that there are still some anomalies and that we are working to resolve them <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but it is open to service personnel to register to vote where they think fit particularly where they pay the community charge <e> <s> if for example they find themselves in a region where they are paying an excessive community charge it is open to them to get on to the voters list in the region concerned and help to remove the relevant council <e>", "<cs> i do not agree with a word of that my lords <e> <s> the fact is that service people will not be paying more as the noble lord suggests <e> <s> at present a rate element is included in accommodation charges paid by service personnel <e> <s> that will be removed when the community charge arrangements come into force <e> <s> we are very anxious indeed to ensure that the important link between what people pay and the level of local services that they enjoy is maintained <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i cannot be more specific at present final conclusions have not been reached on this matter <e> <s> so far as england and wales are concerned the community charge will not be introduced until april in scotland it will come into effect a year earlier <e> <s> however the anomaly to which the noble and gallant lord pointed undoubtedly exists and we are working to overcome it <e> <s> the range of community charge which gives rise to the anomaly is quite considerable <e> <s> it varies from about per head in orkney to more than in one or two london boroughs <e> <s> i hope that that does not mean we shall have a rash of applications to serve in orkney <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i said that there were a lot of anomalies <e> <s> however i certainly accept that the one to which the noble and gallant lord has pointed is a matter which needs to be considered <e> <s> that is what is happening <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord wishes me to recite a few more difficulties i dare say that with the help of the noble lord opposite i could do so but how accurate that would be i am not certain <e> <s> it might be better if i were to concentrate upon the anomaly pointed out by the noble and gallant lord <e>", "<cs> my lords although it is true that service personnel are frequently posted from one place to another it is not necessarily the case that they would pay the community charge in a variety of different places because if thought fit for the purposes of the charge their official residence can be decided to be in one place <e>", "<cs> my lords if they were posted abroad or away from their principal residence for a considerable period they would cease to be resident in that place and i believe that arrangements would then come into force to ensure that they would not have to pay the community charge in the same way as they would cease to pay rates <e>", "<cs> my lords on the second question of the noble and gallant lord i agree that we certainly need to ensure that the move that we have instituted for some years past from the tail to the teeth continues and is not in any way upset by these new arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not planning to make a statement <e> <s> however i dare say that one of the very numerous senior distinguished and gallant noble lords will ask me if i do not <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of the veracity of the last point although i do not wish to question what the noble lord says <e> <s> i certainly agree that we need to move forward with this matter at the maximum possible speed <e> <s> we shall see that that happens <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that it is the practice of the house to refer to those noble lords who continue to hold five-star rank as noble and gallant <e> <s> that in no way detracts of course from the gallantry of the noble lord himself <e>", "<cs> my lords this is one of the matters that is being discussed between my right honourable friend and the chief minister <e> <s> in the light of the further discussions to which i have referred i hope my noble friend will agree that i should not anticipate how those discussions may turn out <e>", "<cs> my lords these discussions have been continuing for some time as the noble baroness will know <e> <s> they are reaching a very important juncture <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness will forgive me if i do not say anything to anticipate the outcome of the discussions shortly to take place <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot confirm exactly the figure to which my noble friend refers but of course it is the case that a commitment exists however it is also the case that contributions have been made over the years <e> <s> an entitlement to pensions therefore also exists <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall certainly be willing to answer questions on the outcome of these discussions or let the house know in some other way as soon as that outcome is reached <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards generosity we have already contributed the million to which i have referred <e>", "<cs> my lords the important thing in this business as in most others is to ensure that the customer receives what he wants and what he can afford to pay for <e> <s> it is therefore incumbent on our tourist industry to ensure that it provides the value for money to which my noble friend has referred <e>", "<cs> my lords the breakdown of visitors remains broadly as it has been previously namely about per cent <e> <s> of the visitors come on business trips of one kind or another and the remainder are either tourists or family visitors <e> <s> as for the expenditure there is some evidence that tourists especially are spending rather less per head in this country than they used to <e> <s> that is no doubt due to the high cost of some of the facilities that they would otherwise enjoy <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an important function of the tourist authorities to whom we provided no less than million of support during last year <e>", "<cs> my lords when we came into office in unemployment was about to lift off like a rocket because many firms shackled to the trade unions as they were had far too many people on their books <e> <s> if they were to become effective and competitive they needed to slim their workforce <e> <s> that is what they have achieved given the considerable improvement in productivity and production that we are now seeing <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble and learned friend is right as he always is <e> <s> however i always try to be as helpful as possible in the answers that i give <e>", "<cs> my lords no i do not agree with the implications of the question asked by the noble lord <e> <s> there have not been -odd changes as he suggested but six or seven <e> <s> the purpose of those <e>", "<cs> my lords that depends on what one calls changes <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not correct to say that the figures are confined to those who are drawing or who are entitled to draw benefit <e> <s> the figures include people who have for example recently been in receipt of benefit and have perhaps run out of time for one reason or another <e> <s> it is important that the figures show the numbers of people who are out of work who are available for work and who are looking for work <e> <s> we have made the changes to try to reflect those criteria <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble lord has it back to front <e> <s> there is now a great growth in the number of small businesses starting up and employing people that is having a significant and welcome effect on the employment figures whereas the unemployment problems that arose some years ago were by and large the result of larger firms shaking out surplus manpower <e>", "<cs> my lords the welcome fact that unemployment has now fallen for the last months consecutively no less is a result of the wise and sound policies of this administration <e>", "<cs> my lords because it would mean guessing how many of the people in or for that matter in to be more accurate would have been involved in procedures that were in place in <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord says it is the case that there has been some decrease in the numbers involved in employment in manufacturing industry <e> <s> the important point is the number of people who are in work of one kind or another <e> <s> i am not sure which sector of the economy they work in is particularly relevant <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that as regards the manufacturing economy total production has increased recently and so has productivity <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not correct <e> <s> happily unemployment is declining in all the regions of the united kingdom although of course the residual level of unemployment differs from place to place <e> <s> i was imagining that the noble lord lord cledwyn would ask me about the rate of unemployment in for example wales <e> <s> i am happy to say that the improvement in the unemployment position is as marked there as anywhere <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have just said when we came to power british industry found itself with far too many people for the scale of business in which it was involved <e> <s> furthermore it was inhibited as to shaking out the excess not only because of its shackling agreements with the trade unions but also because of the restrictive legislation which was then in force <e> <s> happily neither of those situations now prevails <e> <s> industry has been able to shake out its excess labour <e> <s> sadly there has been a time when many more people than we should have wished have <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so to the noble lord that is a biased point of view which we have often heard from many so-called pressure groups from the other side of the political spectrum <e>", "<cs> my lords i have done my best to give the noble lord the figures that he requires <e> <s> it is important to get the figures which accurately represent the position as i described it a moment or so ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i have to reject all that rubbish <e> <s> the exorbitant prices recently suggested for that site and others are the figment of the imagination of some city analyst no doubt assisted by a personal computer and a souped-up ford sierra <e> <s> they bear no relation to reality <e> <s> they are inflated prices which were i dare say intended to chalk up the price of british aerospace shares <e> <s> happily the british investor on the stock exchange is not gullible <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble lord is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the disquiet on this matter that has been generated i accept that there has been some disquiet is the result of the wholly misinformed comment to which i referred a moment ago <e> <s> i accept that the public accounts committee has also expressed some disquiet <e> <s> i therefore welcome the fact that the comptroller and auditor general will further advise the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for my noble friends support <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the city analyst to whom i referred has already recanted so the second part of the noble lords question does not arise <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly open to the secretary of state for the environment to call in a planning application <e> <s> i understand that no such application has been made in respect of the enfield site but an application was made some time ago in respect of the waltham abbey site which was rejected <e>", "<cs> my lords british aerospace had no reason to believe that then any more than it does now <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly the case that british aerospace was the winner of the competition so far as concerns royal ordnance <e> <s> originally other organisations expressed interest in the end there was a short list of six which was finally reduced to two <e> <s> all of those reduced to two knew the facts of the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords royal ordnance was disposed of as a going concern <e> <s> that therefore included all the royal ordnance sites in operation at the time on the basis of the activity presently being carried on at those sites <e> <s> we did of course have a valuation of the sites on that basis before we disposed of royal ordnance <e> <s> a very senior and respected firm of valuers advised the government and the merchant bankers who were advising us on that matter <e> <s> i remain convinced that we obtained a perfectly proper price when we disposed of royal ordnance <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that that is not the case <e> <s> the comptroller and auditor general is the servant of the public accounts committee and through that committee the house of commons <e> <s> he is frequently called in to advise the pac on various matters and i very much welcome the fact that he has again been so called in on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in answer to an earlier question from the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe the government received advice from a very respected firm of city valuers <e> <s> the firm is called weatherall green smith with whom the noble lord is no doubt familiar <e>", "<cs> my lords the valuation to which i referred was of course primarily concerned with the sites continuing in their existing use <e> <s> it was on that basis that we disposed of royal ordnance <e> <s> however the valuers took into account the possibility of some alternative use in appropriate cases <e>", "<cs> my lords on the contrary it was essential that royal ordnance was made an efficient and competitive business <e> <s> before we put royal ordnance into the private sector it was far from competitive <e> <s> it was singularly failing in world markets and singularly failing to supply the ministry of defence on a cost-effective basis <e> <s> it was the most expensive supplier in the world <e> <s> i am very happy to be able to say that now that it is in the private sector royal ordnance is performing very much better <e>", "<cs> my lords we were well aware of the asset value of royal ordnance on the basis of existing use as i said <e> <s> when we planned to dispose of royal ordnance a couple of years ago by means of a flotation on the stock market the sum that we expected to obtain at that time was about million <e> <s> in the event we got million <e> <s> i think that that is a very satisfactory outcome <e>", "<cs> my lords the bids of the two final bidders were confidential <e> <s> neither was aware of the figure submitted by the other <e> <s> therefore it was not necessary for them to pitch their bids at a particular level as the noble lord suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords for all british aerospace knew gkn might have lodged a bid subject to the approval of its shareholders <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the plant closures are a matter for the company <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the last of the noble lords list of supplementary questions i agree that certain intellectual property rights were transferred to the royal ordnance prior to the privatisation exercise two or three years ago <e> <s> needless to say and i hope it will reassure the noble lord the ministry of defence retained the right of free use of that intellectual property for its own purposes <e> <s> therefore i hope that the concern expressed by the noble lord has been set on one side <e> <s> as for the noble lords earlier questions we consistently made clear that whatever rationalisation was required so far as concerns the royal ordnance it was a matter for the new owners and not for the government <e>", "<cs> my lords neither was i misled nor i hope did i mislead those whom i met on the occasion to which the noble lord has referred <e> <s> as i said in answer to the earlier supplementary question it was never possible for government ministers or the government to give any assurances as to what would or would not happen under the new owners <e> <s> however it was clear from the start that some rationalisation would have to take place because at that time royal ordnance was far from profitable <e>", "<cs> my lords while it is the case that the intellectual property was transferred to royal ordnance for a nominal figure some time before the company was disposed of as i said in answer to an earlier question the company was eventually disposed of for million altogether which of course included the intellectual property <e>", "<cs> my lords there are no particular consequences for the ministry of defence except that i hope we shall obtain better value for money from royal ordnance <e>", "<cs> my lords the assistance to which i have referred today amounts to about per cent <e> <s> of a project costing something like million altogether <e> <s> the earlier project to which my noble friend referred cost million altogether of which the then government provided million representing about per cent <e> <s> of the cost of the whole project <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly the case that the earlier investment to which i referred and which the noble lord will no doubt also recall presumably tempted ford to proceed with this further investment <e> <s> this latter investment has been i believe the result of a team effort both by the official organisations involved the welsh office and the local authority and the trade unions which have persuaded ford that their industrial relations record is such as to justify this further investment <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that the ford motor company like the rest of us operates in the real world <e> <s> in the real world grants or this kind are available not only from places within the united kingdom but also from other places in europe and elsewhere <e> <s> the ford motor company is therefore able to shop around <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly the case that this new investment will lead to a number of important employment opportunities in the area concerned <e> <s> that is very much to be welcomed <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we have calculated that from the government point of view the investment represents a cost of just over per job created <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it is important to point out that the decison that ford has taken in respect of this latest investment very much reflects its confidence in the likely success of the venture in south wales <e> <s> that relates not only to the money which the company will receive from the government in support of the venture but also as i said just now the greatly improved industrial relations atmosphere in that part of the country which has made an important contribution to the decision-making process <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lord is right in saying that the success of the earlier venture has contributed to the ford decision on this occasion <e> <s> having said that there was fierce competition for the ford plant and i am very pleased that the decision has gone the way of south wales <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that production of the engines will begin some time in <e> <s> i am certain that by that time they will be able to run on the unleaded fuel to which the noble lord refers <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to bring to a conclusion todays passage in this excellent debate i should like to start by adding my compliments to my <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to have to tell the noble lord that i received the information by telephone from our embassy in pretoria only a few minutes ago and therefore i do not have any further details <e> <s> however i dare say that such details will emerge in the very near future <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot agree with the noble lord about the general trend which in regard to accidents in the mining industry is downwards <e> <s> i concede that there were two more fatal accidents in the last period than in the previous comparable period <e> <s> any number of fatal accidents is too many <e> <s> but the number is still tiny compared with those experienced in other mining industries around the world <e> <s> we shall try to improve ours still further <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> the unions are consulted at all appropriate stages in this process particularly in the drafting of the legislation to which i have referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that a royal commission is the appropriate way forward <e> <s> but circumstances change working conditions change and the use of modern technology changes and it is therefore right that all aspects of employment should be kept under review <e>", "<cs> my lords the first duty upon the ministry of defence is to get a proper return for the taxpayer from this very valuable site <e> <s> i can assure the <e>", "<cs> my lords the raf museum was associated with one of those who expressed interest in acquiring the site concerned <e> <s> the site itself extends to some acres but i am not sure that the raf museum would wish to have access to the whole of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with my noble friend about the importance of the raf museum <e> <s> that is why the listed buildings on the site which are of raf interest must be preserved in an appropriate way <e> <s> it is also why the local planning authority has made it clear that it will attach considerable importance to the interests of the raf museum <e>", "<cs> my lords i have expressed considerable sympathy as regards the position of the raf museum in this matter <e> <s> the museum was associated with one of the bidders for this site <e> <s> it is therefore perhaps not surprising that the other bidders were concerned that there were commercial interests at stake as regards the amount of information that could be revealed to the raf museum which was clearly one of the parties commercially interested in the whole matter <e> <s> having said that i quite agree that the raf museum is a most important part of our national heritage and in particular of the history of the royal air force as my noble friend suggested <e> <s> the interests of the museum must be taken into account in reaching a conclusion on this matter <e> <s> i can assure your lordships that we shall do just that <e>", "<cs> my lords i have seen the planning brief which is quite an extensive document <e> <s> it is issued by the local planning authority and it gives preliminary indications of the kind of development that the authority considers appropriate for this site <e> <s> that document is publicly available <e> <s> it has already been made available to all the firms which have expressed an interest in acquiring the site <e> <s> that includes the raf museum <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that that is entirely so <e> <s> of course we attach great importance to the raf museum <e> <s> it has been on the site for some considerable time <e> <s> but we also have a duty to the taxpayer to ensure that the site is disposed of in a way that meets the taxpayers interests <e> <s> i was very forcefully reminded of that particular point in a recent celebrated case <e>", "<cs> my lords i am greatly obliged to my noble friend for his kind personal remarks <e> <s> i shall do my best in the future to live up to his high commendation <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is right to point to the difficult issues involved in the verification of a chemical weapons ban <e> <s> speaking for myself i believe that no such verification regime is likely to be effective if it does not include a provision for challenge inspection <e> <s> i believe that that is also the view of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a difficult question <e> <s> as the noble lord will understand although there are a number of allegations about the use of weapons which may be in breach of the convention very few have been proven <e> <s> one of the benefits from the recent paris conference was that more nations have indicated their intention to adhere to the protocol for all its imperfections <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the allegations to which the noble lord has referred <e> <s> i must agree that there is powerful circumstantial evidence to support them <e> <s> however they are denied by the country concerned and i understand that the geneva protocol does not make provision for the type of sanctions which the noble lord has in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his intervention <e> <s> of course it is the case that the united kingdom abandoned its chemical weapons capability many years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the case that we saw some casualties from iraq who it was alleged were suffering from the effects of chemical weapons <e> <s> it is very difficult to be certain in such cases nevertheless as i said in answer to the noble lord lord cledwyn the circumstantial evidence was considerable <e>", "<cs> my lords as i recall it there was no doubt about the cause of the injuries concerned namely the presence of certain chemicals <e> <s> however whether those chemicals came to those people in contravention of the protocol is another matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the difficulty is that the protocol as i have said is a very imperfect instrument for these purposes <e> <s> agreed as it was so long ago in very different circumstances as i understand it it provides only for prohibition of the use of chemical weapons between contracting parties to the protocol <e> <s> it is not clear that that is what happened in this case <e> <s> for example i am not entirely certain that the kurds were contracting parties to the protocol <e> <s> of course that is not to say that we do not deplore the use of chemical weapons wherever it may occur <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for her kind words <e> <s> i believe i am right in saying that the royal navy accompanied more ships than all the other western navies put together <e>", "<cs> my lords as i believe the noble lord will be aware following the ceasefire towards the end of last year we have stopped the arrangement whereby merchant vessels are accompanied by royal navy vessels <e> <s> the royal navy armilla patrol is remaining in the region on independent patrol and will therefore be available to resume its accompaniment role should that prove necessary <e> <s> as regards the minesweepers it has been decided that those presently in the region need not be replaced at the beginning of march when rotation was due in the normal course of events but ships will be earmarked to resume that role should it prove necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have that information in front of me but happily not very often <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> it is indeed the case that no ship accompanied by the royal navy was attacked during that time <e>", "<cs> my lords parliament removed the pay of young workers under from the statutory framework of wages council regulation in <e> <s> the government have no plans to establish any framework of this kind in future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i profoundly disagree with the noble lord <e> <s> a great deal has changed in this century a <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is entirely correct <e> <s> indeed those were the arguments which i deployed in when your lordships were considering the legislation and those arguments commended themselves to the house <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am afraid that i do not agree <e> <s> as my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter just confirmed the principal effect of the wages councils was to secure a lower level of employment among young people and not a higher one <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with my noble friend <e> <s> indeed that was why we passed the legislation in and why we have now made new proposals contained in a consultative document which was issued towards the end of last year <e> <s> perhaps i may add that none of that affects health and safety protection for young people because we closely follow the recommendations of the health and safety commission in those matters <e>", "<cs> my lords that may have something to do with the fact that our unemployment rate is now dropping faster than any other country in the european community <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may be forgiven for saying so i do not believe that the right reverend prelate is right <e> <s> i believe that the abolition of wages councils would be a good thing but i must emphasise that the government have not yet reached a final view on the matter <e> <s> we have issued what is a <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i am right in saying that the cbi is among those who have submitted views following publication of the consultation paper <e> <s> the consultation period ended only last week <e> <s> i am not yet in a position to express the governments view on the outcome of that consultation <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will forgive me if i do not follow him down that line save to say that i profoundly disagree with him <e> <s> wages councils are approaching the end of their useful life <e> <s> that is the view we have expressed in the consultation document <e> <s> we shall now take into account all the other views that have been expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords a much better way to establish appropriate wage levels whether for young people or anyone else is by agreement between the parties concerned and not by imposition from on high by wages councils or any other body <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have expressed their view in the consultation document to which i have referred <e> <s> other people have now made their responses to what we have proposed <e> <s> i dare say that among those responses is one from the noble lord <e> <s> they will all be taken into account and the government will express their view on them in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their response to the statement that i have repeated <e> <s> in answer to the few points that were raised in general acceptance of what i had to say in repeating the statement perhaps i may first say that our task in so far as the implications for mr cooper and the hostages in lebanon are concerned will not be made easier but we shall keep pressing for their release by every appropriate means <e> <s> we have no doubt that our swedish friends who will now look after our interests in tehran will do likewise on our behalf <e> <s> there is no case for delaying or linking the freedom of the hostages and mr cooper to united kingdom-iranian relations but i should be deceiving your lordships if i did not agree as i said earlier that our task will be no easier <e> <s> we want to retain relations with iran in the best way that we can but we had no alternative but to withdraw our mission as i have described <e> <s> we have not formally terminated diplomatic relations with that country <e>", "<cs> my lords our position was a special one because the threat was directed at a british citizen on british soil <e> <s> furthermore without a <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly in violation of the beliefs which i hold dear <e> <s> i am afraid that i am not an expert in moslem beliefs but i should be very surprised if the same were not true there <e>", "<cs> my lords for the moment the issue is very much one generated by the threat to a british person in the united kingdom <e> <s> for that reason clearly the people most directly involved are ourselves <e> <s> but we shall certainly want to exchange views with states particularly those directly affected in the region of the middle east <e> <s> we might take the matter forward in the way which the noble lord lord bonham-carter suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords yes my noble friend is quite right that the concern of the interior ministers which has been referred to relates to the movement of diplomats <e> <s> since we now propose that the two remaining iranian diplomats in this country should leave clearly that consideration does not apply so far <e>", "<cs> my lords yes indeed i can assure the noble baroness that our remaining five diplomats plus one dependant in tehran will be leaving in the next few days <e> <s> we shall provide every necessary facility for that purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords we look to see and secure an improvement in our relations with iran not a descent into the jungle which the noble lord appears to fear <e> <s> but the way forward lies in iranian hands not in ours <e> <s> what we want is to see the iranians meeting their international obligations in particular as said in the statement by renouncing the use of or threat of violence against citizens of other countries <e> <s> if they do that our relations can begin to return to a more normal course <e>", "<cs> my lords we have considerable concerns about the level of the observance of human rights in ethiopia <e> <s> for that reason we intend to raise the matter at the forthcoming meeting in geneva <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has said it is the case that some people including some members of the former royal family have been kept in prison in ethiopia since as long ago as <e> <s> we take every opportunity to represent our concerns on that matter to the ethiopian authorities including representations through our ambassador in addis ababa <e> <s> we very much hope that the authorities will see their way clear to releasing those people at the earliest possible moment <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend raises a very important point <e> <s> we go to great lengths to see that the aid which we give ends up in the hands of the right people <e> <s> in fact it is aid issued not direct to the ethiopian government but more relevantly to the agencies on the ground in ethiopia who we believe are best placed to see that the aid arrives at the right place <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said generally speaking our aid is in the form of food and similar humanitarian supplies <e> <s> i suspect that if aid donors did not provide those things it would not be the case that the ethiopian government would provide that aid as an alternative <e> <s> i am not sure that they see their priorities in the same way as we do <e> <s> therefore if we were to stop providing aid for the purposes which we do i am not clear that the ethiopian government would step in our place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of any specific communication with the soviet union on this matter but i suspect that it sees the situation in very much the same light as we do <e>", "<cs> my lords the genevan human rights body to which i referred and where we intend to raise this matter at its forthcoming session is of the nature as the noble and learned lord will be aware of a standing body which meets on regular occasions more or less every year <e> <s> it is a sub-organ of the united nations and therefore has the authority of the united nations <e> <s> believe i am right in saying that it reports back to the general assembly on a regular basis <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great interest to what has been said tonight by the noble lords and the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i have made it clear that quite a lot of the code represents the statute <e> <s> the noble lord has criticised the fact that the code contains a mixture of statute and recommendations that are not derived directly from the statute <e> <s> clearly in those terms the document is of interest to the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that my right honourable friend has made an historic contribution to the present happy situation as concerns east-west relations <e> <s> i am certain that this contribution will continue not least when mr gorbachev comes to this country later this year and certainly while president bush is the leader of the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot claim and do not suggest that our relationship with <e> <s> the soviet union is now perfect far from it <e> <s> i certainly agree that we are looking for a clear response from the soviet union in connection with the matter to which my noble friend has referred <e>", "<cs> my lords we have recently established a joint study group to suggest ways of further enhancing the close links between our two armed forces within the alliance and giving them greater visibility <e> <s> i shall circulate a list of their first proposals now agreed by ministers in the <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> there is under consideration a plan to enhance air defence around the royal air force station at gfitersloh in west germany which will be jointly manned by united kingdom and west german personnel <e> <s> it will use skyguard radar provided by the germans and millimeter oerlikon guns which your lordships may be interested to know were captured from the argentines <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i can confirm no such thing <e> <s> we certainly agree with our german friends that we must keep our weapons up to date that lance the weapon system to which i think the noble lord is referring will become obsolete in and that there can be no third zero <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that chancellor kohl will be very grateful for the noble lords advice on how to improve his prospects in the forthcoming election in germany <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that the lance system to which i have referred is nothing to do with the inf treaty which related to intermediate range systems and not short range systems <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier the present system the lance system will become obsolete somewhere in the mid-s and therefore needs to be modernised or replaced by that time <e> <s> the reason for this is that the short range systems play an indispensable part in natos flexible response strategy <e>", "<cs> my lords the working party to which i referred is not specifically directed towards nuclear matters but rather to enhancing the close links between our two armed forces within the alliance and to giving them greater visibility <e> <s> as regards publishing the names of those who represent the respective sides on the working party i shall have to give that matter some consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords those of us who occasionally hear low flying jet aircraft have every reason to understand the problems which our german friends are experiencing because of the disturbance such aeroplanes cause <e> <s> nonetheless it is undoubtedly the case that our respective air forces i am including the german air force must train themselves to counter the threats which they could face <e> <s> that i am afraid includes carrying out quite a large amount of low-level flying training <e> <s> however we certainly agree that such training ought to be carried out at minimum disturbance to those concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that the two or three initiatives towards producing a collaborative tank have not so far borne fruit <e> <s> nonetheless we hope very much that the next generation of british army tank which will come after the one we plan to procure in the near future will indeed be a collaborative venture <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> there was no question of the government being involved with my noble friends appointment to the inquiry to which the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all noble lords are familiar with the events of th march last year but i hope the house will bear with me if i give a short account of them once again <e> <s> it is important that our debate tonight should not lose sight of the key issue that on that sunny day in gibraltar dangerous and unscrupulous terrorists were planning a spectacular to use their own terminology an obscene act which would have led to the deaths or injury of a large number of servicemen and civilians <e>", "<cs> my lords the best contribution we can make is in the transfer of redundant facilities to the gibraltarian authorities <e> <s> as my noble friend will be aware we shall be transferring further facilities to them for the most part free of charge <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that the noble lord is correct if he will forgive me for saying so <e> <s> a large number of gibraltarian civilians are employed by the armed forces in gibraltar <e> <s> i fear that some of them may not be required after the force adjustments have taken place <e> <s> however as i say <e> <s> the solution to that problem is in generating new economic activities in gibraltar thus providing the additional employment opportunities which i am sure the noble lord will support <e>", "<cs> my lords no because the change in the force levels in gibraltar is not related to the defence budget it is related to the cost-effective use of our forces generally <e> <s> we believe that there are more important places than gibraltar in which to deploy our soldiers <e>", "<cs> my lords i presume that the noble lord is referring to a report about the representations that have been made to the former american defense secretary published in an american defence magazine <e> <s> no such representations have been received by british ministers from the british chiefs of staff <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that the noble lord is correct in that assertion <e> <s> first the responsibility for the transport of reinforcements rests with each of the allies concerned and thus responsibility for transport across the north atlantic of american reinforcements rests with the united states <e> <s> in any event in recent years there has been a considerable increase in the stocks prepositioned in europe and so the position is nothing like as grim as the noble lord suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole basis of our defence policy is one of deterrence to deter such aggression in the first place <e>", "<cs> my lords i was careful to refer to the former defense secretary who was mr frank carlucci <e> <s> i understand that the next defense secretary has not yet been confirmed <e>", "<cs> my lords i should welcome an approach to greater parity of conventional forces in europe <e> <s> taking tanks for example the present soviet fleet including those of its allies is something like tanks while the western fleet is something like so we have a good way to go yet <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord served with distinction in the ministry of defence some years ago <e> <s> if that was his experience then i have to tell him that things have not changed too much <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that would depend entirely on the scale of the attack <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly regard amnesty internationals accusations about turkey as serious and disturbing <e> <s> however we are encouraged by the turkish government who say that they are investigating amnestys recent list of those alleged to have died in police custody and have taken action against certain of the police personnel responsible <e> <s> we were further encouraged by a turkish embassy press statement in november last year to the effect that the turkish government are making a sincere effort to eradicate torture and to adhere to the european convention on human rights <e> <s> kenyas record generally is very good and stands comparison with any worldwide <e> <s> president moi gave a public commitment to protection of human rights during the prime ministers visit to nairobi in january last year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am bound to agree that the situation in turkey is far from perfect <e> <s> we think that the best way to seek to secure a correction of that situation is by continued representation at appropriate levels frankly from the prime minister downwards <e> <s> that is what has happened in recent months <e> <s> as recently as january this year my right honourable friend the prime minister raised the matter with the turkish defence minister who was then on a visit to london <e> <s> my right honourable and learned friend the foreign secretary has also raised the matter on appropriate occasions as has my right honourable friend the minister of state at the foreign office <e> <s> so there is no shortage of opportunities to raise the matter with our turkish friends and we hope and believe that they will take account of what we say to them and bring matters to an early much improved situation <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will permit me to say so i think that that is a separate matter <e> <s> nonetheless i agree with him that if turkey is to join the european community it must adhere to european standards in this regard <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the figures before me but naturally i shall find them and write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords amnesty international is not an organ of the united nations so i cannot say whether it has taken the steps to which the noble and learned lord refers but we should certainly have no objection if it wanted to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that that is sometimes the best way to proceed in this matter but i believe that we must deal with such situations on a case by case basis and treat them in the way that we believe will best bring about an improvement <e> <s> so on some occasions it is perhaps better to go down a different route from that suggested by the noble viscount <e>", "<cs> my lords it is too early to say precisely <e> <s> however i hope that the revised estimate which will be made towards the end of the year will represent another modest saving on the earlier estimated cost <e> <s> the pattern thus far has shown that as the programme progresses earlier estimates become firmed up <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords supplementary question contains at least three errors if he will forgive me saying so <e> <s> perhaps the most important is his suggestion that the programme represents an eight-fold increase in our present forces <e> <s> it represents no such thing <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact of the matter is that polaris is coming to the end of its useful life <e> <s> if we do not replace it then far from increasing our nuclear capability we shall have none <e>", "<cs> my lords we have never said that we should never agree to including trident in such talks <e> <s> however we are still a long way from that situation <e> <s> when it comes into service even if the per cent <e> <s> reduction referred to by the noble lord has come to pass and that is far from certain trident will still represent a tiny percentage of the strategic nuclear capability of the super powers <e> <s> it represents what we regard as an irreducible minimum if we are to maintain an independent nuclear deterrent <e> <s> one cannot have less than the irreducible minimum <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is suggesting that we should cancel our trident programme the answer is no <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the noble lords intervention <e> <s> the labour party is reassessing its defence policy <e> <s> i hope that it reaches the same conclusion as the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure to what underspend the noble lord refers <e> <s> the defence budget is set to increase steadily in the future by approximately per cent <e> <s> in real terms <e> <s> the precise growth in real terms depends upon future inflation <e> <s> as regards underspend it is the case that we are spending less on defence procurement programmes than we had originally planned <e> <s> that is not because we are reducing the size of the programmes but because we are now securing much better value for money <e> <s> that is releasing funds for other much-needed purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord appears to know exactly how many warheads will be fitted to trident and exactly how many missiles will be in service when the time comes <e> <s> none of that information has yet been announced and in most cases it is highly sensitive and classified <e> <s> i venture to suggest that the noble lord is not yet in possession of it <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend rightly points out that would be an act of the greatest folly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am often interested in the views of the noble lord if he will allow me to say so <e> <s> i am afraid that his last remark bears the hallmarks of inaccuracy which has been a feature of some other suggestions he has made <e>", "<cs> my lords polaris is coming to the end of its life and therefore has to be replaced by something <e> <s> beyond the mid-s polaris will not be a credible deterrent and therefore has to be replaced <e> <s> it was decided that it should be replaced by the best of the submarine-based systems we could acquire which is the trident d system <e>", "<cs> my lords i need notice to answer the last supplementary question put by my noble friend <e> <s> however from the list in front of me i believe i am right in saying that all the ships to which i have referred save nine are being constructed in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords as usual i am afraid that there are one or two misconceptions in the noble lords supplementary question <e> <s> far from vessels being available from the commitment of about the number today is <e>", "<cs> my lords the aviation support ship is a programme for which we have recently invited proposals from a number of shipbuilding firms <e> <s> we look forward to receiving the proposals later this year and to placing an order some time next year <e>", "<cs> my lords they are almost always awarded on the lowest tender <e> <s> but there were one or two cases recently with which i dare say the noble lord will be familiar where that was not so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure what aspect of the united states defence strategy the noble lord is referring to <e> <s> for example the destroyer and frigate force which we are committed to maintain to the size of about vessels as the noble lord will be aware is largely assigned to nato for its purposes in the eastern atlantic <e>", "<cs> my lords generally speaking all the ships manufactured for the royal navy are built in british yards <e> <s> as my noble friend has pointed out many of them are built in scottish yards <e> <s> that is not to say that we do not wish to seek the best value for money in everything that we purchase for the armed forces including the royal navy <e> <s> in appropriate cases we are ready to consider proposals from other yards <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may touch on two points from the list raised by the noble lord <e> <s> first the policy in this matter is a united kingdom government policy which is pronounced by the prime minister or the foreign secretary or whoever else according to the occasion <e> <s> there is therefore no question of the policy being driven by one minister or another as the noble lord suggested <e> <s> as for the question of an assembly point or a point of collection in namibia that is not part of the united nations plan and swapo knows that <e>", "<cs> my lords the number of troops to be deployed under the revised arrangements that were agreed in february of this year is <e> <s> the figure of was an earlier figure which it was subsequently decided was not art appropriate number <e> <s> the number now is of which the united kingdom contribution as the noble lord may be aware will be a signals unit amounting to some plus a small number of air movements experts <e> <s> as for the incursion into northern namibia on st april i am not certain what the motive of the swapo forces involved was but i am clear that their incursion was not in accordance with the united nations plan <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said the present figure is but the contributing countries have made it clear that they will consider sympathetically requests for further forces if that should prove necessary <e> <s> that matter will be for the secretary general to decide in the light of the report that he now has <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the precise figure but with our forces on their way to namibia as i speak including the last contingent of the united kingdom forces it is certainly substantially less than <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that as long ago as there was a suggestion that there should be an assembly point inside namibia but all that was superseded on at least two occasions by subsequent documents and agreements which made other provision <e>", "<cs> my lords president ceausescu is a head of state and not a head of government although he also holds the latter post <e> <s> we are anxious to improve our relations with romania but that would have to be in the context of an improvement in romanias human rights performance <e> <s> we wish to take every opportunity for them to hear our views <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble baroness that we shall lose no opportunity for making our views known to the romanian leadership <e> <s> the csce process is just one of those occasions <e> <s> we have reminded the romanians of their obligations under the final act on more than one occasion <e> <s> the united nations human rights <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> that is a matter which is causing us special concern <e> <s> a number of churches around bucharest were demolished between and but i understand that none has been demolished since <e> <s> we wonder whether that may be the result of international pressure <e> <s> we certainly hope so <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite correct <e> <s> there are about million people of hungarian descent living in part of romania <e> <s> we are anxious about their condition and have also made that point known to our romanian interlocutors <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that one or two western europeans have been allowed to visit parts of transylvania including i understand my noble friend lord newall <e> <s> however generally speaking our diplomats in romania are subject to very considerable restrictions <e>", "<cs> my lords no they have not is the short answer <e> <s> our ambassador tried to visit a romanian citizen recently and as my noble friend has pointed out he was manhandled and subjected to some abuse <e> <s> my right honourable and learned friend the foreign secretary has raised that matter quite recently with the romanian foreign secretary but i am sorry to say has not received a satisfactory reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i shall have to inquire into both those points <e> <s> i do not think that a reciprocal award was made but i shall check <e> <s> as regards the ownership of the collar to which my noble friend refers perhaps i may write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords the survey was carried out by a very reputable company in that field and the work was done on a scientific and proper basis <e>", "<cs> my lords it is abudantly the case that to maintain massive restrictions upon entry to various industrial enterprises by virtue of some requirement to join a union is no way to provide additional employment opportunities <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that loosening the constraints upon the closed shop in one way or another increases employment opportunities for all concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very interesting supplementary question but it does not arise directly from the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am of course a government spokesman in this department and not just a spokesman for individual departments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that the noble lord is a very distinguished practitioner in this field <e> <s> i am sorry that my right honourable friend did not engage his services to produce this particular survey <e> <s> i know that the noble lord has produced some important works on this matter <e> <s> i dare say they were prepared on a different basis <e> <s> however we are quite persuaded that the techniques used to produce these figures which are very comprehensive were the right ones and have produced the right results <e>", "<cs> my lords to be truthful there is no report as such <e> <s> what there is and i have seen it is a very voluminous collection of computer print-outs in the form of figures with the results of the analysis <e> <s> a much more meaningful document will be the article which will appear later this year in the <e>", "<cs> my lords from what i have seen of the accounts of my right honourable friends speech it related to economic policy generally and that is not the matter addressed by this question <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not had a chance to study my right honourable friends speech in detail but if it proposes new employment opportunities in wales then that is much to be welcomed <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> the decision was taken by the united nations authorities in namibia on that day and not by my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason why the united nations plan which was due to come into effect from st april got into such difficulty was because of a major incursion into namibia by members of swapo who had no right to be there <e> <s> however that was in the past and they have now agreed to withdraw into angola north of the appropriate parallel <e> <s> matters are now on track to resume a successful implementation of the united nations plan <e> <s> important duties are laid upon the south africans in accordance with the implementation of the un plan as well as upon swapo <e> <s> we are now looking to all the participants in the united nations process to honour their undertakings and we have evidence that they all intend to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords keeping the peace is not quite the role of the united nations forces and officials in namibia <e> <s> their task is to oversee the implementation of the united nations plan which calls for elections to be undertaken later this year and for an appropriately elected government to come into office in namibia in due course <e> <s> nonetheless it is important for an appropriate number of united nations forces to be in place <e> <s> we are ensuring that they will arrive as quickly as can be arranged and all the united kingdoms contribution is now in place <e>", "<cs> but my lords they are not there and were never intended to be there in the kind of force which the noble lord has in mind <e> <s> it is not the role of the united nations forces to conduct military operations in namibia of the kind that he suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords in recent days we have heard much more helpful utterances from senior officials within swapo including its agreement to withdraw across the border north of the th parallel in southern angola <e> <s> that will mean that the united nations will be back on track <e> <s> i do not put it more strongly than that <e> <s> the united nations plan is far from complete but there are signs that it is now moving in the right direction and i invite your lordships support of that process <e>", "<cs> my lords of course swapo is a very important element in native opinion in namibia and is intimately involved as the right reverend prelate suggests in discussions going on continuously with a view to keeping the united nations process under way and ensuring that a successful conclusion is reached in due course <e> <s> i certainly agree with the right reverend prelate about the importance of the swapo position <e>", "<cs> my lords yes the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> the withdrawal of south african forces to bases will be an important part of this process <e> <s> it is certainly essential that that part takes place and we have reason to believe that the south african forces intend to do just that <e>", "<cs> my lords there are different strands and strains of opinion within swapo as there are within many political groupings if one may say so <e> <s> however the important matter now is that the peace process should continue on track and that duly constituted and properly conducted elections should take place later this year <e>", "<cs> my lords the latest news i have is that the withdrawal is going more or less according to plan <e> <s> naturally communications are not always terribly good between london and the situation on the ground <e> <s> however we have no reason to believe at present that things are not going more or less as we had hoped <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to clarify the position with regard to the last point of the noble lords supplementary question <e> <s> interrogation as it has been somewhat unfortunately described such as it is will be conducted by unctad officials and not by south african security forces personnel and will simply relate to the essential information required to ensure the implementation of the arrangements now in place <e> <s> i agree that it would not be appropriate for south african officials to conduct the kind of interrogation that has been feared <e> <s> i believe that there was an unfortunate remark made in that connection by a member of the south african security forces which gave rise to that misconception <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not entirely certain about the type of reactor involved in the accident to which my noble friend has referred <e> <s> there were press reports to the effect that it was a liquid metal cooled reactor <e> <s> as my noble friend will be aware british reactors are of a different design <e> <s> i am very pleased and proud to be able to say that we have had no significant accident with our nuclear submarines throughout the time they have been in service <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two ranges of tests going on <e> <s> the norwegians are regularly testing the waters in the immediate vicinity of the incident and also the atmosphere <e> <s> likewise we have routine and continuing tests of fish in our own waters <e> <s> i am very happy to be able to say that no evidence of radioactivity has been found so far in either of those tests <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will give way last year we were invited to visit a soviet union chemical weapons establishment <e> <s> we sent a team of experts who were shown virlually nothing <e>", "<cs> my lords earlier today i had the privilege of addressing your lordships on the western alliance <e> <s> it occurs to me not without some help from other quarters of your lordships house that this evening we are considering a very much earlier western alliance which as several noble lords have said goes back some centuries <e>", "<cs> my lords we should have preferred to put on the postal slogan a reference to the peace that has reigned in europe since the end of the second world war <e> <s> unfortunately the post office decided that that was a contentious and controversial proposition and would not authorise it <e>", "<cs> my lords like my noble friend i am mystified at the post offices view but the post office not ministers made the decision in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that if we had followed the policies proposed by noble lords opposite or even by mr gorbachev those years of peace would not have prevailed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that that question arises from the question on the order paper but it is fair to say that the years of peace which have been of so much benefit to the members of nato have been of equal benefit to the people of the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and gallant lord will not expect me to anticipate the statement that is to be made in the not too distant future <e> <s> however i can assure him that all the points he has made are being very carefully taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> the contribution that the gurkhas have made <e>", "<cs> my lords the content of the white paper does not exactly arise from the question on the order paper <e> <s> however if the noble lord is asking why there was no extensive reference to gurkhas in the white paper perhaps i may revert to the reply that i have just given to the noble lord opposite <e> <s> the white paper that has recently been published is the white paper and not that for <e>", "<cs> my lords as is known the british army has some modest recruiting problems at the present time <e> <s> they are indeed no more than modest <e> <s> i do not think that the size of the brigade of gurkhas is a relevant consideration <e> <s> however as i have already said we certainly recognise the importance of the brigade <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a rather more complicated question than perhaps my noble friend realises <e> <s> the cost of employing gurkhas very much depends upon where they are deployed <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give a categoric assurance in the way that my noble friend requests <e> <s> however i can say that i shall be very surprised if that is not the case <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no particular deliberate delay <e> <s> as i said earlier there is no particular urgency either because there are no immediate plans for any change in the size of the gurkha brigade <e> <s> what we are considering is the size of the gurkha brigade post- <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> in the future there will be a brigade of gurkhas within the british army for as far ahead as we can foresee <e>", "<cs> my lords all those possibilities will be considered <e> <s> however we have not reached a final conclusion <e> <s> we shall announce it as soon as we have done so <e>", "<cs> my lords we welcome the fact that servicemen like other members of the community aspire to own their own homes <e> <s> we have taken a number of measures to help them to combine home ownership with the special demands of service life <e> <s> we are examining a number of other ideas including the possibility of setting up a scheme to help servicemen save towards the purchase of a house <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that the noble and gallant lord is right in suggesting that this matter is a key element in the retention affairs <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i can reassure my noble friend on that <e> <s> surplus married quarters are always offered at a discount to the armed forces before they are placed on the general market <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the second of my noble friends supplementary questions yes we always take into account the views of the whole family unit <e> <s> those views are often coincident with the views of the husband <e> <s> as to the retention of skilled personnel the problem of retaining highly skilled people is not confined to the armed forces <e> <s> it is a problem which is manifest right across the british economy within british industry and other organisations as well as the army <e>", "<cs> my lords i am trying to deal with the present situation <e> <s> of course i do not deny that the demographic trough as it is called will become more pronounced in the future and the armed forces will have to compete as vigorously as ever to attract their share of competent young people <e> <s> the provision of appropriate housing will represent one of the elements that we shall have to consider <e> <s> but i remind the noble lord that we have a considerable estate of married quarters which are already available to serving personnel whether they be officers non-commissioned ranks or others and those are very much an attraction to many young people <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord <e> <s> it will be necessary to ensure that the whole range of conditions of service available in the armed forces not just the housing provisions remain as attractive as we can make them if we are to continue to ensure that we recruit our share of the young people whom we shall need <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as i can ascertain the noble lords view is unique to himself <e> <s> the white paper that we published at the beginning of this week has been widely welcomed by a wide spectrum of political opinion <e> <s> i am sorry that that does not include the noble lord <e> <s> in fact at present the strength of the armed forces is close to the planned strength <e> <s> out of a total number of personnel of some taking all the services together overall we are less than short which is a tiny percentage <e>", "<cs> my lords we are doing our best to bring this matter to a speedy conclusion <e> <s> it is in our interests as well as those of our servicemen to ensure that we do that <e> <s> i assure my noble friend that there will be no unnecessary delay <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> that is an important consideration but adds to the complexity of any scheme we have to devise <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to reassure the noble lord that the pay is now rather more than five shillings a day <e>", "<cs> not moved <e>", "<cs> my lords we are currently considering the possibility of relocating the land and air systems controllerates involving some posts from london to somewhere outside <e> <s> we expect to reach a decision on that very shortly <e> <s> a range of further relocation possibilities is also under review <e>", "<cs> yes of course my lords <e> <s> it is essential in any of these relocation considerations to ensure that they remain as effective as ever <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords <e> <s> allowances are presently paid <e> <s> we are concerned to ensure that these meet the necessary expenses which people incur <e> <s> we are therefore reviewing the present package of allowances to see whether it needs to be improved <e>", "<cs> my lords we take great care to discuss these plans at as early a stage as possible with all those directly concerned not least the representatives of the personnel themselves <e> <s> i believe that is the main point which the noble lord was concerned about <e>", "<cs> my lords for very good traditional historical reasons now very much lost in the mists of history a great proportion of ministry of defence establishments are located in the south-east of england <e> <s> the reason i am told was to counter the threat from napoleon many years ago <e> <s> clearly different considerations now apply we are therefore working hard to correct the imbalance that undoubtedly exists <e> <s> the problem is that the cost of moving many of these establishments leaving aside the disruption to the personnel is often considerable <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will be aware the necessary facilities must be set up for the quality assurance directorate <e> <s> quite a range of technical equipment is required to carry out the work some of which will be removed from its present site mostly at woolwich <e> <s> other equipment will be acquired locally <e> <s> all that will i fear take some time so it will be two or three years before the benefits of this change are seen in jobs in the district <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have to take some advice concerning the ratio of the remaining jobs <e> <s> some civilian jobs presently exist in the south-east area represented by the ministry of defence <e> <s> as for the claims of wales for any future relocations cardiff is among the places being considered for the land and air systems controllerate move to which i referred a moment ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with my noble friend about the importance of jordan and the strength of our links with that country <e> <s> we certainly agree too that the solution lies with the international monetary community <e> <s> the imf is planning to assist jordan and discussions are now proceeding to that end <e>", "<cs> my lords his majesty the king of jordan is a frequent visitor to the united kingdom <e> <s> although i am not aware of any immediate plans for him to visit this country i should be surprised if he does not do so again shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of any specific european community programme <e> <s> we are supporting the imfs efforts most vigorously at the present time but there may also be scope for bilateral assistance from others of jordans traditional friends and allies <e>", "<cs> my lords not at all <e>", "<cs> my lords the proportion of women taking part in the scheme to which my noble <e>", "<cs> my lords the arrangements to which i have already referred are of course available to women in the circumstances mentioned by the noble baroness <e> <s> i am not sure that it is necessary to provide additional support over and above that <e> <s> as i said the present scheme appears to be working very well <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i have not in front of me the figures relating to small hotels only but i shall certainly make enquiries and write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the amount of the defence budget in is million <e> <s> the corresponding figure for the last year presided over by our predecessors was approximately million <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend is well aware as regards defence procurement we are now applying a much more commercial approach to our procurement process which i believe has rendered very considerable overall advantages to the armed forces <e> <s> since we have ordered major vessels and combat aircraft for the navy seven regiments of challenger tanks for the army and over aircraft for the royal air force <e>", "<cs> my lords the matter was discussed by your lordships the other day <e> <s> there are one or two areas where the numbers are below the level that we regard as desirable <e> <s> however that is nothing like the problems that would exist if the new labour party defence policy were to come into play <e>", "<cs> my lords that is nothing like the under-funding that will take place if the noble lord and his colleagues come to have responsibility for these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand the labour party defence policy now proposed it provides for no increase in expenditure <e> <s> i cannot imagine how that will meet the commitments about which the noble lord is expressing such concern <e>", "<cs> my lords no i shall confirm no such thing because it is not the case <e>", "<cs> my lords the essential purpose of the armed forces is of course to confront the military threat that we face <e> <s> but the role that my noble friend points to is an important one for the armed forces to be able to fulfil in appropriate circumstances <e> <s> they are certainly very willing to do that when they have the capacity and capability to do so <e> <s> that situation will certainly continue <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that i have no such doubts <e> <s> the trident programme is on course very successfully and frankly at slightly less cost than was originally anticipated <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord and the house that the first trident submarine will put to sea on the day proposed long ago <e>", "<cs> my lords anybody who really imagines that the newly proposed labour party defence policy is credible had better read it <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly do not accept every applicant for enrolment in the armed forces <e> <s> we must be careful to ensure that those that we do enrol are capable after the necessary training of fulfilling the duties that we shall ask them to carry out <e> <s> sometimes we have to take the view that that is not likely with all the applicants <e>", "<cs> my lords the real growth in the defence budget over the period to which i have referred was between one-fifth and one-sixth which is a substantial figure indeed <e> <s> more importantly not only are we increasing the money in real terms as well as in cash terms but we are getting better volume for the money we are spending because of the tauter procurement process <e>", "<cs> my lords that depends on which years one takes and whether one includes or the year before the one to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> the real growth this year for example is between per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords the overall figure for the period between the financial year and the current financial year shows a very small percentage growth rather less i agree than for some of the earlier figures but certainly a growth <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> the cadet forces have a considerable importance and the resources made available to them over the years to which i have referred have grown considerably <e> <s> for the first part of my time in the ministry of defence i was responsible for cadet forces and i fully appreciate their importance which the noble lord has underlined <e>", "<cs> my lords far be it from me to offer explanations as to the attitudes of such persons but i think it is noteworthy that cnd goes to considerable lengths to complain about western policies in almost every area <e> <s> we hear rather less from it about equally disagreeable policies from the other side of the iron curtain <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree with my noble friend <e> <s> our estimate is that the soviet governments stockpile is many times the figure they have confessed to <e> <s> indeed until recently they had not confessed to any <e> <s> we think it very important that the soviet union should join the international efforts to achieve a worldwide and verifiable ban upon these weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to have to say that cnd is among those who get the wool pulled over their eyes by the soviet union rather <e>", "<cs> my lords there have been a number of discussions recently about the soviet attitude towards an international ban on chemical weapons <e> <s> as the noble lord will be aware discussions are going on in geneva on this matter <e> <s> they have been going on for a very long time and have not yet achieved any worthwhile progress <e> <s> we think that the way forward is for all parties to ensure that those talks do now achieve some progress <e> <s> we invite the soviet union to contribute to that end <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that its present posture in being so secretive about its own position is not helping <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend rightly says there was a visit of western experts to shikhany last year <e> <s> there was also a visit of soviet experts to the british establishment at porton down <e> <s> we were quite open with our soviet visitors and answered all the questions that we could <e> <s> the soviets by contrast were very secretive when our experts visited their establishment <e> <s> i would refer my noble friend to the reference to that visit in this years defence white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite correct <e> <s> a part of the establishment which we had detected by means of aerial imagery a point drawn to the attention of our soviet hosts was said to be off limits and a visit to that area was not permitted <e>", "<cs> my lords the allegations of atrocities and other abuses in the region are not confined to those referred to by the noble lord <e> <s> we are encouraging all sides to co-operate with the un special representative the administrator general and of course icrc representatives so that the implementation of the un plan can proceed with all speed <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i deplore any such atrocities as those to which the noble lord has referred if they have taken place <e> <s> i am not saying that they have not but we do not possess the evidence <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that the great majority of the swapo forces have now withdrawn north of the border indeed most of them north of the agreed line which is rather to the north of the border <e> <s> it is also the case that the south african forces have now withdrawn to their bases within namibia <e>", "<cs> my lords yes indeed the icrc is making an important contribution <e> <s> as i understand it its present role is to determine the identity the whereabouts and the well-being of those who have been held in detention on both sides <e> <s> i hope that all parties concerned will give the icrc maximum co-operation in its task <e>", "<cs> my lords the elections are due later this year in november as the noble lord is aware <e> <s> that is a little way off yet but we very much hope that the elections will take place on time <e> <s> we have no reasons to believe that they will not but of course there is a little water to pass under the bridge yet <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said throughout my answers on the matter this afternoon we do not think that that would be the right way forward <e> <s> we believe that the united nations special representative ought to have the maximum support that we can give <e> <s> we are very happy to make the contribution that we have to the forces in namibia in order to help the special representative implement the un plan <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if my original answer was not clear <e> <s> i do not believe that i can help the noble lord further <e>", "<cs> my lords the prime ministers programme included discussions with ministers covering the full range of bilateral topics including uk aid <e> <s> an agreement with congo on investment promotion and protection was signed during the visit <e> <s> we welcome the valuable contribution to our relations with congo which this visit has made <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that the main thrust of the agreement should be as widely known as is appropriate and i shall see what additional arrangements can be made to achieve that end <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that the formula which the french have decided to adopt which no doubt meets their own requirements is necessarily the best in every circumstance <e> <s> we like to target our aid to those countries in greatest need in a way which we think will do the greatest good <e> <s> that is why we have a slightly different approach to these matters than our french friends <e> <s> we have a small aid programme as regards the congo as the noble baroness will be aware <e> <s> but the congo is not among the poorest countries of africa <e> <s> its annual income per head is something in the region of dollars which may not sound very much but is substantially more than in many countries in that part of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords on the last project to which my noble friend referred i believe that that is a matter between the authorities in the congo and the companies concerned <e> <s> i do not believe that her majestys government are specifically involved <e> <s> the discussions which took place in the course of this visit were wide ranging and a number of issues to which my noble friend has referred were touched upon <e> <s> however the important outcome was the signature of the agreement to which i referred earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords we are deeply concerned about the illegal poaching of african elephants for ivory <e> <s> her majestys government have no formal dealings with the authorities in taiwan but your lordships will have heard the good news yesterday from the ec environmental council which has agreed to important new restrictions on the import of ivory into the community <e> <s> my noble friend lord caithness has announced an immediate national ban on the import of all forms of ivory into the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall certainly lose no opportunity to convey informally the necessary messages to the taiwanese but i think that perhaps the most important message will be the ec agreement to which i have referred <e> <s> that will leave everyone outside the ambit of that agreement in no doubt as to our views <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that all these matters will be discussed at the conference later this year to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> the important objective to be achieved now is to put african elephants into what i believe is called appendix i of the conference agreement so that they have the total protection that indian elephants have currently <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for those observations <e> <s> it is the case that the african elephant is undoubtedly an endangered species <e> <s> if something is not done it will in due course disappear altogether <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i replied to that question in my reference to the informal contacts <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend raises an important point <e> <s> when i was in zimbabwe recently i was offered some ivory statuettes which i did not buy because of my rejection of that proposition <e> <s> i was told that the ivory came from a respectable source <e> <s> indeed there are respectable sources of ivory because elephants have to be culled from time to time not least in zimbabwe as my noble friend indicated <e> <s> however the essence of the problem is that the african elephant is undoubtedly a threatened and endangered species and something must be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the taiwanese authorities will be in no doubt as to the view of the united kingdom government and indeed the people of the united kingdom on this matter <e> <s> they now have the view of the people of the european community as well and it is up to them to take the right action <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much hope that the position of the united kingdom in this matter is clear beyond peradventure <e> <s> recent utterances from mr menem have suggested to the contrary but i hope that he will take care to study what we have said in the past and what our position is now <e>", "<cs> my lords the most recent statement that i have seen from mr menem it is to be remembered that he does not take office until later this year indicated that he wished to discuss the sovereignty of the falkland islands with the british government forthwith <e> <s> the sovereignty of the falkland islands is not available for discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly the case that the economic position in the argentine is clearly very bad <e> <s> i hope it will improve <e> <s> as for its present capacity that is not a matter upon which i would be able to offer a detailed or definitive comment <e> <s> i would think it very unlikely that argentina has the capability to mount much more than some annoyance at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords if i found colonel gaddafi offering me some support in a venture i would take real care <e>", "<cs> my lords there was i think a report issued in march of this year by the ilo committee of experts recording six points where it criticised the united kingdoms employment legislation <e> <s> i should say that the united kingdom does not accept any of those criticisms certainly not at first sight <e> <s> indeed at least one of the six points is not even part of the united kingdom law at present <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will forgive me if i suggest that that proposal goes rather wide of the question to which i am replying <e> <s> as i say the ilo committee of experts has recorded six criticisms and it is those to which we shall respond in the forums to which i referred in the main answer <e>", "<cs> my lords given the fact that we find great difficulty with the position which the ilos committee of experts has adopted on the six points i hope that the noble baroness will agree that her conclusion does not therefore arise <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it it is a committee of experts appointed by the ilo <e> <s> however i do not know the names of individual members <e> <s> but rather than criticise the personalities involved we should prefer to take their criticisms on their merits and respond accordingly <e>", "<cs> my lords those of us who experienced difficulties in getting to work yesterday will i am certain agree with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords we never said that we praised all the work of the committee of experts <e> <s> as i said the criticisms which it levelled at us have caused us considerable difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as we can ascertain the soviet defence budget has been reduced by not so much as a single rouble since mr gorbachev took power <e>", "<cs> my lords unfortunately the soviet union does not announce its new orders in the way in which we do <e> <s> of course it is true that the submarines to which i have referred were for the most part ordered before mr gorbachev came to power but it would have been open to him to cancel them <e>", "<cs> my lords surely what matters is the number of submarines that rolled down the slipways during the period in question <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i agree that the objective now must be balanced and verifiable measures of arms control in all the areas where we can secure such agreements <e> <s> it is perhaps worth noting that as a result of the salt agreement for example the soviet union has been required to decommission two strategic missile-carrying submarines <e> <s> i understand that it has converted those submarines to another equally offensive role <e>", "<cs> my lords the soviet union has long maintained that all its armed forces are there for defensive purposes only <e> <s> that is impossible to square with the scale of the forces which it has maintained <e> <s> however having said that mr gorbachev has undoubtedly brought a new era into the soviet union <e> <s> let us hope that things will be different in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords we are maintaining our pressure on the soviets to come to the kind of balanced and verifiable agreements to which i have referred <e> <s> one has to be fair there is some sign that unlike their stance in the past the soviets are now more ready than they once were to come to such agreements <e>", "<cs> my lords i think perhaps the clearest exposition of the position in this matter is the passage in the defence white paper which i am sure that my noble friend has seen <e> <s> so far as a wider audience is concerned we have produced a document called <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right to point out that the warsaw pact tank fleet numbers something like while the nato tank fleet numbers approximately <e> <s> clearly the recent reductions in the soviet and warsaw pact tank fleet to which he referred are but a fleabite compared with the whole fleet <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that we make any contribution to the successful prosecution of arms control negotiations which of course we very much hope for by distorting or concealing the true picture <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that the soviet preponderance in conventional forces of all kinds particularly main battle tanks which are the subject of my noble friends question is considerable <e> <s> clearly we need to address that enormous soviet preponderance if we are to achieve balance and verifiable measures of arms control <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> we have made clear that we very much support the nato proposals in respect of conventional arms control measures <e> <s> we shall do our best to see that progress is made in that area and shall support all the proposals being made in the vienna forum to which the noble lord referred <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord mr gorbachev has said a great many things but done rather less <e> <s> we now hope that the proposals which he has made can be turned into firm proposals which we can accept <e> <s> we shall hasten to deliver our side of the bargain <e>", "<cs> my lords as i was able to point out to your lordships the other day in answer to a similar question soviet production of tanks to take todays question has not changed by so much as a single jot since mr gorbachev came to power <e> <s> the noble lord might be interested to know that the soviets still have five tank factories all operating at the usual rates <e>", "<cs> my lords until two years ago the soviet union disclaimed any ownership of chemical weapons <e> <s> more recently they have admitted i think to some tonnes of chemical and biological warfare agents <e> <s> we assess that they have many times that quantity <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord refers to his hopes for the future which i share <e> <s> what i must do is point out the present situation which i am afraid represents no change from that which we have seen for a number of years past <e> <s> if progress is now to be made we warmly welcome it and shall hasten to play our part <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble lord has been misled by some of the propaganda <e> <s> the number of tank reductions is i think about or and that clearly makes little impact on the that the soviets possess <e>", "<cs> my lords last year the fourth year of mr gobachevs period in office soviet tank production was as i have said some <e> <s> nato tank production was about <e> <s> in other words soviet tank production was about four and a half times that of the west <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures come from a variety of sources <e>", "<cs> my lords we are looking the facts in the face if the noble lord will forgive me for saying so <e> <s> i certainly recognise that there is a much better atmosphere in the arms control fora with <e>", "<cs> my lords before i bring together the strings of the debate i should speak to the two orders in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise that that is the view of the noble lord <e> <s> he certainly said that he thought that we were spending too little to meet the commitments at least those that we had accepted <e> <s> i do not accept that for a moment but i think i am entitled to say that the noble lords policy yet to be approved by the labour party conference i recognise calls for a freeze on defence spending as i understand it <e> <s> perhaps that will change when a policy emerges from the conference later this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i noticed the noble lords words specifically and i think that he said that we were spending too much <e> <s> however i recognise that he wishes to qualify that in the way in which he described <e> <s> the fact is that however one defines it the noble lord apparently takes the view that too much money is being spent on defence purposes anyway in relation to our national wealth <e> <s> i do not think that that view is very widely shared in your lordships house but i hear what the noble lord has to say on it <e>", "<cs> my lords we are talking of the shorter range system not the airborne systems <e> <s> the current lance system is the existing short-range system as the noble lord is aware <e> <s> it is that capability in which we reject the third zero <e> <s> that is why we have to ensure that lance itself is modernised or replaced towards the middle of the next decade <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the house of commons defence committee will be slow in coming forward with its views on this matter as it already has as the noble lord said <e> <s> it is a highly technical matter <e> <s> it is one to which i have given a great deal of consideration during the past year or so <e> <s> we are taking all the advice that we can <e> <s> we shall reach a decision as soon as we reasonably can and announce it in the normal way <e>", "<cs> my lords that is under discussion within the ministry

lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will forgive me if i do not embark upon a discourse on the paris summit <e> <s> however it is important that such afforestation schemes are each judged on their merits <e> <s> they do not all necessarily generate the bad effects to which the noble lord has referred <e> <s> it is important that that should be done in close consultation with all concerned and in particular in accordance with the various guidelines issued by the forestry commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall look into the latter point to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> as regards the wider question about forestry policy in wales as compared with that in other parts of the united kingdom circumstances are very different in the principality <e> <s> far greater areas of land are available there for the purpose and in many cases a different policy is therefore appropriate <e> <s> it is important that the views of the forestry commission should be taken on the matter <e> <s> it is the expert and it has published a number of documents in order to help those concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> all the schemes to which i have referred and which were referred to in the original question tabled by the noble lord require planting consent in general terms <e> <s> that is granted only after wide-ranging consultation <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is right to draw a distinction between the two types <e> <s> in some parts of the country broadleaf planting is more appropriate than conifer planting <e> <s> however that does not apply in every area <e> <s> for example in some of the upland areas broadleaved trees do not grow satisfactorily <e> <s> as regards the position of my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer my noble friend will know that there is now a move towards grant-aiding such schemes rather than providing them with the tax relief that they have received in the past and which some would say has been subject to some abuse <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord rightly indicates this is a complex technical matter <e> <s> certainly it is not the case that everyone agrees that the planting of trees contributes towards the acidification of rivers and other water areas <e> <s> the matter is now being actively considered by the relevant experts including the welsh water authority and the forestry commission which are now conducting research into the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that afforestation policy particularly in the principality to which the question applies is best taken forward by means of the policy announced by my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e> <s> essentially it is one of considering each case on its merits <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble and learned friends intervention simply indicates and confirms that there are two sides to every question <e> <s> the scientific effect to which my noble and learned friend refers is correct but so are some of the effects to which other noble lords have also referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the answer to that is that it is undoubtedly right to plant conifers in some cases but not in every case <e> <s> broadleaved species as my noble friend lord eden mentioned are sometimes more appropriate and should be supported in those cases <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend speaks from great knowledge and experience of these matters <e> <s> i am tempted to think that his initial observation suggests that fish prefer the broadleaved species <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords <e> <s> in reply to the noble lord lord cledwyn i believe i can assure him that there is no prospect of him becoming an irishman as a result of the bill <e> <s> i hope he will find that reassuring <e> <s> i can also answer the noble lord lord kennet in the affirmative <e> <s> i am grateful to both noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i have it in command from her majesty the queen to acquaint the house that her majesty having been informed of the purport of the continental shelf bill has consented to place her prerogative and interests so far as they are affected by the bill at the disposal of parliament for the purposes of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the allowances package to which the noble lord referred which was announced by my right honourable friend in may of last year was as they say exchequer neutral that is to say while some of the allowances were reduced others were increased <e> <s> moreover although there was some apprehension at the reduction of some of the allowances as the noble lord rightly said there was considerable jubilation at the increase of others <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite correct a contented army is certainly a much better army <e> <s> we think that this allowances package has made a number of important improvements which i hope will become apparent to the armed forces in the fullness of time <e> <s> of course salaries are a different matter <e> <s> we shall in the near future be receiving the next report of the armed forces pay review body <e>", "<cs>

noble lord for his kind remarks as i thank my noble friend also <e> <s> as i said in the original answer we are not privatising the service but are just placing into commercial hands the delivery of

only been going in its new form since the beginning of june <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord will agree that it is a little early to draw conclusions about its success <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite certain that my noble friend is right <e> <s> the original service did not fully meet the needs of exporters <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble lord will forgive me if i say that that is a different question <e> <s> however if i may transgress the procedures of the house i should say that i am aware of the matter the noble lord has referred to <e> <s> we shall certainly be replying to that matter as soon as we can <e>", "<cs> my lords i think this is a slightly different service to the one the noble earl used to take advantage of <e> <s> this service provides information to potential exporters about commercial opportunities in the countries concerned <e> <s> this information now has to be delivered on a very timely and effective basis if exporters are to have a chance to take advantage of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the service does a great deal of good particularly if the information is delivered effectively and in a timely fashion <e> <s> the performance of our exporters generally has been very good in recent years <e> <s> we are of course competing in a world where everyone else is trying very hard as well and we shall have to ensure that we do even better <e> <s> that is now one of my responsibilities <e>", "<cs> my lords the proof of this pudding is in the eating <e> <s> i have just been appointed the minister responsible for these matters <e> <s> i apologise for the fact that i have only been in office hours and i shall try and do better at once <e>", "<cs> my lords it is intended to make some changes to the collation of information <e> <s> at the moment that is done entirely by means of code matching that is matching the requirement to the customs designation of the product concerned <e> <s> now we tend to add key word searching as it is known in the vernacular to the system to produce this information <e> <s> i hope that that will further add to its benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly support the efforts of the egyptians to clarify the israeli proposals with regard to elections in the occupied territories <e> <s> we hope that israel will respond constructively to what the egyptians have suggested <e> <s> i of course agree that the situation in the lebanon has been terrible for a very long time <e> <s> that is why we warmly endorse the ceasefire which happily appears to be holding in the city of beirut and why we also very much hope that the meeting of the lebanese parliamentarians in saudi arabia to which the noble lord referred will bear some fruit <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly hope that all reasonable pressure will be brought to bear upon the israelis to meet the spirit of the egyptian proposals which are as i say to flesh out the proposals which the israelis themselves have made with regard to elections in the occupied territories <e> <s> it is well known that the united states has considerable influence with the israelis <e> <s> however i suspect that that is not total influence <e> <s> the israelis have often been hard to persuade even by the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords the affairs of lebanon are certainly bedevilled by an intervention from the syrians but also by an intervention from the israelis <e> <s> we believe that all foreign troops should leave lebanon and we hope that that will happen soon <e> <s> we very much support the committee of three as it is called which seeks to solve the problems of that unhappy country <e> <s> we hope that those efforts will bear fruit <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is important to realise that the situations in namibia on the one hand and in israel and lebanon on the other are very different <e> <s> there was and is a united nations plan for resolving the problems of namibia which is now being implemented

foreign secretary is one of the committee of three to whom i referred <e> <s> we hope very much that the efforts of that committee will bear fruit <e> <s> they include the head of morocco and the president of algeria <e> <s> we hope that the result will be a solution to this unhappy problem <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as concerns the first part of the noble lords supplementary question the government have decided that vesting the industry on st january as previously planned would require additional transitional arrangements which would have introduced added complexity to the task and made it more difficult for us to meet our objective <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> one of the great benefits of the new system will be the injection of a major degree of competition and hence of choice for the consumer which can only be to his advantage <e>", "<cs> my lords nothing that my right honourable friend has recently discussed will in any way depart from the fact that following the privatisation arrangements customers requiring in excess of one megawatt will be able to put their requirements out to competitive tender immediately <e> <s> i believe that that will be of great benefit to them <e> <s> later on there will be arrangements for smaller customers to put their requirements out to tender <e> <s> furthermore the area boards will also be able to put their requirements out to competitive bidding straightaway <e>", "<cs> my lords all the history of this matter and related matters shows that once one <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that what i have just referred to in any way justifies the words of the noble lord <e> <s> the supply and distribution of electricity will be greatly enhanced by the arrangements that we have proposed <e>

flotations to which i have referred have yet to be finalised <e> <s> i dare say that the fears that the noble lord has in mind will not come to pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that fear forms no part in our decision-making process <e>", "<cs> my lords it will be none of the things that the noble lord suggests <e> <s> it will be highly beneficial not least to the consumer <e> <s> as for the timetable the commitment which we entered into long ago and which remains firm is that we shall complete the privatisation of the electricity supply industry within this parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords it is never our intention to use scotsmen as guinea-pigs for anything <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that the great benefits that will flow from the measure in england and wales will apply equally to scotland <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> as i said when these arrangements first come into place consumers of one megawatt or more will be able to put their requirements out to tender immediately <e> <s> it is intended that smaller consumers should be brought into the arrangements as time passes <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may deal with the last of the supplementary questions put by <e>", "<cs> my lords i endeavoured to answer a number of the noble lords supplementary questions <e> <s> shall i deal with the one about the magnox reactors which he included in his second tranche and also in his earlier tranche <e> <s> the magnox stations are of course the oldest of our nuclear power generating facilities <e> <s> they are all reaching the end of their useful life <e> <s> the costs of decommissioning those systems and of taking them out of service will be very substantial indeed and would have the effect of increasing the price of electricity to the consumer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to have to say that i have not yet seen the right reverend prelates report but i shall take an early opportunity to look at it <e> <s> i doubt equally whether the noble lord has yet seen the report of the secretary-general of the united nations which was published very recently and in which he stated <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i am right in saying that the numbers of police personnel in namibia under the aegis of the united nations is rather larger than the right reverend prelate has suggested but it may be that they have been increased since he was in the country <e> <s> we certainly fully support the activities of the secretary-general and his special representative in namibia and we shall continue to give careful consideration to any request that he may make <e>", "<cs> my lords koevoet is part of the security forces under south african control which have maintained law and order in namibia up to now <e> <s> perhaps i may add to what i said to the right reverend prelate a moment ago <e> <s> i understand that there are now about police in namibia and that the number is being increased to <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the right reverend prelate <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord takes an unduly gloomy view of the situation <e> <s> we certainly believe that the forces should be demobilised and then disbanded <e> <s> so does the united nations and it is seeking to achieve that i believe with considerable success <e> <s> it is true that the united nations transitional advisory group untag to which many noble lords referred was slightly reduced in numbers so far as concerns soldiers <e> <s> on the other hand the numbers of police have been increased <e> <s> both of those changes were at the specific request of the un secretary-general <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever may be the translation of koevoets name we agree that it no longer has a role in namibia <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that any intimidation would be wholly counterproductive and inappropriate <e> <s> so do the secretary general and his special representative <e> <s> it is they who now have the responsibility for bringing namibia to independence first through the election that is to take place next month <e> <s> i believe that our role is best played by giving the secretary general every possible support <e> <s> we shall continue to do that and certainly make our views known about any inappropriate activities of remaining south african personnel <e>", "<cs> my lords namibia is now moving into an election and i hope to independence and will then take its place in the world community <e> <s> it is doing so with the support of all the parties concerned including south africa <e> <s> i do not believe that that process is assisted by the kind of pejorative words used by the noble lord <e> <s> of course we deplore violence and intimidation from whichever side it may come <e> <s> we want to see that process succeed and not fail <e> <s> thus as i said we shall support the united nations secretary general <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that my noble friend will have to address his question to the spanish postal authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very sorry to hear that news from my noble and learned friend <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that the united kingdom postal service for all its faults is one of the best in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that rapid and effective postal services will be very desirable as we come to the completion of the single european market even more desirable than they are now <e> <s> unfortunately the solution to the problem does not rest wholly in the hands of the british authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i tried that last year and received copious complaints about the wrong stamps <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord may be aware there is the international postal union <e> <s> however the principal forum for discussing the necessary improvements in quality of service has been the bilateral forum <e> <s> i referred to two areas in which some progress had been made <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not short of european institutions of a variety of kinds <e> <s> however if the commission wants to examine this matter it is at liberty to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to an earlier supplementary question i referred to the international postal union which is certainly a body with much wider concerns than simply europe and which so far as i know includes our australian friends <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of any such proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords the responsibility for maintaining the standard of service rests with the post office and not with the government as i said in my initial answer <e> <s> the post office is clearly determined to improve the standard of service which i think everyone agrees in some areas at least is not good enough <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have no plans to issue such a consultation document <e> <s> the intention to set up a single new body in wales to undertake the present functions and responsibilities of the nature conservancy council and the countryside commission was announced on th july <e> <s> full and detailed consultations on implementation of this decision are already taking place between the government departments and statutory agencies involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the new arrangements will be more effective in coping with the proper concerns of the noble baroness rather than less so <e> <s> indeed that view was broadly accepted by the principal parties concerned who called upon my honourable friend the minister of state in the welsh office quite recently and had what i am told was a very frank and satisfactory meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that there will be any diminution in the united kingdom contribution to the proper discussion of these matters <e> <s> up to now of course it has not always involved the bodies that have existed under the old arrangements <e> <s> for example government departments attend by and large the principal international forums in these matters and those arrangements will continue <e>", "<cs> my lords working parties are at present devising the arrangements to meet the circumstances to which the noble lord has referred <e> <s> on the question of resources i agree that it is important that these bodies are adequately resourced so that for example they retain the necessary high quality staff <e> <s> the government will ensure that that is so <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot do so without notice <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that the best way forward in these matters is to have a supra-national body if i may call it that <e> <s> the considerations that apply in wales compared with scotland for example are often very different <e> <s> in any event even the old body did not cover northern ireland <e> <s> the principle is therefore by no means established <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not quite hear what the noble baroness said <e> <s> however i can assure her that the new arrangements will be at least as effective as the old ones if not more so and in particular that the arrangements in wales will be very satisfactory indeed as was confirmed by the parties concerned when they called upon my honourable friend recently <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only repeat that the principal voices when they called upon my honourable friend were not of that opinion <e> <s> indeed one of the bodies represented was one of the bodies with which the noble baroness is connected <e>", "<cs> my lords my briefing today comes from the welsh office <e> <s> i dare say therefore that it will be my right honourable friend the secretary of state for wales <e>", "<cs> my lords british telecom has been revising its low-user rental rebates <e> <s> it has recently made further improvements to the scheme which i am pleased to be able to say will especially help the disabled and elderly <e>", "<cs> my lords the calculation is not as simple as the noble lord may imagine but i do not criticise him for that <e> <s> since privatisation there has been a reduction in the prices which are controlled under british telecoms licence of about per cent <e> <s> in real terms <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer is not embarrassing to the government but is rather difficult to arrive at in precise terms <e> <s> bt is allowed different rates of increases for different services and <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards bts latest proposals the unit charge which falls within the rpi minus per cent <e> <s> formula agreed with the director general of telecommunications remains the same but there will be a small increase due to a shorter time allowance <e> <s> other charges within the same bracket will be treated differently so again the calculation is not straightforward <e> <s> needless to say all the charges have been agreed with the director general <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not for one moment suggest that my noble and learned friends question is meaningless <e> <s> however given the wording it is difficult to arrive at a precise answer <e> <s> since privatisation the charges to residential customers have been reduced by about per cent <e> <s> in real terms and that is of considerable benefit to them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is correct mercurys charges for long-distance calls are significantly cheaper <e> <s> my department makes substantial use of the facilities provided by mercury simply because of the better value for money that they represent <e> <s> indeed i have a mercury telephone on my desk <e>", "<cs> my lords we have established a know-how fund for poland to help provide the skills needed to run a fully democratic system and a market-based economy <e> <s> through the european community we are helping to supply free food and to fund projects in the agricultural training and environmental fields <e> <s> international financial help will become available when poland h as agreed a reform and adjustment programme with the imf <e>", "<cs> my lords the know-how fund to which i have referred will represent million over five years and the cost of community food supplies is already over million ecus which is equivalent to about million <e> <s> in addition community project assistance which is aggregated with that for hungary is valued at about million ecus which is about million <e>", "<cs> my lords regarding rescheduling the debt it is important for the poles to agree with the imf on a programme <e> <s> i understand that the views of the polish government and the imf are close on this matter and that therefore a programme is likely to be agreed in the not too distant future <e> <s> it will then be possible for the polish debt situation generally which the noble lord will be aware is considerable to be considered carefully in the so-called paris club <e> <s> we shall be anxious to play a full part in that <e> <s> indeed once the imf programme is in place and the paris club has done its work that will open the way to substantial support for poland in a variety of ways and we shall be anxious to play our part <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i believe we shall <e> <s> the sum of money to which i referred is the amount that has been agreed so far with the european community <e> <s> i am certain that the community will hasten to agree further supplies as and when they prove to be necessary <e> <s> i must agree with the noble lord that that seems likely to be a little while ahead yet <e>", "<cs> my lords if we were to delay unduly the provision of the food aid to which i have referred we would further exacerbate the serious problems that already exist in that country where there are acute food shortages <e> <s> we attach great importance to improving the competence of the polish agricultural sector and indeed of other sectors <e> <s> that is why we attach such importance to the million of know-how assistance that we are providing which i hope the noble lord will agree will contribute to a solution to the problems in that country <e>", "<cs> my lords we do support such provision was provided to the food and agriculture organisation in june and to unicef in december <e> <s> in addition since we have given million for displaced people mainly cambodian on the thai border <e> <s> more than half of this went through un agencies <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that the situation in cambodia is very bad <e> <s> however a little light is now appearing at the end of the tunnel <e> <s> we have been told that the vietnamese soldiers have withdrawn but we would have preferred to see that verified by international observers <e> <s> considerable discussion is going on as to the future <e> <s> for example there was a conference held in paris during july and august which unhappily did not reach a conclusion at that time <e> <s> we hope that the conference will be reconvened in due course and will reach a conclusion <e> <s> we certainly agree that the influence of the evil pol pot as the noble lord referred to him was a very grave matter indeed <e> <s> we do not believe that he has any place in a reconstituted cambodia <e>", "<cs> my lords we have made it absolutely plain that the aid we can provide is not for the benefit of the khmer rouge <e> <s> indeed we have received assurances from the united nations agencies through which principally we have channelled our aid that none of it is getting into those hands <e> <s> i quite agree with the noble baroness that the khmer rouge and pol pot have no sensible part to play in the future of cambodia <e> <s> we should like to see the cambodian people choose for themselves the government that they wish to rule over them <e> <s> if and when that government emerges it will have our support <e>", "<cs> my lords the right way forward in this matter is for the united nations to take the lead <e> <s> we shall give them every support <e> <s> prince sihanouk is involved in the discussions and we also support what he is doing <e>", "<cs> my lords the government in cambodia is not as the noble baroness said a coalition government <e> <s> i am not surprised that she is confused on the matter because i was until i received the benefit of my advice this morning <e> <s> it is a complicated issue <e> <s> the government in power in cambodia at the present time was originally put in place by the vietnamese when they invaded the country some years ago <e> <s> i would not go so far as to say that this government are still a tool of the vietnamese but they were certainly put in place by the vietnamese all those years ago <e> <s> the representation at the united nations is not the representation appointed by that government but comes from the coalition to which the noble baroness referred <e> <s> it is a matter for conjecture as to how representative it is of the cambodian people <e> <s> it is perhaps not for us to challenge the work of the united nations credentials committee which authorised that particular representation <e>", "<cs> my lords we have consistently played a key role including at the peace conference in paris earlier this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether any representations that we made on that particular matter would have the effect for which the noble baroness hopes <e> <s> we want to see the people of cambodia choose a government of their own preference and then to send their duly selected representative to the united nations <e> <s> in the meantime we may have to live with some inconsistencies which i agree are wholly undesirable <e> <s> however the main objective is quite clear <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble lord will understand if i have to be rather guarded in my answers because it may be that a solution proposed by ferranti will come before my right honourable friend the secretary of state for consideration <e> <s> he has a specific role as regards the monopolies and mergers commission <e> <s> these are matters for the company <e> <s> when it has decided on the course that it wishes to follow it will then be for the director general of fair trading to advise my right honourable friend if he thinks fit <e>", "<cs> my lords ferranti in the past has made and now is making an important contribution to our defence capability <e> <s> i very much hope that it will continue to do so <e> <s> clearly the company has entered into a period of some difficulty and it is for ferranti to bring forward solutions to those problems <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole basis of our defence procurement policy these days is one of competition rather than the issuing of contracts to preferred suppliers as was the system in olden times <e> <s> i believe that the new system is infinitely preferable to the old one <e> <s> the result is that in almost all major areas of defence procurement we now have more than one preferred supplier <e>", "<cs> my lords the success or otherwise of ferranti lies in the hands of the management of that company not in the hands of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is entirely correct <e> <s> that is perhaps the principal difference between members on this side of the house and noble lords opposite <e> <s> we no longer seek to spoon feed our industries <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact of the matter is that we already acquire some of our defence equipment from companies which are not united kingdom-owned <e> <s> for example a year or so ago we placed an order with the boeing company for the awacs aeroplane <e> <s> so it is not necessarily self-evident that all our defence equipment has to come from british-owned companies <e> <s> i am happy that per cent <e> <s> or more of it does come from british-owned companies but that is because by and large british companies have competed for and won that business and have not been handed it on a plate <e>", "<cs> my lords what the national interest requires in these circumstances is the right equipment to be supplied to our armed forces at the right price at the right time and to the right specification <e> <s> it is not self-evident that companies have to be british-owned to achieve that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that the noble lords supplementary question exactly arises

rightly implies that last suggestion is quite without foundation <e> <s> as to whether the generals remains should be returned to poland we think it important that we should canvass a wide range of polish opinion before agreeing to do that <e> <s> we did that comparatively recently when the consensus appeared to be that this was not the right time to do so but we shall certainly keep the matter under review <e>", "<cs> my lords i dare say the noble lord is right to say this move would be welcomed by many people in poland but there are other sectors of polish opinion which take a different view <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that any members of general sikorskis family are still alive who could be consulted but we have consulted a wide range of polish opinion and the outcome was as i described it <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that there have been many changes within poland since the summer of this year when my right honourable <e>", "<cs> my lords last weeks official talks in madrid enabled both governments to take significant steps towards more normal relations <e> <s> we will discuss the question of diplomatic relations at the next official talks in february <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble viscount for his congratulatory remarks about the negotiations which recently took place <e> <s> the arrangements for the protecting powers to which my noble friend referred will remain in place for the time being <e> <s> however the senior british representative now in argentina will be a consul general and indeed he will fly his consular flag at

<e> <s> i invite the noble baroness to study the joint statement that was made at the end of those talks which runs to two or three pages <e> <s> no one can forget the bravery of our armed forces in

community <e> <s> so although there are perhaps some disadvantages as regards the present arrangements there are also advantages <e> <s> nonetheless the situation is slightly anomalous and the post office has said that it intends to resolve the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords frankly that is the first question which i asked my officials this morning when i was being briefed on the matter <e> <s> the short answer is that a special consideration applies because of the border with northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords there are some places in the republic which are very close indeed to places in the united kingdom namely northern ireland <e> <s> it has seemed to be appropriate to have a second-class service for those destinations <e>", "<cs> my lords the post office management is determined to press ahead with the service improvements to which it referred at the time mentioned by my noble friend <e> <s> it would like to move ahead with a sunday collection programme but so far it has had difficulty in persuading the unions that that would be the right way in which to proceed <e> <s> it is continuing to endeavour to persuade the unions to agree and as i have said it hopes to introduce the first few collections soon <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the union management agreed to the introduction of sunday collections but that at a subsequent conference the union members decided that they were not prepared to take part <e> <s> it is not for me to interfere with the arrangements made within the trade union to arrive at its decision on the matter <e> <s> union members have said that for the moment they are not prepared to take part <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is saying that i am mistaken and that the union members are indeed now willing to take part in those collections there will be widespread appreciation of that point <e>", "<cs> my lords ministers are not responsible for the conduct of industrial relations discussions in the post office <e> <s> that is a matter for the management and the unions to sort out for themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that there are some areas where the service provided by the post office is less good than it should be <e> <s> the government are reassured by the managements determination to improve the service provided by the post office <e> <s> we hope that the unions will be able to participate in that process <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for the post office management to dictate in the way suggested by the noble lord <e> <s> the post office management is determined to secure a range of improvements in the service which the post office provides <e> <s> everyone agrees that those improvements are desirable <e> <s> we now look to the trade unions to co-operate in that process including i hope participation in sunday collections <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the job of the post office management to manage the post office if my noble friend will allow me to say so <e> <s> i am sure that the trade unions are as determined as the management to secure the necessary improvements in service <e> <s> i hope that they will now see that it is in their interests to co-operate fully with the management in achieving that end <e>", "<cs> my lords we all have our stories about problems with the post office <e> <s> sometimes it does a very good job indeed <e> <s> it is said that our post office is among the best in the world but it still suffers from some shortcomings which i hope and believe will be put right <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the five areas will be centred around folkestone and will involve the use of volunteers <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly many people in the post office work hard and carry out a first-class job <e> <s> however the fact is that the unions have prevented the introduction of the sunday collection which has been long awaited and much sought in recent times <e> <s> i hope that the unions will now review their position <e>", "<cs> my lords sunday collections are rather expensive for the post office to operate <e> <s> by and large staff have to be paid overtime rates to carry out the necessary work <e> <s> when the postage rates were increased at the end of last year the post office indicated that among the improvements planned was the restoration of the sunday collection <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason why the resumption of sunday collections can only for the moment be contemplated in a very small number of places is that volunteers will conduct the service <e> <s> however it would not be possible to restore sunday collections completely on the basis of volunteers only <e>", "<cs> my lords changes in the focus of the dtis policies including regional policy were made early last year <e> <s> regional policy now operates within a framework of measures designed to promote enterprise and business development throughout the country <e> <s> there are no plans for further changes <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with the noble lord about the decline in the amount of regional aid generally to which he referred <e> <s> however i make no apology for the fact that our regional assistance arrangements are now much more selectively focused than they once were and are not provided in the rather general way that used to be the case <e> <s> regional selective assistance is now very much in place <e> <s> there are the regional enterprise grants the activities of the english industrial estates corporation and more recently the consultancy grants too <e> <s> it is true that the regional development grants as they used to be called are being phased out <e> <s> however they were very unselective and the money that was spent on them was not always directed in the right way <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with my noble friend <e> <s> unemployment is coming down nationwide but especially so in those areas where it was a particular problem in times past <e> <s> i believe this is the result of the more selective targeting of our regional policy that we have introduced recently <e>", "<cs> my lords the way it will not be spent if the noble lord will allow me to say so is on indiscriminate support for projects of less than satisfactory viability <e> <s> that does not represent proper value for money for the taxpayer nor does it provide the kind of support that people are entitled to in the regions to which the noble lord has referred most especially scotland <e> <s> we shall target the support we can give in those areas as elsewhere to viable programmes when they are brought forward for our consideration and our support <e> <s> when they are they will certainly receive every encouragement <e>", "<cs> my lords the regional policy that we now have in place is not designed to encourage noble lords opposite <e> <s> it is designed to encourage the new enterprises emerging in the regions like those to which my noble friend lord elliott referred <e> <s> in those regions industrial and commercial activity is improving and unemployment is coming down <e> <s> that is the purpose of our policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not claim that unemployment has declined uniformly in all areas of the united kingdom <e> <s> however it has certainly come down very satisfactorily in a number of areas <e> <s> we are determined to ensure that in the areas where unemployment remains a problem the support that we are able to give is targeted so that unemployment comes down even faster <e> <s> i believe that the policy that we have in place will achieve that and i hope that on reflection the noble lord will agree with me <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures that i have before me do not include the amounts to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> i shall certainly see whether i can find those figures and write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that inflation the evil to which interest rates are addressed affects all parts of the economy not just the south-east <e> <s> it is of paramount importance to ensure that inflation is kept under control and reduced <e> <s> that is the purpose of the interest rate policy to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> i do not agree that interest rate policy can be applied selectively in different parts of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for interrupting the noble lord but i am afraid that he is out of order in quoting a back-bench member of another place <e>", "<cs> my lords as your lordships may recall the amendments that were originally accepted by this house would require that where a political donation was disclosed in the directors report that part of the report should not be signed but should be put to the general meeting retrospectively for approval by ordinary resolution <e>

am sure the noble lord would not want to increase those burdens except in the context of an appropriate legislative opportunity <e> <s> furthermore it is important that this legislation which will be of a highly technical nature is properly thought through before it is introduced into the house and that is what we intend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am interested to hear from my noble friend <e> <s> in fact legislation is already on the statute book dealing with this matter passed as far back as but the passage of time has shown that it needs to be updated and improved <e> <s> that is why professor home was asked to make a study and why we are now considering the matter carefully in order to bring through considered proposals for your lordships attention <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that the law in this matter needs to be updated <e> <s> professor home as i said has brought forward a number of proposals which are largely acceptable to the government <e> <s> we are therefore very reassured to hear that in the short period between now and when the legislation can come into force local authorities and the utilities concerned are increasing their co-operation to endeavour to get as many of professor homes recommendations as possible into place on a voluntary basis before they become statutory <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly share my noble friends view that we need to bring forward this legislation as soon as an opportunity can be found and as soon as it has been properly drafted and that is what we shall do <e> <s> i certainly also agree with him that some of the proposals which were not included in professor homes report but which have emerged more recently for financial constraints upon contractors in connection with the obstruction they cause and the time over which they cause them ought usefully to be included in the bill <e> <s> that too will have to be drafted before it can be presented <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that the position is quite as dark as the noble lord painted it <e> <s> while i agree that it would be appropriate to bring forward legislation as soon as may be the fact is that voluntary agreements are now coming into place between highway

the point just made by my noble friend <e> <s> however it is not for me to set down the questions on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps may answer just two of those supplementary questions put to me by the noble lord <e> <s> he raised first the point about reporting to parliamenent <e> <s> detailed financial matters are always reported to parliament through the medium of estimates and

trade and industry <e> <s> indeed since i joined the department in a more junior capacity i have been running hard to keep up with him <e>", "<cs> my lords had the matter been re-opened with the european commission i have no doubt that it would have taken some time to conclude further discussions <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that british aerospace was highly dubious about entering into the deal <e> <s> i have a feeling indeed i think that it was the view at the time and it was the right one that the company would have walked away <e>", "<cs> my lords the commission had concluded the application made at that time by my noble friends department <e> <s> it had agreed the outline of the arrangements which were in place <e> <s> the details which were subsequently discussed did not

that the noble lord has studied with his usual care the correspondence to which he refers <e> <s> however if he does so he will find that he is mistaken <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that in the aid figure was a higher percentage of the gdp than it is now but in we inherited a very modest gdp from the other party which was in power up to that time which if i may say so explains that phenomenon <e> <s> i am sure that the current figures will be of more interest to the noble lord <e> <s> the aid programme is now planned at million for growing to million and million respectively in the next two years <e> <s> those figures represent a cumulative real-terms increase of per cent <e> <s> compared with the million originally planned for this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i could easily be persuaded to agree with my noble friend <e> <s> but the fact of the matter is that we have accepted the target to which the noble lord lord hatch referred but like our predecessors we have been unable to say when we can achieve that <e> <s> as regards the central purpose of our aid programme i can put it in a nutshell by saying that it is to help those countries to help themselves <e> <s> that is why we concentrate no less than per cent <e> <s> of our aid programme on the poorest countries of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords it was because of the economic difficulties that we encountered when we came into office <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that the real growth to which i referred just now of per cent <e> <s> is a very substantial figure indeed leading as it will in a year or so to a figure of million of which per cent <e> <s> as i said earlier will go to the poorest countries of the world <e> <s> fifty per cent <e> <s> of that total goes to african countries an area of the world where i know the noble lord lord hatch has a special interest <e>", "<cs> my lords we have accepted the target in principle but like previous administrations and many other donors we are unable to set a date when we shall achieve it <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have figures for the francophone countries alone in front of me but i shall see if i can find them and then write to my noble friend <e> <s> while we cannot as yet set a date when we hope to attain the per cent <e> <s> target that has been referred to we have already met the per cent <e> <s> gnp target for total flows to developing countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i really cannot accept that <e> <s> the figures i gave earlier were for the real increase we expect which of course takes into account the relevant rate of inflation <e> <s> that is not a simple calculation because it depends on whether one takes into account inflation in this country or inflation in the recipient country or perhaps an average of the two <e> <s> different calculations have to be made in different cases <e> <s> i stand by the proposition that united kingdom aid is growing in real terms over the period that i referred to <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i am entitled to point to the shortcomings of the policy of the previous administration when they compare their performance with ours <e>", "<cs> my lords maintaining trade relations with iraq is not incompatible with the vigorous pursuit of the issues referred to by the noble lord <e> <s> we continue to give our full support to the united nations secretary general in his efforts to achieve early implementation of security council resolution in its entirety <e> <s> this expressly calls for the release of prisoners of war <e> <s> the iraqi government are in no doubt of our concerns over the british detainee mrs parish and over iraqs human rights record <e>", "<cs> my lords the difficulty is that consistency would mean the same policy in the same circumstances <e> <s> the problem is that the circumstances are never the same <e> <s> it is also the case that we are a major trading nation <e> <s> i am afraid that we have to do business with a number of countries with whose policies we very often disagree <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not sell arms to iraq <e> <s> as the noble lord will be aware the sale of such items to iraq and iran is subject to very close guidelines <e> <s> therefore arms would most certainly not be supplied in present circumstances <e> <s> there are in fact two british people in prison in iraq one of whom is a mrs parish <e> <s> so far she has not been charged and of course we believe that she should either be charged or released <e> <s> we have experienced some difficulty in gaining consular access to mrs parish <e> <s> however access was granted on th december and we are now looking to the iraqi authorities to grant continued access <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that closing off trading relations in these circumstances would in any way serve the objectives which the noble lord and i share namely an improvement in the human rights situation in that country and a proper observance of all the legal procedures for example in respect of the people to whom i referred <e> <s> i believe that maintaining trade relations helps in that direction <e> <s> indeed during the recent anglo-iraqi commission which i chaired on behalf of the united kingdom i lost no opportunity in conveying our views on such matters to the iraqi minister who came to represent his government <e>", "<cs> no my lords the reverse is the case <e> <s> i think that if we cut off our trading relations with these countries as with others we would lose many opportunities to convey our views on other matters which are i agree of great importance <e>", "<cs> my lords i have heard the rumours to which my noble friend refers but i am afraid that i cannot confirm them <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so that is a totally unproven assertion <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that i was able to make strong representations to the iraqi minister about for example mrs parish <e> <s> moreover i am not sure that it was total coincidence that consular access was granted shortly thereafter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i must say that trade sanctions or economic sanctions or indeed both of them together have hardly ever in <e>", "<cs> my lords the credits to iraq as to other countries which enjoy the benefit of ecgd facilities are generally renewed on an annual basis and are subject to what is called a market limit <e> <s> however i am afraid that the market limits are not normally published <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends memory goes back a little further than mine <e> <s> however this was certainly the policy of all the administrations which i can remember <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall certainly do all we can for mr bazoft <e> <s> as the noble lord said he was a journalist working i think for the

is within our law but not that which is without it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not agree with the noble lord <e> <s> the big bang as he refers to it has been of benefit to small investors too <e> <s> they need to shop around to find the best deal <e> <s> that is now made much more easy by the fact that the stock exchange publishes a free directory of member firms interested in private client business giving details of their services with in many cases commission rates <e> <s> so shop around is the message to small investors <e>", "<cs> my lords any stockbroker who charges too much is likely to lose the business that he is seeking to attract <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not claiming that all stockbrokers reduce their charges to small investors <e> <s> some do and they are therefore likely to attract much more of the business from small investors and good luck to them <e> <s> the number of small shareholders in this country has increased dramatically in recent times <e> <s> indeed following the water privatisation the other day the number is now something in excess of million <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> there is undoubtedly a range of very competitive stockbroking services available outside the city of london which i would commend to many small investors <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords arithmetic is no doubt correct but i am told that some minimum charges are less than the to which he points <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising in front of the serried ranks of my supporters i wish to thank both noble lords for their contributions to this debate <e> <s> i shall take the contributions in their reverse order <e> <s> i shall deal first with the points raised by my noble friend lord kimball who asked about the position in scotland <e> <s> i believe i am right in saying that he suggested that the much larger brewers operating in scotland who had substantial estates elsewhere might be at a disadvantage <e> <s> i suspect that the issue boils down to one of competition in loan ties for i find that in scotland only per cent <e> <s> of fully on-licensed premises are brewer owned compared with per cent <e> <s> in england and wales <e> <s> but clearly a brewer such as bass will not be able to offer loan ties which are exclusive to its products whereas scottish and newcastle for example will be able to do so if it reduces its estate below premises <e> <s> however i understand that at present the scottish and newcastle estate is a little larger than that <e> <s> however i do not accept that that makes the order unfair or discriminatory <e>", "<cs> my lords yes my right honourable friend has received the representations to which my noble friend refers but has not yet been able to reach a decision upon them <e>", "<cs> my lords the last part of the noble lords question is probably right <e> <s> generally speaking the service is a public monopoly <e> <s> we have made it clear that we do not at present plan to change the position <e> <s> but if the service deteriorated for any of the reasons to which i referred in the main answer then of course the matter would have to be reconsidered <e> <s> it was i believe my noble friend lord jenkin who last changed the terms of the monopoly about seven years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords yes the noble lord is right that the problems are not the same <e> <s> however they may lead to the same ending namely that the monopoly is suspended <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble lord is not correct <e> <s> the responsibility for the delivery service rests with the post office <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord has put his finger on the problem <e> <s> in addition to enjoying the privilege to which i have referred the post office accepts certain obligations <e> <s> they are to maintain the service from anywhere to anywhere else including sometimes very remote places <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to be able to tell my noble friend that sunday collections have restarted on a trial basis in five locations edinburgh belfast newcastle darlington and cardiff <e> <s> the post office intends to add more places by the end of february <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord is quite right to pay tribute to the efforts of the post office particularly at this time of the year <e> <s> as for the rate to which he referred as did my noble friend perhaps i may add that in germany for example far from being p the charge is p <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i could give a blanket assurance of that kind <e> <s> the fact is that there are areas where the service falls below an acceptable standard <e> <s> however the post office recognises that and is doing its best to put it right <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend saw the last report of the post office <e> <s> very detailed figures were given on the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i should like to repeat a statement being made in the other place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for trade and industry on the barlow clowes affair <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i acknowledge the contribution made by both noble lords in response to this statement <e> <s> the noble lord lord williams i shall deal with as many of his points as i can asked about the timing of the governments decision in this matter <e> <s> the noble lord will recall he referred to it that my noble friend made a statement on this subject just over a year ago <e> <s> we received the parliamentary commissioners report about four weeks ago in the middle of november and have therefore responded to it promptly and effectively <e>", "<cs> my lords to be truthful i am not quite certain about that but the noble lord may well be right <e> <s> certainly the decision to conduct the investigation rests with the parliamentary commissioner himself upon application from honourable or right honourable members in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall explain the position to the noble lord as best i can <e> <s> i hope that i shall get it right <e> <s> what will now happen is that investors will be reimbursed on the basis set out in the statement from public funds <e> <s> a few of them have already received some reimbursement from intermediaries who decided that they should reimburse on their own behalf and in certain cases some distributions have already been made in the liquidation <e> <s> however the very substantial payments which are now to be made are to come from public funds <e>", "<cs> no my lords that is not what would happen <e> <s> the first of any depositors claim will be dealt with on the basis of per cent <e> <s> and the second sum of money will be dealt with on the smaller percentage to which i referred when reading the statement <e> <s> as regards the position of those who have already received some recompense from whatever source the funds that they have received will be set against what they are to receive from public funds <e>", "<cs> my lords the parliamentary commissioner with all due respect to him is neither competent nor qualified to determine the question of legal liability <e> <s> however he has said that the government ought to repay the money <e>", "<cs> my lords the parliamentary commissioners report is an inch and a half thick or thereabouts <e> <s> i invite the noble lord to study that document carefully <e> <s> no doubt he will find the answer to his question therein <e>", "<cs> my lords the launch aid has been a continuous phenomenon if i may describe it like that although that is not quite an accurate description <e> <s> a number of different sums of launch aid money

family of aircraft <e> <s> it appears that that company will be able to sustain a considerable number of jobs in that programme for many years ahead <e>", "<cs> my lords that aircraft has yet to fly in prototype form but it is anticipated that it will have a range of some miles which should enable it to fly non-stop to australia <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an extremely complicated matter <e> <s> i have the information in front of me but perhaps the noble baroness will allow me to write to her <e>", "<cs> my lords it is intended to bring the ec directive into force in the near future <e> <s> that will have the effect of imposing control upon the operation of all kinds of package holidays <e> <s> we do not believe that it is right that all tour operators should belong to abta which does not necessarily cover the requirements of all branches of the travel trade <e> <s> however there will certainly be new provisions resulting from the directive <e>", "<cs> my lords we are on the side

on the subject <e> <s> it might unduly weary your lordships if i read that out <e> <s> pehaps the noble baroness will table a question for written answer and all your lordships can then benefit from

was an extremely difficult matter <e> <s> there was not a queue of companies forming up to buy this enterprise <e> <s> british aerospace was the only enterprise willing to make an offer for it <e> <s> british aerospace fiercely fought the negotiations indeed on the day before agreement was reached it nearly walked away <e> <s> the fact is that the taxpayer has achieved an extraordinarily good deal and i am very pleased about that <e>", "<cs> my lords no bid other than the one from british aerospace was received for the rover group <e> <s> some firms have alleged that they were making a bid or were going to make a bid but none did <e> <s> i think that the lonrho group or some persons purporting to speak for that group have suggested that they made a bid in association with a japanese company <e> <s> apparently the japanese knew nothing of it <e>", "<cs> my lords there was nothing to prevent anybody else making a bid if they had wished to do so <e> <s> the government would have been bound to consider such a bid had it been received <e>", "<cs> my lords i have made no such suggestion <e> <s> there may have been a failure of communications within the group <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not in a position to answer for the affairs of that or any other company <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be answering a question for written answer from the noble lord later today from which i hope that the noble lord will extract the necessary measure of satisfaction <e>", "<cs> my lords i should perhaps say that total exports in this sector from united kingdom manufacturers are very substantial <e> <s> i believe that the figure is of the order of billion or billion per annum <e> <s> although clearly the imports are even greater those imports are also contributing very significantly to the efficiency of the business sector which uses so many of those products <e>", "<cs> my lords what is important is to look at the balance of payments overall and not to be mesmerised by particular sectors <e> <s> overall our exports are doing very well <e> <s> the gap between exports and imports is narrowing as the noble lord will have seen from recent figures <e> <s> in some cases it is important and indeed quite acceptable to import products which the united kingdom is not particularly well placed to manufacture <e> <s> in this area and in relation to the products to which i referred there is a substantial british export industry <e> <s> the figures are further confused if i may so describe it by the so-called entrept activities of some firms in this area <e> <s> they are perfectly respectable but are not separately identified in the figures to which i have referred <e>", "<cs> my lords on the contrary we care about all sectors of british industry <e> <s> we look to the overall figures that are published on a regular basis as the noble lord will be aware <e> <s> we have been supporting this industry for example with assistance in research and development both on a united kingdom basis and on a multilateral european basis <e>", "<cs> my lords i am interested to hear about the cartoons on the wall of my noble and leanrned friends home <e> <s> however i was not responsible for the trade policy of <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble and learned friend was pointing to the shortcomings of the policies of noble lords opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords no i accept no such thing <e> <s> a number of these products are imported into this country because they are not manufactured here <e> <s> they are subsequently incorporated in major products being exported again to other countries <e> <s> for example the aerospace industry acquires some of its electronic components from overseas <e> <s> these are now forming a major part of our export success <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> there is a very considerable demand for expert and particularly experienced programmers in this field <e> <s> clearly if they speak english and especially if english is their mother tongue they have a head start <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who undertook part of his education in the united states i sympathise with the noble lords view <e> <s> however it is important that documentation relating to particular products meets precisely the requirements of the customer and that depends very much on his background <e>", "<cs> my lords yes indeed <e> <s> the british council does extremely good and important work in this area <e> <s> some people were taking advantage of british council services last year if my memory serves me right <e> <s> it is a business worth some million <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a difference between the language which a computer uses to talk to itself if i may describe it in that way and the language which a computer uses to talk to its user namely the language that appears on the screen <e> <s> the language that the computer talks to itself is highly technical <e> <s> it is not english or any other language known to the noble lord or to myself <e> <s> however it is important that the computers capability puts it in a position to talk to all its different customers whether they speak japanese english or any other language <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that clarification <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> i dare say that he is talking about eastern europe <e> <s> he will have heard of the know-how fund that has recently been established by the british government <e> <s> among other things it will be able to provide additional language training <e>", "<cs> my lords i seem to recall that laurels were a peculiarly roman institution <e>", "<cs> my lords the government certainly agree that there may be scope for further changes to the relevant legislation <e> <s> that is why we have brought forward the consultative document which deals with that point <e> <s> i dare say that the noble lord has seen it <e> <s> we look forward to hearing the views of relevant people on the proposals and to taking the matter forward in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that our record shows that we are <e> <s> as for the stock exchange which now has power with the secretary of states permission to carry out prosecutions of its own that power was contained in the companies act which the noble lord and i had a little to do with <e> <s> that power comes into effect today as ever is <e> <s> i dare say that the stock exchange will wish to take account of it <e> <s> it is important that we should have an adequate legal framework to govern this difficulty which would have the result of making prosecutions more effective <e> <s> i hope that it will also have a deterrent effect <e>", "<cs> my lords we have not formed a final position on what further legislative changes may be necessary <e> <s> that is why we have brought forward the consultative document to which i have referred and upon which we look forward to receiving the views of interested parties <e> <s> we shall form our view thereafter <e>", "<cs> my lords my own view is that we have a most distinguished body of judges in this country whose intellectual capacity seems to be equal to almost any of the problems with which they are confronted <e>", "<cs> my lords i am interested to hear the views of my noble friend <e> <s> if he wishes to convey his views formally on the consultative document they will be fully taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i do not know the answer to that question <e> <s> i shall rapidly find it out and let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall stand by the general observations that i made <e>", "<cs> my lords i bow to the superior knowledge of the noble lord in these matters <e> <s> if he is correct as i daresay he is i shall hasten to confirm that fact <e>", "<cs> my lords the motion in the name of the noble lord lord williams of elvel has provided the occasion for the latest in a series of debates in your lordships house on the prospects for manufacturing industry <e> <s> these debates have been enlivened not only by the usual robust exchanges but also by the contributions of individual noble lords of all parties or none with direct and relevant experience of manufacturing industry <e> <s> i include in particular the maiden speech of the noble lord lord crook to which we had the privilege of listening earlier this afternoon <e> <s> it was a most meritorious contribution and like other noble lords i look forward to hearing him again soon and often <e>", "<cs> my lords none of those suggestions is true <e> <s> the noble lords question has an air of <e>", "<cs> my lords not that i am aware <e>", "<cs> my lords statements made to this house and to the other place on this matter and on all others are always truthful <e> <s> therefore the noble lords question does not arise <e>", "<cs> my lords rather better than it did under the old ownership <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that there was any mirth on this side of the house at the suggestion that we were not telling the truth <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that the truth has been told in respect of this matter as of all others <e>", "<cs> my lords that was the strong impression that i too received <e>", "<cs> my lords i assure the noble lord that this government do not resort to bribery or deception as the noble lord suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords given my earlier answer the noble lords question does not arise <e>", "<cs> my lords on the face of it it would certainly appear that this official did not properly discharge his duties in the conduct of this election <e> <s> i certainly believe that mr todd was right to call for a new election <e> <s> i dare say that he regrets that as much as the noble lord <e> <s> it will be an additional expense which is to be regretted <e> <s> however i believe that is better than to allow the election to be improperly conducted <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my original answer there is a proper procedure for complaints about the conduct of elections <e> <s> that is the right way to proceed <e> <s> i also believe that mr todd was right to convene a new election <e>", "<cs> my lords the shortcomings in the conduct of elections in trade unions were not formerly confined to the transport and general workers union <e> <s> that is why we have introduced legislation in recent years to correct the position and to make the officials in trade unions much more accountable to their members <e> <s> we have included procedures whereby members can complain about the conduct of elections and have any shortcomings put right <e> <s> i believe that that is the right way to proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i should like to repeat a statement on the house of fraser being made by my right honourable <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords lord williams and lord ezra asked me a number of questions <e> <s> i shall reply to as many of them as i can <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend makes an interesting point <e> <s> however i believe the responsibility for the conduct of professional advisers such as merchant banks and solicitors does not necessarily rest with the government <e> <s> it is the law society which governs the conduct of solicitors and it is the bank of england which governs the conduct of banks <e> <s> the bank of england received a copy of the report some time ago and the law society received a copy today <e> <s> it is for those bodies to decide what action they need to take in the light of the reports findings <e> <s> my noble friend is also quite right to point out that the propositions that the fayed brothers made about their wealth to the authorities were supported fully by their professional advisers <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards publication of the report the noble lord may recall that my noble friend the former secretary of state said in this house that he was most anxious to publish the <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but they are principally the al fayed brothers themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord rightly quoted from the summary of the report which appears in the opening pages <e> <s> as he himself recognises the report is or so pages long and goes into great detail on some of the matters which the noble lord mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not a matter for me but for the usual channels <e> <s> i dare say that it will be discussed in those channels in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite ready to say that that accusation is quite without foundation <e>", "<cs> my lords if changes are to be made to the takeover rules that is a matter for the takeover panel which has received a copy of the report and can make whatever changes it considers appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords i dealt with the question of the possible disqualification of the directors concerned in an earlier reply to the noble lord lord williams and others and i have nothing to add <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the case that the stamps are not intended for international service <e> <s> however the post office realised that some people were likely to use them for that purpose and therefore asked overseas postal authorities to accept them <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the supplementary question by the noble lord lord tordoff about international postage i can only say that before i prepared myself to make this reply i posted a letter to a relative in canada bearing three of these stamps <e> <s> i have yet to discover whether it arrived <e> <s> i hope it did <e>", "<cs> my lords we have no present plans to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the case that your lordships have asked a number of questions in recent months with regard to the performance of the post office <e> <s> i am bound to say that there are areas where the standard of service provided falls below an acceptable level <e> <s> however the post office authorities are very much aware of that <e> <s> they are doing their utmost to put it right and there have been a number of recent improvements <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that that is indeed correct and we look forward to reaping the fruits of that agreement in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so i do not agree with the noble lord <e> <s> the post office recognised that these stamps which were only issued as a temporary measure might be used for international services <e> <s> it was that which persuaded it to contact all the overseas postal authorities to ask them to honour these stamps when they arrived in their countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure to what matter the noble lord refers <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the message was sent comparatively recently and therefore i am not able to say what the response has been <e> <s> equally i understand there has not so far been any difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that there will be no time-limit on the usage of the stamps <e> <s> i can also confirm that this was only a temporary measure and stocks are now running out <e>", "<cs> my lords back in when i first spoke from the dispatch box in an even more junior position than today i said that we would join the exchange rate mechanism when the time was right <e> <s> i am happy to say that that remains the position <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for saying that because it is indeed the case <e> <s> i believe that only about six of the directives and other documents emerging from brussels in that context have yet to be implemented by the united kingdom <e> <s> we accept the purport of all of them and will adhere to them as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords a great range of factors must be taken into account all of which receive constant attention <e>", "<cs> my lords the most important thing that we must do before the time will be right is to ensure that inflation is under control <e> <s> that was why my noble friend just gave the answers that he did <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to say that i was born in llandrindod wells <e> <s> i have derived great benefit for the advertisements to which the noble lord referred which as it happens i was intimately involved in preparing <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot promise that we shall introduce legislation for this purpose <e> <s> however i hope that adequate protection can be provided by a code of practice which the director general is currently discussing with the professional and trade organisations concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord would have to complain to the person who sent it <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i am entitled to say that your lordships have welcomed this bill even if that welcome is somewhat guarded and qualified <e> <s> i shall endeavour to deal with some of the points raised without straying into too much detail which no doubt your lordships will want to do at the next stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not confine my advice to that given by the department of trade and industry <e> <s> there are many other sources of advice available to all members of your lordships house and i am happy to avail myself of those facilities <e>", "<cs> my lords the figure to which the noble lord refers is a percentage of gnp <e> <s> if the aid figure stays level or even grows it does not necessarily grow as a percentage of gnp if gnp itself is substantially growing as it is <e> <s> the arithmetic is not as simple as the noble lord may think <e> <s> i do not claim to be be an arithmetical expert but i stand by the overall figures which i have given to the noble lord <e> <s> the aid programme stands at million this year and is planned to grow to million by to <e> <s> those are substantial sums by any standard <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will feel able to recognise that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i do not have the breakdown for which the noble baroness asks <e> <s> however i shall find out whether it is available <e> <s> i certainly accept that from some countries in particular many fewer women attend our courses than we would wish <e> <s> we are exploring ways of correcting that problem <e> <s> however in many cases the problem arises from the social economic and traditional situation in the countries concerned <e> <s> i am not sure that we should disrupt those traditions in a way that would altogether meet the concern of the noble baroness <e> <s> however i share her concern <e> <s> where there are ways of overcoming it we shall seek to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to the first supplementary question of my noble friend i very much agree with the point that he makes <e> <s> indeed it is changes in that direction that i believe we have achieved through discussions in brussels <e>", "<cs> my lords a cosmetics directive from the european community has been in place since as far back as <e> <s> we are now discussing a new directive to amend and take forward the directive <e> <s> the representations that we have made through our membership of the relevant committees in brussels have moved the draft directive that is all it is at the moment in the right direction <e> <s> we not only have to meet the proper aspirations of those who have understandable and quite proper concern about the testing of these products on animals we also need to ensure that the cosmetics industry brings forward new products that are safe and demonstrably so <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that it is a market matter <e> <s> a number of firms are now marketing cosmetics about which they make a virtue of the fact that they have not been tested on animals <e> <s> if people prefer to buy such cosmetics that is their undoubted right <e> <s> however the definition of cosmetics goes wider than preparations used by women <e> <s> it includes items such as soap toothpaste shampoo and deodorant some of which i use <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to have to tell my noble friend that it is not possible to obtain the necessary degree of confidence in the safety of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to say that as a result of the changes that we have secured in the proposed draft directive the effects upon the welsh sheep to which the noble lord referred will be much less than otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords that particular detail has not yet come before the council of ministers <e>", "<cs> my lords the decision as to whether there should be a prosecution rests with the prosecuting authorities as i have already said <e> <s> there is a difference between what is right and proper in regard to launching a prosecution and what the inspectors say <e> <s> there is a specific difference which i shall come to in a moment if the noble lord will allow me <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord raises a very important and proper point which i shall come to in a moment <e> <s> i wish to say a little more about the inspectors report and the difference between it the evidence which they take into account and that which the prosecuting authorities also take into account <e> <s> i shall say something further about these matters in a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should explain to my noble friend that there are two opportunities for those criticised in a report in this way to make their views known at least to the authors of the report <e>", "<cs> my lords he could have gone to the high court and taken action to prevent publication <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is much more learned in these matters than i <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not pretend to be an expert on legal detail on these matters but i am advised that it was open to the fayed brothers to take action if they thought fit in order to prevent publication <e> <s> evidently they decided not to do so <e> <s> the question of whether there were to be criminal charges was as i have said a matter for the prosecution authorities <e> <s> however it fell to my right honourable friend the present secretary of state to consider whether he should make application to <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> he has power to initiate an application but not to order the disqualification himself this power is quite rightly left to the court <e> <s> in deciding not to make an application he took into account the fact that the court may make a disqualification order i emphasise the word may where it is satisfied that the conduct of the director in relation to the company those are words which the noble lord lord williams repeated makes him unfit to be concerned in the management of the company <e> <s> in making its decision the court must have regard in particular to the matters mentioned in part i of schedule of the act though these are not exhaustive <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend will be aware that takeover regulations are being discussed in the european community <e> <s> they are likely to come into effect in september this year <e> <s> they will substantially level the playing field to which my noble friend referred <e> <s> however your lordships may be interested to know that relatively speaking the united kingdom is much more active in overseas markets than are overseas companies in the united kingdom market <e> <s> for example in <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord that that is a matter which needs to be kept under fairly careful scrutiny <e> <s> it is certainly no part of united kingdom policy to move companies from the public to the private sector and then back into somebody elses public sector particularly when that overseas public sector does not operate in a properly commercial and competitive way <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree with my noble friend that until recently anyway the european playing field has not been very well tilled <e> <s> there have been some sticky spots on part of the wicket if i may describe the situation in that way <e> <s> that is why we have been playing such an active part in the preparation of the current regulations and why we attach such importance to some of the directives which are currently being considered in the same area <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with that at all <e> <s> the ec is moving steadily towards the completion of the single european market <e> <s> we greatly support all the steps that are being taken in that area <e> <s> we are in the forefront in ensuring that our own regulatory and statutory system meets all the requirements which have been set out and which have been agreed across such a wide base <e> <s> all the members of the ec have declared and agreed their objectives to complete and perfect the single european market by the end of <e> <s> we now hope and believe that that will happen <e>", "<cs> my lords in general terms i believe that my noble friend is mistaken <e> <s> in moving to a free trade situation whether it be in matters of this kind or as regards more conventional trade arrangements these objectives are not achieved by the united kingdom or other important players in those areas raising barriers in the way which my noble friend would have us do <e> <s> we have to lead from the front in these matters <e> <s> i am very proud of the united kingdoms record in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with the noble lord <e> <s> i am entitled to quote those figures to my noble friend because of the implication in his question that united kingdom companies were being taken over on a large scale while united kingdom companies had no opportunity in overseas markets <e> <s> that is not the case <e> <s> united kingdom companies have achieved wide success in world markets particularly in acquiring overseas companies <e> <s> we are a major player on the world investment scene <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord wants other examples about other parts of the world i shall be happy to recite those too <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not claim that the position is perfect in every market in which we have to operate <e> <s> my noble friend is quite right to point out that switzerland is not a member of the european community and is therefore not bound by the european community regulations and directives unless it chooses to be so <e> <s> certainly we shall be arguing in specific cases for countries to bring their arrangements more into line with those which we regard as acceptable <e> <s> by and large references to the monopolies and mergers commission i imagine that this is what my noble friend had in mind are made on grounds of competition not on grounds of who the new owner might be <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> i wish she had intervened a few moments earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords the implication of my noble friends question was that it was a bad thing that these firms were being taken over in the way he described <e> <s> i do not accept that proposition <e> <s> each case has to be examined on its merits principally from the point of view of competition <e> <s> but it is also open to the shareholders of the companies concerned to decide what is in their best interests <e> <s> in almost every case these takeovers take place because shareholders like the offer that is made to them <e> <s> who am i to qualify their judgment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly true that many of the enterprises to which i referred were involved in the manufacture of motor cars <e> <s> they will certainly represent an important aspect of our export performance in the future <e> <s> that is why it is so important that there should be free circulation within the european community in accordance with the provisions of the treaty of rome <e>", "<cs> my lords these figures were announced by the promoters at the time that they launched their projects <e> <s> they do not take account of changes which have taken place since that time whether they were reductions or even increases <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that my noble friend is right <e> <s> it is also a reflection of the improved industrial relations climate in this country which has resulted from the various pieces of legislation that have been brought in <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will forgive me i must point out to him that that is another question <e> <s> in my view these are satisfactory figures as my noble friend indicated <e> <s> i agree that not every aspect of manufacturing industry has benefited from these inward investment decisions but clearly major areas have benefited including important areas of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that my noble friend is wholly correct <e> <s> there have been many important inward investment decisions relating to research and development establishments <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly the case that the balance of payments deficit at present is almost wholly taken up by motor car imports of one kind or another from one country or another <e> <s> that is why investment decisions such as those referred to by my noble friend are so important and why they will indeed have a very beneficial effect on the balance of payments as he indicated <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not in a particularly self-congratulatory mood <e> <s> the figures speak for themselves they need no help from me <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether the noble lord fully appreciates the extent of the help that has been given <e> <s> the grant of per cent <e> <s> of the emergency expenditure which will be provided under the bellwin formula is more in percentage terms than is usually provided under that formula <e> <s> it is likely to amount to between million and million depending on precisely what the expenditure turns out to be <e> <s> i do not believe that that is an inconsiderable contribution nor is the contribution to the disaster funds to which i also referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with the first part of the noble lords supplementary question <e> <s> it was an appalling catastrophe for the area concerned and the emergency services responded splendidly <e> <s> if i may say so i think that the government responded splendidly too <e>", "<cs> yes my lords in so far as the expenditure to which the noble lord referred falls within the bellwin definition <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall deal with all the points <e> <s> i apologise for not answering the point raised by the noble lord the leader of the opposition <e> <s> i am advised that about people are still in temporary accommodation following the events of february and that work clearly still needs to be done on the houses belonging to those people before they can return to them <e> <s> as i think is well known many of those living in that part of the country are elderly and retired people who for obvious reasons choose to live in bungalows <e> <s> bungalows are particularly subject to flooding when such events occur <e> <s> the people concerned have therefore been very adversely affected <e> <s> the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> there were rather more people than we should have wished who were not adequately covered by insurance either with no insurance or inadequate insurance <e> <s> the special disaster contributions to which i referred will be specifically aimed at helping those people <e>", "<cs> my lords that would mean raising the bellwin percentage to per cent <e> <s> from per cent <e> <s> as i understand it under the bellwin <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e> <s> in so moving i should like to explain why a government amendment that i had intended to table is not on the marshalled list today <e> <s> in my speech in which i moved the second reading of the bill on nd march i stated that the government intended to bring forward an amendment to provide that special arrangements for compensation should apply during the period of adjustment to a more open market <e>", "<cs> my lords with the agreement of your lordships perhaps i may now bring the debate to a conclusion <e> <s> i wish to make it quite clear that i had every intention of tabling an amendment and instructed my officials so to do <e> <s> when they arrived at the public bill office they were told that the amendment was not within the scope of the bill and could not therefore be tabled in accordance with their advice <e> <s> i very much regret that but that is the fact of the matter <e> <s> i undertake to consider very carefully what has been said during the debate and to do my best to resolve the matter between now and the next stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly shall <e>", "<cs> the government take the view that the amendments would involve too great a departure from the principle that we should not arbitrarily change the basis of existing agreements <e> <s> in recent years the most common form of pub tenancy has been the three-year agreement <e> <s> if the amendments were accepted all such tenancies entered into since july would be brought within the framework of the act <e> <s> in other words some two-thirds of current agreements would be affected and put on a basis which neither landlord nor tenant could have anticipated at the outset <e> <s> in general the government do not believe that agreements entered into on a particular basis should have that basis changed unless there are very good reasons <e>", "<cs> if i have omitted to offer praise where it is due i hasten to rectify that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am bound to say from what i have heard that the present facilities at oxford station are not up to the standard that we ought to expect <e> <s> i hope that british rail will be able to improve them <e> <s> indeed i understand that it had a meeting with oxford city council and has agreed in principle that lifts should be installed as soon as funds are available and in any event within the next three years <e> <s> i dare say that that has something to do with the pressure exerted by my noble friend and i congratulate her on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that a number of organisations for the disabled make representations to british rail as indeed they do quite properly to other bodies <e> <s> indeed it was such representations to public bodies that led to the inclusion of section in the act to which i have referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i fancy that that truism is now dawning upon british rail <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite certain that british rail is fully seized of its responsibilities under the section to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> however as he pointed out it is required to make these provisions only when it is both practicable and reasonable so to do <e> <s> there are circumstances where practicability or reasonableness prevent facilities from being provided in the short or medium term <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the last part of the noble lords question yes of course finance plays a part <e> <s> some facilities are very expensive <e> <s> for example i understand that the lifts it is now proposed to install at oxford station will cost about <e> <s> that is a substantial sum which has to be found from somewhere <e> <s> very often such provision has to take its place in the queue of priorities <e>", "<cs> my lords no the government do not directly finance those requirements <e> <s> under the act it is a duty placed upon public bodies which in general are required to find the funding <e> <s> however british rail often does so in association with local authorities and that is the intention with regard to oxford <e>", "<cs> my lords to the best of my knowledge section is not constrained by criminal considerations as my noble and learned friend suggests <e> <s> however i shall happily

matters have been established is in the mind of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the commission is undoubtedly entitled to inquire into this matter under the terms of the treaty of rome and to express a view which we understand it will shortly give <e>", "<cs> my lords i repeat to the noble lord that there has never been any question of seeking to mislead parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with my noble and learned friend that it would be much better to wait on the report from the european commission before commenting on it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me to decide on such matters <e> <s> however i shall be very surprised indeed if that did not happen <e>", "<cs> my lords i suggest to the noble lord that he takes the advice of my noble and learned friend and

most people who have commented on the speech have not read it <e> <s> perhaps i may place a copy in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords the process by which my right honourable friend arrives at his own personal views is a matter for him <e>", "<cs> my lords to refer to the second part of the noble lords supplementary question that is another matter <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that the doctrine of collective responsibility is alive and well in this administration <e>", "<cs> my lords as my right honourable friend the foreign secretary has said recently these are very important matters and there is a good deal of agile thinking going on in the administration about them <e>", "<cs> my lords all ministers speak personally but that does not detract from the doctrine of collective responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lord i believe that the views of my right honourable friend are very much in accordance with the interests of the united kingdom and for that matter of the european community as well <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend did not use the phrase two-speed europe and i hope that the noble lord will read the speech in full when he has a chance to read the copy that i shall place in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords that depends upon the circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords that is probably the first time in my life that somebody has said that <e>", "<cs> my lords i know of no bitter battles going on in the cabinet as the noble lord suggests although there is often very useful discussion on these issues <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely accept the moving nature of the original declaration by general de gaulle <e> <s> i have a text of it with me <e> <s> i have not seen the article in the <e>", "<cs> my lords as a matter of fact i agree with the noble lord <e> <s> too few people in this country speak decent french and i am afraid that i am among them <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will forgive me for saying so but

immediately important as speaking the french language <e> <s> i dare say that there are steps which could and should be taken to improve the take-up of french <e> <s> indeed my own department the department of trade and industry is doing something about that in the context of the single european market <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord puts a different gloss on these matters <e> <s> i can only add that we have come a long way since the battle of waterloo which was years ago today <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord caithness dealt exhaustively with the erm a question or so ago <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will forgive me if i am not dragged down that particular path <e> <s> as for the social charter the noble lord knows the views of the government <e> <s> i can assure him that they have not changed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i want to follow the noble lord down that path <e> <s> so far as our wartime experiences go the part played by the free french under the leadership of general de gaulle was indeed remarkable <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> our relations with france today are extraordinarily warm friendly cordial and very constructive <e> <s> i believe that they have been made even better through the european community and indeed will go further with the completion of the single european market <e>", "<cs> my lords we had better get the tunnel finished first <e>", "<cs> my lords my answers have related to the question on the order paper which specifically referred to france <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that if people do not wish to receive such mail they should be spared from doing so <e> <s> however the fact is that many people like to receive junk mail <e> <s> it is important that <e>", "<cs> my lords the present arrangements are as my noble friend may be aware that people who do not wish to receive junk mail of a particular kind can contact the mailing

noble friend had in mind <e> <s> however that is an important point which i shall draw to the authoritys attention <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not junk mail <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that such activity should be stopped as a matter of principle <e> <s> firms are entitled to seek to bring their goods to the attention of customers by the use of the mail if that is how they wish to do it

lords most of the mail which we are discussing arising from this question is posted under the benefit of contract cost arrangements <e> <s> therefore that is a slightly different matter <e> <s> however as the noble lord says there has been a recent announcement which is a matter for the post office <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> there was a question on that matter a few months ago <e> <s> that is <e>", "<cs> my lords that is going rather farther than is intended by the present arrangements <e> <s> with regard to banks in particular it is important that those kinds of selling methods are not used to induce young people to take on more credit than they should use <e>", "<cs> my lords numerous companies are involved <e> <s> some are very small and some are larger <e> <s> therefore i am not sure that that would be practical <e> <s> however i believe that the present arrangements by which people can if they wish have their names deleted from the lists is the best way to proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has underlined the point which i made a few moments ago <e> <s> it is not the case that all this mail is necessarily bad <e> <s> for some it is very good

the assurance which the noble lord seeks <e> <s> the contract rates are a confidential commercial matter between customers and the post office <e>", "<cs> my lords although it is usual for a minister from the dti to attend meetings of the industry council on this occasion the business was both uncontroversial and routine and attendance by a minister was not necessary <e> <s> the uk seat was therefore taken by the uk permanent representative to the community sir david hannay supported by senior dti officials <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer for the ministers of other countries i can only answer for the ministers of the united kingdom <e> <s> we took the view that the matters were not of sufficient importance to justify the attendance of a minister <e> <s> no decisions were taken

qualified to undertake the task on that day <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> equally it would have been possible for a junior minister to attend <e> <s> i should have been happy to attend myself but it simply was not worth the bother <e>", "<cs> all of them my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords decisions are taken according to the merits of each specific occasion <e> <s> this

merits <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe the noble lord referred to me i have not made a bruges speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise <e> <s> i do not think the two are in any way connected <e> <s> the speech to which the noble lord refers and about which he questioned me the other day was an extremely important and very worthwhile one <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the view of the noble lord <e> <s> i am happy that there is now only one noble lord who thinks that <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not the case at all <e> <s> different matters affect different nations in different ways <e> <s> the united kingdom did not consider it necessary for a minister to attend <e> <s> we considered our interests to be more than adequately represented by sir david hannay <e>", "<cs> my lords a number of changes took place after that answer was given <e> <s> as the noble lord said it was a draft agenda that my honourable friend referred to <e> <s> the nature of the discussion became apparent only after that was produced <e>", "<cs> my lords it is indeed the case that ministers nowadays have to attend a great many meetings <e> <s> there is therefore sometimes a balance to be made <e> <s> on this occasion we judged that the balance lay in not attending <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only tell my noble friend what i have been advised and that was reflected in my answer <e> <s> if there is a difficulty in reading and newbury perhaps my noble friend will allow me to look into the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that it will concentrate on both issues <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the post office hopes to have sunday collections implemented everywhere in the united kingdom by autumn this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of any plans to reduce the number of deliveries as suggested by the noble lord <e> <s> however if i am mistaken i shall write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords there are still staffing difficulties in the london districts including i fear nw <e> <s> for that reason most of the areas to which i referred where sunday collections have not yet begun are in london and the post office is making a special effort to correct the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords relations are good <e>", "<cs> my lords as a result of the visit of the prime minister of fiji to my right honourable friend mrs thatcher in march british technical co-operation was increased from million to million in order to allow for extra help in the medical sector which had been depleted by the migration of trained fiji-indian doctors <e> <s> the first members of the united kingdom-recruited team arrived in fiji in february <e> <s> my noble friend will be aware that the principal problem now confronting the fijians is the agreement of their new constitution <e> <s> i

diplomats from fiji and that did not help the matter to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> we attach great importance to our relations with fiji <e> <s> however as the noble lord will know its

misinformed <e> <s> my right honourable friend has reached no decisions on this matter and nor has he announced them <e> <s> however it is true that in due course we shall move the short-term part of the ecgds business into the private sector that has already been announced <e> <s> we are also considering the future for the projects side of the business to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> the important objective is to ensure that british exporters remain equipped to compete effectively in world markets <e> <s> that is certainly what we shall do <e>", "<cs> my lords again the noble lord is not well informed on this matter <e> <s> the government are taking a number of steps to promote and support the activities of british firms in the newly emerging markets of eastern europe <e> <s> i say that they are newly emerging but the economies of most of the countries concerned are in very considerable disarray <e> <s> there is a limit to the amount of money that to put it frankly we should pour down the drain in some of those places where there is no prospect of a sensible return ensuing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am all for the entrepreneurial spirit to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> we shall certainly support and encourage appropriate entrepreneurism in sensible cases <e> <s> the fact is that in poland for example the ecgd already has major liabilities <e> <s> i am not sure that we would be doing the poles any favour by lending them more money <e> <s> we shall certainly try to help in other ways such as through the know-how fund to which i have referred and through the possibility of guaranteeing investments in eastern european countries which may be aimed particularly at generating exports to help their economies get back on the rails <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that we need to do everything we can to ensure that there are no unnecessary bureaucratic difficulties placed in the way of commercial exchanges of every kind <e> <s> a number of improvements and simplifications have been made recently to the visa regimes <e> <s> for example in respect of some countries we are allowing applicants to have a multiple entry visa as opposed to a single entry visa <e> <s> i believe that that goes some way towards meeting the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i would wish to comment on that unhappy possibility <e> <s> the united kingdom already has major lines of credit open to the ussr much of which has not been taken up but is available for use by soviet buyers if they think fit <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord thinks that our presence is small <e> <s> i should point out that it has been greatly strengthened in recent times <e> <s> we are seeking to seize the opportunities that are available particularly for example through the medium of joint ventures and projects of that kind which do not need hard currency <e> <s> the fact is that most if not all the eastern european countries are extremely short of hard currency and are therefore very constrained in what they can do except by means of projects which earn the necessary hard currency <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the select committees report to which the noble baroness referred <e> <s> as regards the draft directive as the noble baroness will be aware we believe that it still contains a number of shortcomings <e> <s> that is why we believe that further work needs to be done on it before it can be taken forward <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of whether progress can be carried forward on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have that information in front of me <e> <s> i shall ascertain the date and let the noble baroness know <e>", "<cs> my lords i recited at some length the topics that were considered at the council meeting to which the noble baroness referred <e> <s> if she is now referring to the commissions three-year plan on consumer policy i can best describe that as being something like the curates egg <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i can elaborate further on the lengthy original answer that i gave on this matter <e> <s> if there is any further information on the topic that the noble baroness raised i shall write to her <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i wish to repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for trade and industry on the decision reached yesterday by the european commission following its review of the arrangements reached with british aerospace regarding the sale of the government shareholding in rover group <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether your lordships and i refer to both noble lords fully recall the circumstances which surrounded this transaction <e> <s> to put it bluntly the rover group was on its uppers <e> <s> it had spent thousands of millions of pounds of taxpayers money and was set to spend thousands more <e> <s> i believe that the government were right and that my noble friend lord young was right to seek to return the rover group to the private sector and hence to put the financial responsibility where it rightfully belonged <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has had his chance to speak <e> <s> he may speak further later on <e> <s> i am attempting to explain the background to this matter <e> <s> it appears to me that that had not occurred to the noble lord when he made his intervention <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has made that allegation on more than one occasion <e> <s> i have rejected before and i do so again today the allegation that parliament was in some way deceived <e> <s> as i have already said and i do not mind repeating it the rover group was on its uppers <e> <s> only one firm was seriously interested in taking it over <e> <s> the commission has confirmed that fact and that answers the issue raised by the noble lord lord ezra <e> <s> there was only one credible bidder <e> <s> i think that british aerospace did the british taxpayer a great favour by taking over the company <e> <s> i am greatly obliged to bae for so doing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that that is the sort of high philosophy which generally excapes me on these occasions <e> <s> however i respect the noble lords point of view <e> <s> he was of course a distinguished president of the commission not so very long ago <e> <s> therefore he will understand that the commission and the governments of member states often form different views on the same subject <e> <s> this was one such occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am greatly obliged to my noble friend i entirely agree <e> <s> what would noble lords opposite have had us do <e> <s> would they have had us allow the company to go bankrupt <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be obliged if the noble lord would keep quiet when in a sedentary position <e> <s> if he wishes to intervene i will give way <e> <s> would they have had us allow the company to go bankrupt with the cost to the taxpayer of perhaps or million <e> <s> about people would have been put out of work in the west midlands <e> <s> if that is what noble lords opposite seek then let them say so loud and clear <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will forgive me for saying so i believe that he lives in a world of his own <e> <s> companies in the public sector have almost without exception failed to prosper <e> <s> the rover group was no exception <e> <s> the fact truthfully is that ministers and officials are very bad at running industrial enterprises <e> <s> that applies just as much to conservatives as to noble lords and others opposite <e> <s> the best people to run commercial and industrial enterprises are commercial and industrial experts not ministers and officials <e> <s> that is i fear the basic reason why all these nationalised enterprises have done so badly over the years <e> <s> british leyland or the rover group as it became were no exception to that rule <e> <s> we were right to return the business to the private sector <e> <s> there was only one conceivable purchaser and that was british aerospace <e> <s> there were no other serious bidders <e> <s> the commission has accepted that point <e> <s> british aerospace was prepared to pay million for the business and that was a good deal for the british taxpayer <e>", "<cs> my lords i have said on more than one occasion today that the appropriate procedures for reporting these matters to parliament were complied with <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord opposite and his noble right honourable and honourable colleagues are keen to draw our attention to circumstances where they think more money could be paid or money should not be saved <e> <s> this transaction saved the british taxpayer thousands of millions of pounds and i am proud that it did so <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the discussions that we had with the commission on this matter about which i dare say the noble lord will have heard although he had left the commission by that time were entirely right and proper <e> <s> of course we have had a disagreement with the commission on the matter <e> <s> i do not for a moment deny that <e> <s> however there is nothing disreputable about having a disagreement <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill has had a chequered history <e> <s> it has now reached report stage in your lordships house and not for the first time a great many important new issues are proposed for debate <e> <s> the rash of amendments that appear each time this bill reaches a new stage is a poor indicator of its general state of health <e> <s> the governments anxieties are on record about the proposals on consumer guarantees <e> <s> during the committee stage in this house my noble friend lord ullswater made plain that the government do not accept the policy behind this approach <e>", "<cs> my lords the last point made by my noble friend is a matter for the contractual terms rather than the practice of estate agents business generally <e> <s> as to the first question posed by my noble friend we believe that the way to proceed should have been by means of an agreed code of practice if that could have been achieved <e> <s> it is regrettable that the director general of fair trading was not able to achieve that <e> <s> however i believe that the way forward now proposed by means of a range of regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not necessarily disagree with the noble lord any more than i disagreed with my noble friend <e> <s> however it is important to remember that responsibility for the practices to which the noble lord refer red rests with individual parties involved in the transaction <e> <s> estate agents are sometimes drawn in to such practices through their common law obligation to pass on all offers to their clients but i do not believe that the solution to the problem necessarily lies in regulating the profession in the way my noble friend suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe so <e> <s> naturally one of the purposes of the consultation is to ensure that there are no obvious gaps such as the noble lord has suggested <e> <s> a number of requirements will be laid on estate agents in terms of what they must do as well as a range of things that they must riot do <e> <s> i hope that if the noble lord is able to find the time to study carefully the four different sets of regulations he will come to the same conclusion as we have <e>", "<cs> my lords we are always anxious to hear the views of every noble lord including those sitting on the other side of the house <e> <s> i can reassure the noble lord that he has until st july to submit his views and if he wishes to do so we shall be very happy to receive them <e>", "<cs> my lords whether that was the same route by which the noble lord lord williams received his copy i cannot say <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no legal impediment to the use of the scottish system in england and wales <e> <s> however the certainty that it offers to prospective vendors and purchasers is to some extent offset by other disadvantages <e>", "<cs> my lords the director general of fair trading went to considerable lengths to try to persuade the bodies concerned or maybe one of them if that could have been agreed to produce a code of practice which might conceivably have included the kind of provision which the noble lord indicated <e> <s> it is a matter for regret that that did not prove possible <e> <s> naturally any professional body involved in this or any other field is likely to suggest that every practitioner in the field ought to belong to its organisation <e> <s> as i said it is unfortunate that they were not able to agree the way forward <e> <s> we believe that it is important to ensure that purchasers and vendors of property are protected from the kind of abuses that have been prevalent recently <e> <s> that is why we consider it better to proceed in the way which we now propose and upon which we have invited the views of all those who are involved <e>", "<cs> my lords the formal responsibility for considering and commenting on those matters rests with the post office users national council <e> <s> the government keep in informal touch with the post office not least because of the need to ensure that the post

people suggest <e> <s> there have been some important improvements in recent times which i very much welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier it is indeed the case that the postal service is not

mail as my noble friend describes it is posted in accordance with tariffs agreed by negotiation between the customer and the post office and is not carried at a rate which would subsidise other

however the noble lord raises an important point which is of course taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords yes this was one of the conclusions of the recent london ozone conference of which the noble lord may be aware <e> <s> the united kingdom is certainly pledged to contribute up to million dollars to the initial three-year fund <e> <s> i understand that some of that money will be used in <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that some thought is being given to that matter <e> <s> perhaps i may make further inquiries and write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is right but i also think that we must be sure that there are proper substitutes coming along if we are to ban specific substances from important uses <e> <s> however i am pleased to report that ici for example is well advanced with the development of a product called hfca which does not suffer from the objections of the other products <e> <s> a plant to produce this new substance is likely to come on stream early next year <e>", "<cs> my lords it depends on the application of the substance concerned as to what characteristics it should have <e> <s> the applications for these substances go wider than refrigeration plants but the point made by my noble friend is nonetheless a good one <e> <s> it is also important to point out that the great majority of research into this matter while in some cases supported by her majestys government is generally carried out from a commercial point of view <e> <s> the fact is that the market is now increasingly demanding that products are environmentally friendly as jargon has it and customers are clearly prepared to pay a premium for such products <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to agree that no perfect substitute has yet been found <e> <s> however i would regard a product that represented only per cent <e> <s> of the difficulties of the earlier products to be a substantial improvement <e> <s> i understand that ici for example has invested about million in developing the new product and that is very much to be applauded <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very much in favour of letting the experts in industry conduct their research free of interference from government <e> <s> however the government do have programmes as the noble lord will be aware for supporting collaborative research into these and related matters <e> <s> i do not have a figure in front of me but if i can find one i will write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is of course correct <e> <s> provided that the chemicals do not escape and eventually reach the ozone layer there is no obvious danger <e> <s> the difficulty is that at various stages of the life of the equipment it has to be overhauled and repaired and there is always a slight risk that on those occasions leaks will take place <e> <s> therefore i hope my noble friend agrees that in the fullness of time it is right for these substitutes to be replaced with less damaging products <e> <s> as i said earlier i understand that most refrigerated ships use some of the newer products so in any event there is less risk <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to respond to the noble lord lord williams i should like to say right at the outset that i fully accept that i gave an undertaking that an amendment would be brought forward and that i have not met this undertaking <e> <s> your lordships are entitled to an explanation <e>", "<cs> my lords no we are not contemplating any u-turns the noble baroness may be assured of that <e> <s> the reasons why businesses go out of business are many and varied <e> <s> some of them relate to the standard of management <e> <s> companies sometimes cease to trade for respectable reasons for example in connection with amalgamations and such matters <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is right <e> <s> the position is far from consistent across the country <e> <s> as he rightly pointed out in some areas the rate of failure is much less than it is in others <e> <s> what matters as i said earlier is the net position and the fact is that substantially more businesses are opening these days than are closing down <e>", "<cs> my lords nothing is worse for small businesses than high inflation <e> <s> it is our policy to reduce inflation through the measures that we have taken and that will be of great benefit to all industries small and large alike <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount draws your lordships attention to some interesting statistics upon which i should like to reflect if i may <e>", "<cs> my lords commission officials visited british airways on rd and th february by prior arrangement with the company <e> <s> the visit was part of the investigation of an agreement between ba klm and sabena which had been notified by the airlines to the commission under the communitys competition rules <e> <s> we have no reason to believe that the commission exceeded its powers <e> <s> if the airline wishes to make a complaint about the conduct of the visit we will follow this up <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said i do not believe that the commission officials exceeded their powers in the matter but i think that the visit was conducted in a somewhat heavy-handed way <e> <s> we hope that they will be more restrained in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said i do not believe that the commission exceeded its powers in this matter but i doubt that we have the powers that the noble lord mentions <e>", "<cs> my lords the commissions powers in this matter are set out in a regulation made under the treaty of rome which came into force in and was approved by the council of ministers at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords those powers were granted to the commission under the competition articles of the treaty of rome <e> <s> any new powers will have to be granted under whatever is the appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords i need to take further advice on that question <e> <s> it sounds to me as though the noble lord has it right <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not certain what papers were examined by the commission during the two visits which it made on consecutive days but i understand that one of bas legal representatives was on hand throughout the visit <e> <s> i presume that he satisfied himself that only the appropriate papers were examined <e>", "<cs> my lords the council of ministers has agreed as i said earlier that the commission should have certain powers in that area <e> <s> i do not believe that it exceeded its powers on that occasion but i agree that appropriate powers are correct and proper which of course is what the council agreed a couple of years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords the precise list of papers which the commission studied is not available to me because i understand that such a list is not kept <e> <s> british airways has made no complaint that incorrect papers were studied <e> <s> so far as i know the commission studied only those papers that it was entitled to see <e>", "<cs> my lords the department of trade and industry is not a party to this particular matter <e> <s> therefore the question asked by the noble lord does not arise <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not quite as simple as that <e> <s> as i understand it the position is that the commission can ask to visit premises and if the party refuses to allow admission to the premises it is the duty of the government concerned in this case the british government to make the necessary arrangements which would mean going to the court to get a writ <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe the noble lord is referring to some other kind of investigation <e> <s> i understand that a list of the documents that were inspected was not kept on this occasion although i understand that some of the personal documents of the noble lord lord king of wartnaby were in the office which the commission visited <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord <e> <s> i understand that british airways would have been perfectly willing to provide whatever documents the commission had requested <e> <s> however the commission chose nonetheless to make the visits that are the subject of this question <e> <s> that is why i said i thought the commission had acted in a rather heavy-handed way on this occasion <e> <s> however i do not think the commission exceeded its powers <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that any documents were removed <e> <s> they were inspected and in certain cases i believe they were copied <e> <s> however they were not removed <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that your lordships will allow me to say a few words in support of the bill <e> <s> i am afraid that the noble lord lord williams is right <e> <s> i gave the undertaking to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> it was a matter of very great regret to me that in the event it was not found possible to honour it in the way that i should have wished <e>"]
