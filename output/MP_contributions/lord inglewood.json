["<cs> my lords the points that i should like to raise follow much more closely the remarks of the noble baroness lady phillips than those of the noble lord who has just sat down <e> <s> i want to draw to attention what is called <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend not aware that while in the north of england great emphasis is put on christmas day and boxing day our neighbours north of the border in scotland put less emphasis on those days but a great deal more on new years day the day before it and the day after it and now the habit is growing that everything stops or is likely to stop for about days <e> <s> what are my noble friends views on that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether he is aware that however large the national heritage fund may be and however generous the countryside commission may be in a number of cases the safeguarding of our historic buildings and their contents and certain tracts of land will depend much more upon the ability of the owners who show these to the public to be enabled to he assessed under case of schedule d or some special case which her majestys government will have to define <e> <s> without proper appreciation of the taxation problems the heritage is lost <e>", "<cs> my lords it need not be concurrent provided that it happens and happens fairly regularly <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether any part of the increase about which he has spoken is likely to be directed towards civil defence <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend one question before he replies generally <e> <s> can he say whether the british transport police are entirely happy with these additional responsibilities which parliament appears to be laying upon them <e> <s> also will he bear in mind that the responsibilities of the transport police when they start going to sea are really very complicated <e> <s> because you can clash with the powers of the captain of the ship you can be in our territorial waters you can he on the high seas and you are in french territorial waters before you get to the other side and can get rid of all your troublesome football supporters <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to add my congratulations to the noble lord lord fairfax of cameron <e> <s> i think he made a good choice of subject for a maiden speech and it certainly was a good maiden speech <e> <s> i shall try not to repeat the points that have already been made in this debate but it will be difficult to keep entirely to new matter <e> <s> first i shall mention mr bevin because when passports are talked about his remark often comes to the fore and i do not think he is by any means the only one among us who has had that romantic view <e> <s> certainly many people to whom i have talked since this committee was sitting echoed his wishes and felt that probably those in charge of the different systems of control that we have at frontiers are altogether too bureaucratic <e> <s> we in the committee did not find that at all but i think that the general public believes it <e>", "<cs> my lords it horrified me too and that is why i went to a post office to check <e> <s> there is perhaps a perfectly good reason and purpose behind it but it seems to me that it is all too easy to get something which is called a passport and which has the same validity when travelling around the countries which are listed in it <e> <s> when the noble lord winds up no doubt he will be able to say something about all this <e> <s> i do not want to exaggerate or give the wrong impression but i do think that the present position invites cheating <e>", "<cs> my lords referring to the question from the noble lord lord davies of leek will my noble friend confirm that his majesty king george i never did succeed in getting his wife into this country <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that most of us in this house who have declared an interest at one time or another would prefer half a loaf to no bread <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord referred to plans which this government and their predecessor had for making the public aware of many of the factors which have to be taken into account in the case of nuclear attack <e> <s> can he tell us why nothing has yet been done to make the general public aware of what their thinking is and what they are doing about it <e> <s> is he further aware that i doubt whether there are six noble lords in this chamber now who have any idea of the thinking at easingwold or what sort of emergency plans the county councils and other are supposed to be preparing <e> <s> and time is not on our side <e>", "<cs> my lords although i am tempted to speak about the territorial army in which i served for many years including the whole of the war i want briefly to echo some things which were said about civil defence at question time on th december <e> <s> as has been stated already by the noble and gallant lord opposite there is little that can be done at the start of war unless there have been major preparations of a quite different nature from those we have today <e> <s> if you allow that there is little to be done in the first minutes there <e>", "<cs> they are unpaid <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down can he not say a few words about civil defence and particularly the police aspect of this that i mentioned because they are important and i did give warning that i should raise the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords we return now to the police bill and i rise not to make a debating speech but simply to ask the noble lord two or three questions about which i spoke to him in the lobby earlier <e> <s> the bill is drafted in very general terms so i do not think it unreasonable to ask questions as other noble lords have done <e> <s> i am glad to say that the noble lord has cleared up the question of the status of the chairman and vice-chairman but there is still the question of the size of the board and the balance between the different interests <e> <s> on occasions like this there is a great temptation for all and sundry to claim representation on the board which in the end has uncle tom cobbleigh and all as members and so becomes so large that it is very difficult to come to clear decisions much <e>", "<cs> my lords while supporting those who would like to see greater facilities for members of the european parliament may i ask a short and simple question regarding another paragraph of this report because there is more than paragraph to this report <e> <s> paragraph refers to the increase in the administration charge under the agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that his reply has vindicated many of the representations that i have been making over the last few years <e> <s> is he aware that it is extremely timely that a new committee should be set up <e> <s> is he aware too that the question made no reference to channels of representation <e> <s> it was comparing the lot of the unpaid volunteer special constabulary with that of the other members of the police force who have an entirely different form of organisation <e> <s> why should the unpaid volunteers be treated differently and less well than the others <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank my noble friend for his answers <e>", "<cs> my lords i too apologise for speaking without first putting my name down but there are a few points to which i feel i must refer and the first follows what was said by the noble lord lord davies of leek <e> <s> i live very near the scottish border on the english side differences in the legal system are important to us and i should like my noble and learned friend to say that the government are conscious of this <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble lord just one question <e> <s> it refers to a matter that was raised during the second reading debate and which was not cleared up in reply <e> <s> in fact by implication it was considered two days ago at question time <e> <s> i want to ask where the special constabulary come into this <e> <s> we hear that consideration will be given to <e>", "<cs> the noble lord could hardly be less convincing <e> <s> we all know that the special constabulary does not receive pay <e> <s> special constables volunteer to serve with a special force in exactly the same way as all other men or women joining the police service join in order to serve with one particular force <e> <s> special constables are concerned with questions of hours of duty allowances the return of police clothing and all the other factors <e> <s> i simply do not want to be fobbed off with the suggestion that chief constables look after them which frankly they have not done in the past <e> <s> i want the government to ensure that justice is done for them in this bill if not now then on report <e>", "<cs> my lords since my noble friend has shown much more understanding of the problem this week i would not wish to press him at this stage <e> <s> i would only add one sentence <e> <s> i wish he would not quote so often that the working party which reported four or so years ago included representatives of the special constabulary as if they were on an equal basis with the other members of that working party because they were not <e> <s> none the less i do not wish to pursue this at this time and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that reply which will help allay misgivings in the county and will be very gratefully received <e>", "<cs> will my noble friend allow me to ask one question <e>", "<cs> the question i wanted to ask which was intended to be helpful was this <e> <s> my noble friend referred to england and to existing railway by-laws which it is proposed should be widened and extended <e> <s> do we understand that there are no similar railway by-laws now in scotland and if there are none would it not be simpler to extend the existing by-laws to scotland now and later to look at the whole of the united kingdom together <e>", "<cs> since we have been told by the minister that a review although not a very satisfactory-sounding review is to be held and since there appears to be a difference of opinion as to how far the existing powers refer to the united kingdom how far to england and how far to scotland <e>", "<cs> could my noble friend tell us why in this bill it appears possible to make elaborate rules for taking alcohol on buses but not to put down an amendment covering railway trains <e> <s> is there some great constitutional principle here <e>", "<cs> in view of that further assurance given by my noble friend i feel that it would be wrong for us this evening to carry things further <e> <s> the front bench has confused us i do not say on purpose but they must realise that they have confused us <e> <s> it is their due to clarify this whole matter when we come to report stage <e>", "<cs> we have never disputed that the bill was designed to refer to scotland <e> <s> why i moved the amendment to widen it was because i thought that the bill as drafted would result in absurdities and be difficult to enforce <e> <s> therefore i hoped that we would find some sympathy on the front bench <e> <s> i am perfectly happy that they should say that the amendment is defective but there is a lot of time for them to put it right <e> <s> this whole attitude is a repetition of what we have seen time and time again on scottish bills and no doubt sometimes english bills too <e> <s> those who drafted the legislation have failed to realise that there is another type of administration on the other side of the border <e>", "<cs> i feel very much in agreement with the noble lord opposite who a short time ago made the point that it is not what we say or think in this house that matters it will be what is said in evidence in the court in front of magistrates or their scottish equivalent <e> <s> as i see it any constable trying to enforce this clause would have to take cognisance of a hip flask because it is a controlled container which we take great pains to describe <e> <s> it is no good our just saying that everybody will think as we do and that people are reasonable in all circumstances <e> <s> under the type of circumstances for which this clause has been drafted people are not reasonable sonic are drunk already some may well have black eyes already some may be ready to kick the shins of anyone else including a police constable who if he then sees a great bulging hip flask after he has had a slog on the shins he will immediately run the man in and will immediately run the man in and believe that all those who travel on vehicles of this sort ought to be allowed the ration of a hip flask outside the provisions of this clause surely somewhere in the clause we ought to say other than a hip flask <e> <s> i should like to think that if that is the noble lords view he will bring those words forward on report <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there is all the difference in the world between having regulations setting down acceptable limits for axle loads and having a reasonably efficient system of law enforcement to ensure that those limits are not exceeded <e> <s> at the present time there is a widespread feeling in the country that whatever may be said in the regulations those who are a little unscrupulous can get away with almost anything <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that reply may i ask whether it means that at the <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware of a very bad case in birmingham about which previous ministers have spoken in this house in which expensive machinery stood idle for months if not years because of manning difficulties <e> <s> can my noble friend say whether it is still idle or is it now working because that is a notorious example <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say when we can expect the by-law because that is important <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of my noble friends assurance that an appropriate by-law is now being considered by a variety of departments there are so many departments that i fear the speed will be very slow it would be churlish of me to press this amendment <e> <s> i did think that my amendment was much the easiest and simplest way of doing something which the government admit is worth doing <e> <s> however as they are doing something about this and i gather that they are making a genuine effort i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble and learned lord one question about what has been described as a new offence <e> <s> since vandalism on railway property is very widespread do i understand that under the interpretation clause of this bill all sworn-in constables in scotland have some standing in connection with dealing with vandalism and that that includes special constables doing service with various regular police forcesor as in other parts of the bill are the british transport police who are full-time professionals excluded <e>", "<cs> my lords the very large number of noble lords who wanted to take part in this debate shows the great width of interest and i do not think it just in this house in the subject which is increasing across the country <e> <s> it does great credit to the noble lord lord clifford of chudleigh for introducing this subject which follows the debate we had on th december on the reserve forces <e> <s> as the hour is late i intend to speak on one subject only a subject mentioned by the minister in his speech that of the police role which he described as crucial <e> <s> i spoke on th december on this same subject but as there was no home office minister on the front bench at that time i fear that there may be now some repetition <e> <s> i cannot see opposite many noble lords who could have heard the speech before and who therefore may find it a boring repetitionbut i shall try to vary the words even if the points and the questions will in the end be the same <e> <s> but this will be the <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first apologise for not putting my name down until so late in the day <e> <s> i live in the area of the eden district council if not in the area of the east fellside experiment so i am to some extent one of the natives about whom this report has been writtenand an excellent report it is and very timely <e> <s> i was also once member of parliament for westmorland and therefore in contact with umex and which are also familiar to the noble lord lord peart who was a constituency neighbour <e> <s> we both know the area which has been chosen and i think it is a very good area for these experiments <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me will he not also mention that we have a very good inn and that he himself has patronised it on a number of occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords following the last supplementary question may i ask my noble friend whether the shortfall of in the police includes the special constabulary <e> <s> i think not but if not <e> <s> why did he not tell the house what was that shortfall <e>", "<cs> my lords not having put my name down on the list of speakers i shall try to be very brief and not repeat what other noble lords have said <e> <s> i have had the experience of being both a manager and for many years chairman of the type of small school about which the noble lord lord polwarth has spoken <e> <s> that school was founded years ago and endowed by people of the parish and has been of immense importance to this small scattered community for that length of time <e> <s> it was paid for by the local people out of their own pockets and they even put a little aside leaving us with a small endowment <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the remarks about wages in the hotel and catering <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend spoke of unstarred questions as occasions when noble lords might wish to raise a debate on a special question <e> <s> would he not agree that the procedure for unstarred questions means that the minister speaks at the end <e> <s> no noble lord has a chance of questioning the minister on anything he says about government policy and he in fact has a safe escape route at the end of the unstarred question debate and that is not the point of a defence debate <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend say something about the figure of <e> <s> does all of that represent overtime <e> <s> could he also say what happens in those districts of london from which large numbers of police were drawn for this purpose <e> <s> since we have so few organised reserves were they left wide open to the petty thieves <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lord lord kilbracken because in every town in this country there are countless examples of unhealthy trees and trees which were planted in the wrong place <e> <s> under the terms of the bill it seems that that mistake which was made by a previous generation has to be made again when any reasonable forester would much prefer in the light of experience <e>", "<cs> i am in some difficulty here i do not know if i am the only noble lord who is <e> <s> as the noble lord lord kilbracken said it is not so difficult to identify a self-sown sycamore growing through the cracks at the side of a road as being three years old or so <e> <s> he <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e> <s> like the noble baronesss bill this bill is short and clear and meets a real need <e> <s> it passed through all its stages during the last parliament and <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise only to thank noble lords who have supported this bill so generously and who also have said such kind things about me <e> <s> i did not start describing what happens when you break a glass or break a bottle and put in in somebody elses face as i thought other noble lords would almost certainly do so <e> <s> i was not disappointed for they have spoken about it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that water authorities are becoming increasingly arrogant and powerful and that we could save a great deal of water in this country if the government encouraged re-cycling policies <e>", "<cs> my lords accepting that under the law the terms of service in the police for men and women are the same and that there are many jobs where women are better than men is my noble friend aware that many senior police officers in this country are far from satisfied with the present position <e> <s> would he bear in mind that women are just as expensive to train as are men on average serve for a considerably shorter period and that the whole question of the service of women police constables alongside men is a subject which could be looked into again possibly by the police advisory board <e>", "<cs> my lords is that answer not irrelevant <e> <s> i have already said that for many jobs women were better than men <e> <s> it could be that they ride horses better <e> <s> the fact remains that there is considerable disquiet among a number of senior police officers in the service about the present legal position <e> <s> will my noble friend look into this again <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord referred to ministers who did not know where they were going <e> <s> during that period parliamentary secretaries i would submit did know where they were going <e> <s> it is a pity that ministers did not listen to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend agree that this emotional issue can easily be exaggerated and that it does not seem quite so simple to men out on the street who are responsible for enforcing the law and preventing crime just to repeal these provisions without something being worked out which will in fact give them the necessary powers to do their job <e> <s> before the government come to a decision can we be sure that they will consult with those who have this responsibility not just with the representatives of the most senior grades of the police service but with all ranks and not least those who may find themselves out alone in the dark carrying this heavy responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that reply will he pay attention to this question in future because nothing creates ill will more easily in a border area like the counties on either side of the scottish border than that subsistence allowances or travelling expenses should be different whether one happens to live on one side or the other <e> <s> there are plenty of examples where the administration has brought such conditions about <e> <s> i am glad to see that the noble lord lord peart is nodding his head in agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that this advisory committee which has done such good work over very many years could well be taken by other members of the european community as an example of how this task can well and inexpensively be carried out <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be tempting as an original member of the historic buildings council to follow the noble lord opposite even if i am not as good as he is at the latin language but i am going to resist this temptation because it is late <e> <s> i want to make one point and i promise i shall not be more than two minutes if i cannot make it in one <e> <s> if the government are really anxious to reduce central control over expenditure on small items of routine administration by local authorities i should like to ask this <e> <s> why is there no reference in the bill to the multitude of trivial controls by the home office over the expenditure on activities of police authorities even down to alterations to buildings and individual police houses which i would rate as no more than routine estate management <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of that not very satisfactory reply i should like to ask my noble friend whether he does not agree with me that at a time when we are trying to get rid of class distinctions the maintenance of this distinction on the paper is really absurd <e> <s> further can he confirm that not so long ago when one of these photo identity cards was issued to the wife of a noble and learned lord a former lord chancellor and the authorities of the house asked <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for having explained much more clearly than he did in committee not only what is actually happening now but what he hopes will happen in the future <e> <s> i still think it would be very much better if he accepted this series of amendments and if the drafting were found to be imperfect that could be put right by third reading <e> <s> however in the light of what he said it would be ungenerous of me to ask the house to divide today <e> <s> nevertheless i urge my noble friend to draw the attention of his right honourable friend to the fact that of the speeches here today there has not been one other than in support of my amendment although there were some reservations on the part of the noble baroness lady stedman <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to my noble friend my lords <e> <s> i feel finally that i must reply to the minister on the question of certain classes of expenditure over which it would be right for the secretary of state to retain control <e> <s> he will have seen that in one of the two new draft schedules which i have tabled i have said that classes of expenditure could be prescribed and that would exactly allow communications or other equipment to be exempted from any general relief <e> <s> as i said in the light of the ministers declared intentions i will seek leave to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> however i must say that if in practice things do not work out as he has indicated i shall return to this point at the first opportunity and next time i will not withdraw <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to make several general points and to seek more information about clause which may not be quite so innocent as is claimed <e> <s> i shall be short and i also say that i am not other than a convinced supporter of the need for a bill of this nature at this unhappy time <e> <s> i am very glad that the great majority of the provisions are short-term but it is the habit of governments to use an emergency to tag things on to rushed bills of this kind which failed to find places in some earlier enactment <e> <s> clause which increases police powers with no limit of time seems to be out of keeping with our british tradition and it is something which i think parliament should look at closely <e>", "<cs> it seems to me the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor is rather simplifying this issue <e> <s> it is something that will not end at the end of the month <e> <s> it refers to something being practicable <e> <s> if i understood the noble and learned lord aright he has in mind a repetition of some sort of crisis which means that prisons are full and there is no place for men to be delivered <e> <s> in fact i can see other reasons <e> <s> if a police force is greatly under strength and the distance that the man has to go to prison is an extremely long distance there is every reason why he might be detained for a day or two until other men return from leave or for some other reason which would enable him to be sent perhaps miles or more when it would be far less inconvenient <e> <s> i do not accept that this is simply a power which we should associate with the sort of difficult situation we are now in <e>", "<cs> in clarification of what the noble lord lord belstead said in his second reading speech in reply to something i asked may i ask him to be a little more explicit about a police authoritys rights to enter police premises <e> <s> i did not mean in the middle of the day having a look to see whether new roofs are necessary or the outside or inside needed repainting <e> <s> i meant to ask who if anybody had a right to enter at any time of day he liked and maybe late at night when cell passages are filling up <e> <s> i understood his reply to mean that it was in fact the case <e> <s> if it is so i can think of a number of chief constables who will be absolutely furious <e>", "<cs> my lords having spoken on similar amendments at a previous stage i should like to say a few words <e> <s> whereas i support the latter part of the speech just made by the noble baroness dealing with property and maintenance and the amount of work which is still going to be put on local authorities in order to follow this new so-called relaxed procedure i am not happy about the abolition of the home office control over the most senior appointments <e> <s> in this country of ours we are lucky to be very free of corruption but on the other hand there is always a chance that a local favourite before a selection committee gets priority because <e>", "<cs> my lords the term bucket shop which is no compliment is being bandied around <e> <s> can the noble lord tell us what is the difference between a bucket shop and a legitimate retail outlet so that the simpler of us know when we go to buy an air ticket exactly what we are doing <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to make provision with respect to the sale of intoxicating liquor in off-licenced premises to attach conditions to the grant or renewal of certain justices off-licences to prohibit the employment of persons under where intoxicating liquor is sold and for connected purposes <e> <s> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend one question concerned with finance which is whether before they issue this circular they will review the fact that at present per cent only of the cost of civil defence is met by central government even though much of that expenditure is not of a local sort and that in consequence some local authorities are holding back <e> <s> further will he confirm when he talks of the team being doubled that in most counties it is six or less <e> <s> finally will he not agree that the question by the noble lord lord brockway and the supplementary questions and answers which followed <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to speak about one point only <e> <s> it involves tens of millions rather than hundreds or thousands of millions but none the less i submit that it is important because it affects the general public as well as passengers staff and customers <e> <s> i refer to the policing of road and rail systems in this country something that affects us all <e> <s> the road network is policed by the county forces with per cent <e> <s> of the cost recovered from the central government <e> <s> the railway network docks and harbours were policed traditionally by a number of different forces that are now formed into one highly efficient force the british transport police with the cost borne wholly by the british railways board with contributions from docks and from london transport <e> <s> i saw in a paper the other day that it is estimated that in this year the cost will be million <e> <s> it is of course still rising and it would rise faster if the establishment were increased <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> this bill i submit is not just short in length but is also big in merit <e> <s> it contains just two proposals one in each of its two clauses and it follows the line of a debate in this house in october <e> <s> it is designed to tidy up a small corner of the jungle of our licensing laws and i shall explain in a minute in more detail <e> <s> it is not the intention to swing sales of drink from one set of outlets to another <e> <s> may i say too at the beginning of this short speech that since the bill was printed i have had letters from individuals including the chairman of a well-known football club and organisations all in support and i have heard very little from the other side <e>", "<cs> my lords the second reading debate on this small bill has developed into a general debate on alcoholism and although many of the speeches had very little reference to what was actually in the bill they have all contributed to what i hope will be considered by others who are not here tonight if they read this debate to have been a useful occasion <e>", "<cs> despite what the noble baroness lady david has said we should at this time put in schedule all those plants which we feel are in danger <e> <s> the suggestion that by putting more rather than fewer on the list we are weakening the whole position is i believe false <e> <s> i support my noble friend <e> <s> it is not often that someone who lives near the southern side of the border has the opportunity wholeheartedly of supporting some scottish interest but on this occasion i do <e> <s> we should be careful to ensure that when the bill leaves us the list is complete and does not have items left off it just because by putting them on it would be longer than some optimum in certain peoples heads <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for the full reply <e> <s> bearing in mind police loyalty and pride in their service would not the noble lord agree that it is not much of a compliment nor much help to morale to bracket the achievements of a fine force with more exacting initial training than any other force in this country under a heading <e>", "<cs> may i say one word in support of the noble lord lord winstanley <e> <s> barrow-in-furness is in the county of cumbria where i live and i think that the enterprise which they have shown by suggesting that this new clause should be included if not in the cumbria bill at least in this bill is to be commended <e> <s> as the noble lord has just said it is very important that we should bear in mind that in parts of this area the question of public access is not important because there is a tradition that people have access to virtually the whole countryside <e> <s> the difficulty is that there are so many people at certain times of the year in some areas of the lake district and the surroundings that that area is threatened with damage <e> <s> it is important to consider here that the authorities concerned should have a chance of making sensible by-laws where such conditions exist <e> <s> it may or may not be entirely true in practice as the noble lord on the front bench has explained to us <e> <s> i rise only to ask him to look at this again <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the noble lord lord winstanley and to say that i think there is very little if anything between the sponsors of these different amendments <e> <s> if we want to follow the advice of the noble lord the chief whip and really make progress the noble lord on the front bench has only to nod and show that he accepts the principle behind these amendments and i am sure that we should be able to reduce our remarks to very little or nothing and get on to the next group of amendments <e> <s> shall i give him the chance <e>", "<cs> i have not finished i am sorry to say but since the noble lord the minister is not prepared to nod i assume that he is going to say that part if not the whole is unacceptable <e> <s> and if so i shall ask him to look at this again before the report stage <e>", "<cs> not all of them only about half <e>", "<cs> no i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but i was looking at a map to check whether i was correct about the cotswolds <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall not move it <e>", "<cs> i should like to add a few words <e> <s> there is other limestone in these areas besides limestone taken from a limestone pavement <e> <s> secondly i do not think that this point is quite as clear as the others <e> <s> not to allow any tolerance at all seems to me to be unreasonable but since there is at times such financial advantage in despoiling these pavements <e>", "<cs> may i ask for an explanation before the noble lord replies <e> <s> in the north-west area we have had trouble over generations because of lake thirlmere which is a very important reservoir <e> <s> there has been on the part of all the nature and amenity organisations a wish that the public should get greater access and greater enjoyment from what could be a wonderful asset <e> <s> we are always hearing about jam tomorrow but we never have jam today <e> <s> will this amendment give us jam today <e>", "<cs> my lords as the hour is late i shall be brief and i hope your lordships will forgive me if my speech seems disjointed i have cut out of my notes all parts which will be equally appropriate to the second reading debate when the forestry bill comes before the house <e> <s> those of us who recall forestry debates and problems directly after the war and i am glad to see the noble lord lord peart in his place must have great satisfaction today in view of the great progress that has been made in the intervening years not just in rebuilding our woods which were devastated by the war but in widening the knowledge and appreciation not only of woodland management by professionals but of general appreciation through <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> this bill is one of a familiar series in the review of local government legislation required under section of the local government act <e> <s> a number of these bills have already been before your lordships house <e> <s> this bill substantially re-enacts existing powers and where appropriate includes common clauses <e> <s> as can be expected some clauses deal with matters of special interest to the county and it is inevitable that some petitions in this case four have been laid but i submit that they will properly be dealt with in the committee stage if not settled before and it is the promoters hope that some if not all will be settled before <e>", "<cs> my lords since i live in the county of cumbria which is concerned and that area is particularly important i rise very briefly to support the noble lord <e> <s> this is a very simple provision and is not covered by access agreements as was suggested in the governments reply at committee stage <e> <s> the sssis in the neighbourhood of barrow-in-furness can very easily be destroyed by access just as historic houses can easily be destroyed by the feet of those thousands who come and visit them <e> <s> i should like the government to consider this again if not before the next stage at least when the bill conies before another <e>", "<cs> my lords full of hope i agree with what my noble friend has advised the house and i think that there is little more for me to say other than that i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords after such valuable and distinguished support i certainly do not want to prolong the rivalry between different factions which began to appear in these i thought innocent debates <e> <s> so far as i can see my amendment puts the emphasis on the county and not on the local planning authority but i am prepared to leave it to the government when it comes to drafting a final version <e> <s> the noble viscount lord ridley spoke freely about a certain county appointing curious officers <e> <s> i do not know whether that is the way it happens in northumberland but i am sure it is not the habit of the county which is more intimately concerned with this clause <e>", "<cs> my lords it surprises me that this innocent amendment should have aroused such intense rivalry <e> <s> i am not sure the noble lord lord hunt is correct <e> <s> i thought the tolerance allowed by the general development order was for agricultural purposes only and not for extraction in such quantities that it was worth transporting all over the country for rockeries <e> <s> that to the best of my belief is not allowed under the general development order <e> <s> as between the different points of view expressed on the benches opposite i am sorry to disappoint the noble baroness lady david and although it may seem ungallant i intend to take the view of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a long time since i served my time and passed my exams as an agricultural surveyor but i think i can still tell <e> <s> as for the rivalry between the two points of view on the benches opposite on this occasion not least because the minister has come so far in our direction on the main point of our case i shall take a course of action which will not deprive the noble baroness of a series of other opportunities in another place and i therefore beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no intention of depriving the noble baroness of two votes not one on the amendment remembering that we are speaking at the same time to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> in the circumstances i will if your lordships wish withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend that bearing in mind the ever-increasing mobility of the criminal population whatever he may do to make it easier for law-abiding citizens to arrive in and depart from this country he will not make it easier for wanted persons either to come in or to leave <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend one short question in the interests of clarity <e> <s> if he cannot do it now will he at the committee stage make quite clear not just the relation between sus and the new clause but also between the stop search and detain provisions in the metropolitan police act and one or two other acts in this country and the new clause <e> <s> one does not want a grey area where police constables do not know what they are doing <e> <s> they must have an absolutely clear picture otherwise we shall have the same ill-will building up again <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad that the noble lord lord allen has raised this subject because it is very timely <e> <s> i should have liked to take up some of the arguments of the noble lord lord plant <e> <s> i agree with some of what he said though not all of it but i think that at this time of the evening i ought to stick to the notes that i have prepared and speak about accountability which is one of the points raised by the noble lord lord allen <e> <s> accountability has for long been a grey area a great uncertainty and i hope that the home office will take the point and act where possible to clear up uncertainties <e>", "<cs> but not in london <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether the ability of a salesman to speak a foreign language is a non-price factor <e>", "<cs> i have sympathy for much that the noble baroness has said but i did not think that the picture she painted was the picture of britain today <e> <s> the time may come when the people in this country share the same sort of feelings that the germans have which is almost a mystic interest in their woods <e> <s> it is a country where people go out in thousands every weekend <e> <s> that is not the case in this country <e> <s> none the less i think it is our responsibility to see that access and the sort of opportunities that the noble baroness spoke about are not unduly restricted <e> <s> i should like to see the word equivalent here as far as access is concerned <e> <s> when one is dealing with any sort of estate or forest management it is often inconvenient to have an ancient footpath running in a certain line when there would be little hindrance or inconvenience if it were to be moved <e> <s> i should like to think of the use of the word equivalent <e>", "<cs> did we not have a debate on clause stand part <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend confirm that allowing this rather unsavoury inquiry to drag on for so long gives the impression of some cover-up particularly to that part of the public which seeks every excuse to attack the police no mattter how unjustly <e> <s> further considering the size of this problem and the length of time it has been with us may i ask him to ask his right honourable friend to tell us more and see whether the investigation can be hastened and brought to an early conclusion <e>", "<cs> i think it is a pity that this debate should be continued entirely by distinguished lawyers because this is a subject which does have an interest for a great many people who have not held high judicial office and who have not known the inner workings of the system <e> <s> nobody in this chamber could say that i am not on the side of law and order considering the number of speeches i have made over the years but i must say i am not entirely happy about the speech of the minister <e> <s> i did not find myself convinced that this was a subject which should be begun and ended as an administrative matter <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend not agree that a vast improvement in the general conduct of the scotland-england match in london a fortnight ago was due to the better control of the sale of alcohol and the banning of alcohol on trains something for which this house ought to take credit considering how this was pressed during the committee stage of a bill about a year ago <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two points i should like to raise with the noble lord <e> <s> in one clause a very wide power to make by-laws is given to the authorities and that is no doubt necessary but some of the provisions for instance clause <e>", "<cs> this is one of the most difficult questions dealing with the drink and driving issue that we have to discuss and it is made even more difficult because of the fact that we have to discuss two amendments at the same time and just to make it more complicated we have to consider the possible implications of scottish law <e> <s> from the point of view <e>", "<cs> i should like to reinforce what the noble lord has just said and ask the noble lord the minister to confirm or otherwise that we are now making it possible for all the -odd police forces in this country to have different procedures if they want to and in fact to use different machines <e> <s> at present one of the great difficulties in the british police system is that the independence of the different police forces means that they can use different equipment <e> <s> there is no reason to say that different equipment may not in the great majority of cases arrive at acceptable and correct solutions to whatever problem they may face <e> <s> but here we have probably the most difficult situation where misunderstanding can arise between the police and the public <e>", "<cs> when my noble friend says they have budgeted accordingly may i ask him to say what it will cost in the first year <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise for one minute only to support the noble lord lord sandford and to say that i wish his amendment were stronger <e> <s> i am one of those who from the very beginning has had reservations about clause of this bill not reservations about selling fringe land and selling land in accordance with the normal processes of estate management but about seeing an open-ended commitment like this in the bill <e> <s> before i sit down i am going to ask the minister to remember just one thing and that is that forestry timber and amenity interests all over the country are united i would say or the great majority of them are in disliking this clause <e> <s> i therefore beg my noble friend to accept this amendment and to go further than just giving assurances and putting letters in the library <e>", "<cs> i should like to refer to enforcement <e> <s> it has been mentioned three times and i feel that the difficulty of enforcement has rather been swept aside <e> <s> it is irrelevant to compare the enforcement over seat belts with a check when the car is stationary to see whether the windscreen wiper works or not <e>", "<cs> my lords in looking at this clause i have tried to think the whole time of the difficulties of enforcement and the short debate that we have just been listening to brings out how great difficulties could in fact emerge from what seems a very small point just a very few words being added or not added to the bill <e> <s> i should like to put in a plea here that if the words reasonable excuse are not considered by the lawyers to be adequate to meet my noble friends very proper point as i think it to be then i should like to appeal to the government that when it comes to the drafting of the regulations they should take very great trouble over this point and if necessary even go to some length in describing what might or might not be the sort of points argued frequently before magistrates courts and not only in magistrates courts a very long way from the capital as the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter cynically mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords may i be allowed to move my amendment <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord on the front bench who has virtually said he has accepted the first part of it <e>", "<cs> but my lords my noble friend has accepted the principle of it which is repeated in a later amendment where he prefers lord nugents words <e> <s> having heard the noble lord lord bellwin i would not want to say anything else on that point and i shall not move amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i follow up by moving amendment no <e> <s> a which is a new point and a short one <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me that through all these debates ministers only have half an idea of the difficulties of enforcement <e> <s> of course it is going to be difficult for them to discover what these problems are in this country because we have naturally this distinction between the legislature and the executive <e> <s> if they are in any doubt about the problems which are going to arise i suggest that our ministers should swallow their pride because it will be very difficult to get any police force in england to agree with them about this and furthermore they will of course be easy to identify and should go to the capital of one of our neighbouring countries and go out with the police where this legislation is now in effect <e> <s> they should be taken out and shown the difficulties on the ground <e> <s> at the present moment in this country it is not possible to do that because the law is not yet in operation <e> <s> i have a little practical experience behind me in saying this and i am certain that there is a great deal of difference between imagining what happens and what happens in practice <e>", "<cs> my lords following what the noble lord lord shinwell said would not my noble friend agree that if any government are to be criticised for lack of foresight in the training organisation and equipping of our police it should be the previous government who did so little when the signs were so clear <e> <s> would not my noble friend also agree that <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming the noble lords statement which is a great deal better than the very weak statement on the same subject which was issued as a press handout after a meeting not long ago may i ask that while speed is obviously important here we should see no panic because what is necessary is considerable study to make up for the wasted years during which not enough attention has been paid to the whole question of street disorder and the means which are necessary to combat it which ought to have been apparent to us from what we have seen on the continent <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that his answer appeared to reveal that the home office was reluctant about following up this research <e> <s> the problem is very urgent and a great deal is known about it <e> <s> can he not confirm that the tradition in this country going back to the earliest times is that the people themselves were very largely responsible for policing <e>", "<cs> my lords may i revert to the question of damage and ask the noble lord whether the full report contains any pictures of this damage about which so much criticism has been made or if there are no pictures in the report whether his right honourable friend has seen any pictures <e> <s> will he not agree with me that while some damage is unavoidable when breaking into premises when speed is the essence of the question and there are cupboards and doors to be broken down in quick time it is extremely easy for young men with the adrenalin running and realising that somebody may get hurt in the short time that they have to do the job to do excessive damage <e> <s> this surely could much best be now judged if photographs had been taken immediately <e> <s> perhaps this is one of the lessons that he says the police learned from the operation <e> <s> some effort might well be made to have a photographic unit included in a sensitive major operation of this kind in future <e>", "<cs> my lords at this hour i think that it is too late to make a speech with closely reasoned argument but i should like to make two brief points on the subject of law enforcement about which there has been reference in very general terms during this debate apparently taking law enforcement for granted as against all the figures and details on the other subjects like the prison population child delinquents and so on into which we have gone in some depth <e> <s> i hope that when we come to debate the scarman report we shall get well below the surface because in my view this house more so than the other place ought to be able to help the police service in its present difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords from what <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend a question about consultation which is something which professional policemen do not happily accept <e> <s> may i ask my noble friend to give us an assurance that he does intend these consultations to be real <e> <s> where they happen in other countries where they have been in existence since the war there is considerable disappointment and in england at present there are virtually none <e>", "<cs> my lords could my noble friend confirm that he disagrees wholeheartedly with the efforts of many of the political friends of the noble lord opposite who has asked the question that civil defence expenditure and effort should be run down <e>", "<cs> it has been reduced in some counties <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may intervene the ordinary citizen knows practically nothing of police authorities all over england <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad indeed to speak following the noble lord lord harris of greenwich not least because we have both taken part in debates on a number of occasions where the police has been an important subject and although we have not always agreed one thing we have in common is that we both have a great interest in the police service <e> <s> i have been long interested in police problems and from speeches i have made in your lordships house many noble lords will know that i have had a close association with the police and one of the reasons why i have maintained that close association is that i have felt trouble was coming <e> <s> i look on s misfortunes not as a great surprise but to some extent as a harvest of wasted years so little preparation did we make in the face of the many warning lights <e> <s> i have never served as a regular police officer but i have had that long association and i wish to pay tribute to the help i have received from several police forces in this country some of them much more forthcoming than others but no names no disciplinary charges <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell us how this figure of is calculated and what it is supposed to cover because it seems remarkably unrealistic <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down could he refer briefly to one important point <e> <s> are the proposals which he is asking us to accept bringing the law in scotland nearer to the law in other parts of the united kingdom or taking them further away <e> <s> this is important bearing in mind the very large deer population in the border areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to refer briefly to a point i raised when my noble friend lord glenarthur was speaking and that is the cross-border implications of the bill <e> <s> not for the first time in your lordships house i have had to make a mild protest that those who drafted a bill seem to think scotland is an island it is not <e> <s> it has a land frontier at the southern end and there are a great many deer in that area which cross the boundary without let or hindrance <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether there are many prison hospitals in this country which have the facilities to give worthwhile treatment to mentally disordered offenders <e>", "<cs> my lords could my noble friend tell us approximately what is a small firm and what is a medium sized firm under consideration here <e>", "<cs> may i support my noble friends amendment <e> <s> i know all the arguments as between a negative and a positive resolution and in my day have had to argue them <e> <s> i think that the speech which we have just heard is very much common form <e> <s> on the other hand the substance of this section is not common form it is the wider use of firearms and their control at a time when most of us would like there to be less use of firearms <e> <s> therefore i feel that with regard not only to the general principle but to the timing too it is important that this house should have closer control over what is proposed in this section <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble friend who has introduced this bill has sufficiently pondered the difficulties of policing the provisions under this and certain other clauses <e> <s> scotland is a large place but the population is very thin on the ground <e> <s> the members of the police force are stationed at very wide intervals and therefore there is ample scope for people of ill-intention to poach <e> <s> they are able to use almost any weapon they like with only the smallest likelihood of being caught and checked <e> <s> unless and until there can be quite a different enforcement pattern in scotland the only pattern i can see is that the special constabulary should be greatly increased in these areas i believe there is going to be a great deal of additional poaching under this bill and very little check on it <e>", "<cs> i was being tactful <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl keep me right by saying how far this overstatement is admitted <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend spoke of good progress as if all counties and authorities were active in this direction <e> <s> can he say what action the government propose to take where a county council such as cumbria has brought all civil defence planning to an end <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a very great responsibility to follow the noble and learned lord lord scarman in a police debate <e> <s> first i should like to <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness agree that our cathedral choirs and the wonderful tradition particularly of boys singing and they are trained in special private schools is something which is the envy of europe <e> <s> she did not mention that when speaking of the opera <e> <s> they started long before the arts council was ever heard of <e>", "<cs> my lords in his answer the noble lord referred to scotland as well as to england <e> <s> may i ask him whether the contents of the scottish circular are the same as the contents of the english circular <e> <s> because it is important from the point of view of local authorities that the administrative arrangements on both sides of the border especially in operational issues like these should be exactly the same <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord allow me to interrupt <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not at all upset <e> <s> but quite apart from the shuddering would the noble lord not think that there is a great problem here <e> <s> if he stood on the pavement edge at the corner of bridge street and parliament square as i hope the minister will be able to say he has done how long is it before his feet are run over or his legs are broken <e>", "<cs> my lords could my noble friend say what scope there is for volunteers to take part in the defence of these key targets <e> <s> we shall never have enough professionals <e>", "<cs> my lords while agreeing wholeheartedly with my noble friend that it would be disastrous <e>", "<cs> my lords at this hour i do not rise to make a speech but to make one point only and i would not be doing this except that i was a member of the british delegation to the world food congress in <e> <s> in fact i was the leader <e> <s> what i should like to say is this <e> <s> the speeches we have heard here today reflect very closely the speeches which i heard made in parliament shortly after that congress in with one difference and one difference only and that is that we can all speak openly about family planning whereas then everyone was rather furtive about it whatever he might think <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not agree that in spite of those reasons or excuses which he has just given it is very deplorable that over years when the need for a disciplined special constabulary to aid with civil defence if not for other purposes has become greater year by year the home office and chief constables together have been so complacent about this annual drop in numbers <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not agree that the use of special constables is not just a question of younger men on the beat <e> <s> there is also advantage in older men bringing a different variety of experience to the police service which they otherwise have not got <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend confirm that what is really important is that the occupant of this chair should be the best available man and not the first available man <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend because i do not think he has yet made it clear whose band this was and which was the building in whitehall <e> <s> while not disputing that the police have to make difficult decisions all the time would he not agree that this was the sort of occasion about which surely members of this house are entitled to seek information <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that while not wishing to see delay on this matter many of us would like to see a democratic solution based on the wishes of the majority of the people which is likely to endure <e> <s> the last thing we want to see is a hasty solution with a marxist backing which is <e>", "<cs> my lords in these very few sentences i shall not make a speech in the ordinary sense of the word <e>", "<cs> my lords first i must apologise for misunderstanding the arrangements for filling the gap and in these few sentences which are not a speech i should like to say that i am not violently pro- or anti-israel of pro- or anti- the plo but i am unashamedly pro-lebanon a country i cannot say that i have known well for years like the noble viscount but i did live there for a year at the end of the war and i have been there a number of times since <e> <s> i have over those times visited camps within the city boundary of beirut and i have appreciated that as a result of those camps the authorities in the city of beirut were not masters of their own destiny <e> <s> what was happening in those camps i do not know <e> <s> i was advised by the british embassy not to go but my wife and i went all the same <e> <s> i admit that the atmosphere therein was anything but pleasant <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad we have been given the chance this evening to return to the question of civil defence <e> <s> it was about a year ago that we debated it at some length and it is time to do it again and i am glad that my noble friend has given us this chance <e> <s> i want to leave the more general questions <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend <e> <s> at last my lords have found someone who thinks he knows what the statutory minimum is <e> <s> when answering at question time not long ago a minister led me and no doubt others to believe that there were no clear defaulters among the county councils although some had done more than others <e> <s> i should like him to confirm this sometime because there is a feeling in the country that some county councils have done virtually nothing <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that at this time when hotel receipts like those of many other industries are tending to fall there is understandable fear in the industry that the review of the development areas of which my noble friend has spoken will result in large parts of this country where the tourist and hotel industry is important being excluded from the help they have had over recent years <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether when he says accordingly he intends to supersede the powers in various private acts giving to certain police forces in this country the power to stop search and detain <e> <s> in addition will he ensure that whatever powers are included will be national rather than local and will go further than just searching for offensive weapons following the lines of the metropolitan police acts which were primarily concerned with stolen property <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to be brief and i would like to back up the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale because i think that the questions he has raised this evening are so important <e> <s> but against this background what are we now to think against what happened last week when we had a demonstration on the other side of parliament square and we had the secretary of state and the commissioner shouted down at a police meeting <e> <s> apparently that has passed overlooked by many i think it is a very very important indication <e> <s> but not noise <e> <s> what i wish we had had was a little more original thought under caps with chequered bands instead of just noise during that meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend to make it clear that the government really want to see consultation machinery in operation in other parts of england or is it as appears from what he has said to be only in the metropolitan police area <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult to follow the previous speaker when the subject is as wide as home and social affairs <e> <s> however i believe i have found a link in the field in which the noble baroness has been working <e> <s> i have talked about the voluntary and professional elements which are needed to help one another in this field because neither can work alone without the help of the other <e> <s> i must again say that in these many services we need professionals and volunteers <e> <s> we want to narrow the gap between the two fields if we can do so <e> <s> we want to avoid the professionals looking down on volunteers and amateurs which all too often happens particularly in this technical age in which we live <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to give us more information about the scale <e> <s> can he say that the majority of men now recruited into what we call task forces of different kinds no matter what the name might be have been issued with the necessary equipment and have had the necessary training <e> <s> will he make a special point of this and let us know that it is not just a question of issuing new equipment but also of giving the necessary training <e>", "<cs> my lords would there not be fewer accidents if these vehicles did not travel at such excessive speeds as many of them do and then tend to go out of control <e> <s> is my noble friend satisfied that there are some police forces in this country where it appears that this law is not enforced <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the noble baroness and to ask a question although i must admit that i am confused and i suspect that others are too by the wording of this clause and the legislation by reference in the amendment <e> <s> my one question is very simple is it clear that at present general medical practitioners can be called generally doctors are entitled to be <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend able to let me know who pays for the very extravagant police power that one sees at football matches <e> <s> is it the clubs which pay or does the cost even at overtime rates come out of the normal vote <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that the numbers of men who are posted to football grounds to police the matches tend to leave large areas of cities and surrounding areas blank <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend was not able to give a very satisfactory answer to my first question may i ask whether he is aware that over the season police escorts must be provided on something <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late hour may i make a general plea for the case which has been made this evening by the noble lord lord todd and other speakers <e> <s> at the same time may i make one special point <e> <s> we must not risk losing one side of our work <e> <s> comparable establishments abroad have worked very closely with us and we hope that they will look towards us in the future as they have done in the past <e> <s> however i doubt whether some of the suggested changes will necessarily leave us in the same position of strength <e> <s> these

that it needs nor can every country cover the whole of this field of research <e> <s> we want all these different institutions to work closely together for the common good <e> <s> when the princes risborough laboratory closes and is given another form we must be sure that we do not lose one side of that very important work <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that my noble friend is a sympathetic person

competition particularly at ports of entry such as dover where members of the staff customs officers and even policemen can speak a language other than english and whether having reached a certain standard they should not then be entitled to wear a badge indicating to visitors that those members of the staff speak their language which will assist in the quick passage of travellers through the station <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords do we know what other countries have any system which is at all comparable

alcohol is almost intractable <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend please tell me who in fact has overall command of this force in the lebanon which is made up of the armed forces of a number of different countries <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also ask whether there is any particular emphasis on the question of training and whether in fact these men are composed of a number of different training teams <e> <s> if so is there any special role for them in that line <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord a simple question to clear up the point that he makes <e> <s> the noble lord was speaking about doctors perhaps parting with information that comes their way because an administrator in the home office may require something of that kind <e> <s> has he made clear the position of the police who are in a difficult situation and who under the terms of the bill can be put in an extremely dangerous position <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether these consultations are concerned with the <e>", "<cs> my lords i must resist the temptation to go further into the viewing of the noble baroness and her relations <e> <s> i think that instead i ought to stick to the advice of the most reverend primate the archbishop <e> <s> his speech was so wide-ranging and so helpful that at this time of the evening it is probably better if i speak very briefly about one topic that he raised and only one <e> <s> it is the role of the police which has been mentioned only very few times during the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend one short question which should have a very easy answer <e> <s> having been president of one of the regional boards at the very beginning of this organisation i am naturally interested <e> <s> may i ask whether or not there is to be any change in these local boards <e>", "<cs> my lords in giving the increase in tourists coming to this country can my noble friend say whether there are figures to show the stream of british tourists in the other direction and whether on balance there is an advantage in the foreign currency earned <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord not agree with me that a large amount of police time is wasted by ill-maintained burglar alarms which go off by chance and through their faulty state of repair causing the police to be drawn from a considerable distance to answer false alarms <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say what proportion of fines imposed today are in fact never paid <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that it is not often easy to assess how large demonstrations or processions will be and how many people will be participating and therefore it is necessary to ensure an adequate police presence <e> <s> does not my noble friend also agree that once it is apparent that the numbers are not as large as expected the police are slow to stand down their very large numbers of reserves and this sometimes lies behind the difficulty in this connection <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say generally whether diplomats vehicles are treated any <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say who in fact is responsible for the enforcement of these provisions <e> <s> we know that the police are responsible to a certain extent but my noble friend also referred to enforcement officers <e> <s> who are they <e> <s> are there sufficient <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend please confirm not only that we had a flow of vehicles per -hour period as was mentioned but that even though he referred to a modest increase in traffic density on that road the figure calculated only a few weeks ago was an increase of per cent <e> <s> which is far beyond the modest increase which the minister has just mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to say one word of respect and admiration to the police for the way they carried out their duties in the midlands over the past few weeks <e> <s> public order must be very exacting duties rather like exasperation and boredom and a little fear thrown in such as is part of the soldiers life <e> <s> but then in addition one has facing one an unattractive sample of ones own countrymen which must make the situation even more difficult <e> <s> another tribute i think we should pay is to the police for the great improvements that they have shown in staff duties training and equipment over the past few years <e> <s> we must bear in mind that the cost of policing today is immense <e> <s> in passing let me tell your lordships that i was told the other day that there are probably now a larger number of members of this house who are serving or who have recently served in the police force than ever before <e>", "<cs> my lords may i try to get clear one small point which may be clearer to others <e> <s> the authorised person is referred to in this amendment but i am not quite sure who is the authorised person <e> <s> presumably every constable would be an authorised person <e> <s> may he be also a constable of a force other than the british transport police <e> <s> again there are members of the staff of the railways who i believe have limited powers of arrest outside the powers of an ordinary citizen <e> <s> unless it is made really clear in this bill who are or are not the authorised people then we can have quite a lot of unnecessary ill-feeling and argument at the end <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend help me <e> <s> i did not get the reference <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask a short question particularly against the background that bicycle are much more numerous in certain countries in holland for example and in north-west germany than they are here <e> <s> may i be told whether pushing a bicycle not riding a bicycle in the ordinary way or pushing a tricycle are offences under this particular bill <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that we have revealed a principle in the very first few words of this very long bill <e> <s> it reveals the nature of the power which under the bill a constable is empowered to wield a power that can be in the hands of the youngest constable the very first hour of his service after he has been sworn in <e> <s> i give general support to this clause and without doubt i think that we should have some power such as we are now considering which is now made uniform throughout the whole of england <e> <s> the recent situation has been very unsatisfactory where a similar power has existed in london on merseyside and in certain other areas <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down could he give me a quick answer to my question about whether the term in the bill which we are discussing covers all the various police forces which we have in this country which together add up to quite a considerable number <e>", "<cs> i was astonished to hear some of the things which the noble lord lord gifford has just been saying <e> <s> i thought he was very nave and altogether too innocent at a time when most of us would believe there is much carrying of knives and other weapons on the streets of london <e> <s> i do not know how the noble lord would feel if he and his friends were out tonight in uniform and if he saw a knife blade or if he had had knife wounds before and was wondering what was going to happen the next time <e> <s> he might also be wondering whether his wife too was going to be widowed <e>", "<cs> i echo the point which the noble lord lord mishcon has just made though i did not go the whole way with him on one point <e> <s> he implied that we laymen in this chamber today who are interested in this subject were not outnumbered by the criminal lawyers and outweighed by their intellect <e> <s> perhaps some of us from time to time have tried to learn something of the practical side of policing from regular policemen <e> <s> the sad thing is that among us we have not more parliamentarians in both houses and in other parts of the country <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord a question before he sits down <e> <s> would he agree that after he has been arrested a man will spend something like hours while the paperwork is being completed following an arrest <e> <s> that demonstrates how impossible it is to stop <e> <s> search and detain men at football grounds under that sort of system <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may comment on what has been said by the noble lord lord elystan morgan <e> <s> i have not seen a search of the kind to which the noble lord has referred occur very frequently in public <e> <s> on the other hand if any of us suddenly found ourselves in charge of one or more men who had been arrested i believe we would be very anxious to see that they did not have any weapons in their pockets before there was any damage done to us <e> <s> that kind of thing can easily happen if a search is not sufficiently effectively carried through <e>", "<cs> if it is still in order to address amendment no <e> <s> i hope that i may do so very briefly and ask the minister whether he can tell us more about the shape form and length of these codes which will be laid before us soon i believe in draft <e> <s> it is possible that they may be very short <e> <s> they must be long enough or they are not going to serve their purpose <e> <s> on the other hand if they are made too long they will not be read and learned and understood in the same way <e> <s> in fact if they are too long they will be self-defeating and i think that that could easily happen <e> <s> i am not sure how many of these codes are already in view <e> <s> we have been discussing three of them under amendment no <e> <s> and i think that there are more to come <e>", "<cs> will my noble friend make one simple matter clear <e> <s> what does a police constable do with a man whom he is about to detain <e> <s> what is the difference between that and arresting him <e> <s> where does the police constable put him if he is responsible for a man who is detained <e>", "<cs> may i speak in support of the noble baroness particularly in respect of one point she made concerning the speed at which criminals move <e> <s> if we are to have road checks they must be set up instantly <e> <s> it is not a question of a pattern that one can set out on paper <e> <s> we must use men of experience who can move quickly and who can recognise offenders strange ways and suspicious characters <e> <s> we would not recognise them but practised police officers recognise strange ways and characters and can then check suspicious vehicles at the side of the road <e> <s> many criminals are caught in that way <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that efficient experienced police officers are going to be so impressed by these words in the bill whether or not slightly changed <e> <s> there is something called ways and means which is well-known in certain police circles <e> <s> if they thought there was some crime which they were by way of detecting they would be after it <e>", "<cs> i should like to respond to what the noble and learned lord opposite has just said <e> <s> i have tabled my amendment to replace the rank of superintendent with the lower rank of inspector on purpose <e> <s> however i am not quite sure that i have the words in the right place later in the bill <e> <s> it appears to be the wish of the noble and learned lord opposite to raise the level at which authority can be given to set up a major road check <e> <s> i believe that was the noble and learned lords point <e> <s> he mentioned brixton where blocks might be sited to cover a large area <e> <s> that <e>", "<cs> i have already said that i did not think my words were in the right place and i had that subsection in the back of my mind <e>", "<cs> am i not right in thinking that the powers contained in clause are all new powers <e> <s> there is no reason for getting pressure up about this <e> <s> the power to stop search and detain is a power which has existed for such undertakers for a very long time <e>", "<cs> i am glad that my noble friend accepts the principle <e> <s> i have not heard it debated in the chamber previously on other bills <e> <s> at this stage i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e> <s> however should i see any further opportunity on this bill or later i may raise the matter again <e>", "<cs> i think that what the noble lord has said meets my amendment <e> <s> clause says <e>", "<cs> it is written on the warrant and the police can ask for that person <e> <s> i thank the minister very much <e> <s> in view of the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> may i make one very brief comment on the first sentence of clause <e> <s> when the committee last met an amendment of mine was sandwiched between two amendments from the other side of the committee and there were cross-currents of conversation about a division and about dinner and my amendment was lost in the middle <e> <s> i should just like to make this point again and i can do so very properly on the first sentence of clause <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask just one question as regards the size of these committees <e> <s> there is reference to an area in the clauses but there is no reference to sub-committees or sub-areas <e> <s> it seems to me that a police area the area for which an authority is responsible could be a very large area <e> <s> if there is only one committee such as i see in the bill the distances will be so great that there will be very little personal contact between the committees and the people who are interested in the policing of their area <e> <s> could it be made clear that it is possible to have sub-committees as well as single committees <e>", "<cs> could my noble friend say how one chooses these representatives at least in a reasonable hurry because they are chosen from between and forces in the country <e> <s> there is no organisation and there was really great difficulty in getting special constables to work for the working parties a few years ago <e> <s> there is no national organisation <e>", "<cs> two thousand roughly <e>", "<cs> i was not very impressed by the reply of my noble friend <e> <s> i did not think that his reply amounted to very much help given that the special constabulary is giving such valuable help in the country <e> <s> he did not even agree to change the word may for shall in the first part of my amendment <e> <s> it is quite clear that it is very difficult for a back-bench member to draft a new clause like this which has to make reference to an act of parliament which is now a few years old <e> <s> i was hoping <e>", "<cs> that is a more enthusiastic reply and i can only say thank you for it <e> <s> but i do not think my noble friend is really correct in saying that all chief constables are enthusiastic about the special <e>", "<cs> i will have to return to this matter on another occasion <e> <s> i do not want to be rude but i thought that most of us knew that argument which we have heard in detail from the home office and which has been made to me before in correspondence and in conversation <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make just one short comment <e> <s> here we are at the beginning of the debate seeing one of the major difficulties with which we will have to contend through the next few days in terms of the detail and precision of the bill which we must ensure is correct not least where it defines police powers <e> <s> the whole essence of policing in western countries and probably most of all in this country of ours is that police officers junior as well as senior exercise their discretion every single day <e> <s> a great many of the powers that they exercise or purport to exercise are common-sense ones which we all applaud <e> <s> here we are at the moment between the two different positions and i am afraid that what we have to try to do is to come to a common-sense conclusion at the finale <e>", "<cs> my lords we have before us an amendment which erases the word designated <e> <s> this is good <e> <s> however if a constable employed by a statutory undertaker sees somebody who has committed a crime leaving say a marshalling yard he can if necessary pursue the man if he cannot catch the person who has committed the crime before he leaves the premises <e> <s> what will happen if a vehicle leaves by any exit designated or otherwise and is seen by a constable to be leaving the area <e> <s> can the constable pursue that vehicle or will it be lost <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be possible for some of us to think that discriminatory behaviour of that description is something that will be difficult to define <e> <s> what we want is good supervision in our police service at sergeant and more senior levels <e> <s> when men fall into wrong ways it is up to those who supervise them to see that their general behaviour is improved <e> <s> to say that the use of these or other words shall amount to an offence which will result in a mans being ejected straight from his force is wrong <e> <s> to make this discriminatory behaviour something which becomes an offence is surely impossible in practice because it relies entirely on the supervision both at the early and at the more senior stages <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down may i ask one question <e> <s> where do the special constables stand in all this <e> <s> my noble friend talks about an organisation with substantial resources and about police officers who pay regular contributions <e> <s> there was also reference to prison officers firemen and so on <e> <s> and i just wondered where special constables who are in the middle of all this stood <e>", "<cs> my lords may i give my support to the noble lord lord hooson <e> <s> i think that these few words which he is putting before us are very important <e> <s> if we read them together with the rest of the first subsection of clause it seems exactly what the general public wants <e> <s> i hope that the minister will agree <e> <s> there is always a little apprehension that he will tell us that chief officers of police are responsible for operations and that the maintenance of order in their areas is their responsibility <e> <s> i understand that the chief officer is responsible for maintaining order but i cannot see that it would be his responsibility to obtain the views of the community <e> <s> i strongly support the noble lord lord hooson <e>", "<cs> my lords i put down this amendment because it was unclear at committee stage what we should have in the way of an organisation and relationships between the special constabulary and their regular colleagues and others <e> <s> we may have gone a little further tonight but we have certainly not gone all the distance that we should have achieved <e> <s> i would not want at this time of night to expand the debate <e> <s> i would simply beg leave to withdraw the amendment at this stage but i can promise my noble friend that there will be something on some paper somewhere trying to put this right <e>", "<cs> my lord i would not wish to pursue the discussion at this time of the evening but i hope the minister can give some indication of the cost of this operation which could be considerable over the whole country <e> <s> also what will be the effect on establishments <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords what has been said today by the minister and myself indicates that this point has not been given enough time and thought <e> <s> i think i am right in saying something which the minister might have told us <e> <s> there are four schemes with four different forces in this country now being worked through so that the right sort of conclusions may be discovered <e> <s> it is a pity that we should be so definite at this stage when the home office has schemes in four different forces at the moment <e> <s> however i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to make a complicated issue even more complicated but i live very near to the border between england and scotland and i hope that this matter will be made so clear in the bill that all those concerned will understand <e> <s> furthermore i have had certain police connections concerned with arrests abroad and persons being brought back to this country under arrest <e> <s> what happens if they are on cross-channel boats and they are brought across the channel <e> <s> when does the clock start to tick <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister for some help so that i may be clear about what is a police station here <e> <s> if one is to calculate hours from the time when a person is in custody at a police station is the place where a police constable has his prisoner in his house or the office in the country a police station for this purpose <e> <s> is the definition clear regarding whether there is secure accommodation there or not <e> <s> is that defined <e>", "<cs> my lords now that we are nearly at the end of this marathon i would not wish to add more than a few sentences but i should like to make two points as briefly as i can <e> <s> the first is that we are imposing a very great burden on police constables under the provisions of the bill particularly the early parts of it <e> <s> it is clear that the police constable in the course of his duties will have to make a great number <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords but may i ask one short question before my noble friend the minister replies <e> <s> what scope is there under this order for a voluntary element or for a part-time element in the fire services <e> <s> such elements are very prominent and useful in some countries on the continent and could be very useful in northern ireland <e> <s> i am sorry to interrupt my noble friend in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few sentences in support of the government <e> <s> we ought not to read too much into some of the theoretical arguments which we have heard deployed in this house <e> <s> we have to remember that individual policemen will be out alone often late at night and through the small things they may see and think unreasonable they can be on the way to discovering quite considerable crime <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend be clearer than in her first reply <e> <s> she spoke about the police but we have already the chief executive of the county council who is apparently the chief in some counties <e> <s> then we have the senior soldier overlaying the chief executive and we may also have the chief constable too <e> <s> all three cannot be the leader <e> <s> who is to be the leader <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say what is the position in respect of the isle of man paper <e> <s> does it circulate south of the border like scottish notes <e> <s> or is it different <e>", "<cs> my lords may i raise one question for clarification which arises on clause <e> <s> we have created here a very long list of new offences and i wonder where this new prosecution service comes in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad that the noble lord lord harris has raised this important and difficult matter this afternoon <e> <s> he knows a great deal about it and the different sides of the subject <e> <s> in the course of the very few minutes that we have i shall speak about one side only the supply and traffic of drugs <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad that the noble lord raised this question this evening and i am also very glad that we shall shortly hear from the minister about the progress of this campaign described in the question and about what they propose to do to <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend make it clear to the industry whether this expenditure on research and development is aimed at an increase in production in this country or at a reduction <e> <s> that is where we have felt the pinch over the past year <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that very satisfactory answer <e> <s> i should like to ask him whether he can confirm that these are not just paper plans but that there are real things happening in this training <e> <s> further will he confirm that where there are no special confidential issues the police can be an integral part of the whole plan and not just have their own special plans <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether the supply of lsd in this country is largely or wholly imported and if so from which countries in the main <e> <s> can he say whether there is some processing or manufacture in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to interrupt the noble lord until he has finished <e>", "<cs> my lords my comments will be very few and i shall also put two or three questions which i spoke about when the noble lord lord glenarthur met me before <e> <s> but since he has given clear answers to the larger part of my questions i shall not do other than cut right back as far as i can because i do not want to be repetitive <e> <s> when i was looking at these regulations i came to the conclusion and i think that the noble lord lord mishcon would agree with it that they were not all that easy to understand for anyone certainly not the man in the street <e> <s> i would simply make this remark <e> <s> we have in this country at the present time a very wide interest in policing probably wider than we have had for a number of years and we have in one of the later clauses the provision for consultation <e> <s> therefore i hope that those responsible members of these committees will do their best to explain some of this to the general public which will widen their understanding and i think be of advantage to us all <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend apart from representations which are very important and have to be repeated is it not possible that a request be made to the south african government to give opportunities to people who may be in that country and know about police work and the use of force <e> <s> should they not have extended to them facilities which used to be available in south africa and which we do not want to lose <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend to confirm that the act to which he has referred is perfectly clear <e> <s> the minister at that time was the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter and i was his parliamentary secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i may be permitted to address the house for two minutes or even one minute <e> <s> this is not a speech but merely a matter of raising one point which follows on from what was said earlier by the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby concerning the very weak position that obtains when pursuing the matter of possible offences <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether the inspectors of the ministry of agriculture are in a position to give attention to the import of seeds and plants known as cannabis <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to be able to follow the noble lord lord mishcon who has close relations with the police <e> <s> he has had association with the police in the same sort of way that i have had that is close association with the police for a long time <e> <s> together we should be able to make a strong case <e>", "<cs> my lords might i ask my noble friend one question if he will allow me <e> <s> can he confirm that the government are doing their best to bring the police and the public really close together <e> <s> in the times in which we are living it is very important that that should happen and there is a terrible tendency that their ways should part <e>", "<cs> my lords can we all agree that we need not be so critical of the catering and hotel industry in this country but rather that the standards there have risen greatly over the past few years not only in the practical side of their work which is of a standard such as we see in hotels in switzerland and austria and which has been the case there for many years but that in addition we have very high standards in a number of colleges in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend for the second motion which we now have on the order paper and which i think is a great improvement on the first <e> <s> beyond that i should like to offer my support for much of what has been said from the benches opposite and i should like to have heard a little more from my colleagues on the benches on this side <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to give my support to this bill <e> <s> if ever there was a need for a revising chamber we have demonstrated it by our example this afternoon <e> <s> i should like to raise a matter upon which great urgency is laid <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord explain how far the clubs themselves pay for this policing <e> <s> is it because it is private property where the game takes place <e> <s> is that not right <e> <s> surely there is some sort of agreement <e>", "<cs> i ask my noble friend to consider the drafting again before report stage in one weeks <e>", "<cs> the amendment refers to loitering about in the vicinity of which is exactly what i said <e> <s> you may never get inside the ground you are loiterng in the vicinity <e>", "<cs> the hour is late <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i did not hear exactly what the noble lord said <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful for what my noble friend has said <e> <s> i see his point but i do not think his argument deserves quite the weight that he has given it <e> <s> it is suggested that something will happen very rapidly <e> <s> when you are on a football ground you will have policemen in small groups led almost certainly by a sergeant <e> <s> when i put down the words of this amendment i thought to myself that a sergeant would be an extremely good compromise between the rank of inspector and what is in the bill <e> <s> if my noble friend will tell me that he will have a look at this before report stage i shall beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has given us just about the worst case to describe the circumstances that i have tried to describe <e> <s> i have seen something of the sort happen <e> <s> i should think that the wise experienced <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful <e> <s> i thought it was right <e> <s> i do not want to waste any more time <e> <s> i want to put this point across <e> <s> i do not want to make the same points that we considered last week <e>", "<cs> my lords the argument has arrived at exactly the same point as we left it last week <e> <s> i should not like to take up time by pressing the matter any further today <e> <s> however i should like to make the point that this is not the only country in the world where men are endowed with police powers on the very day that they are sworn in and become members of a service <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him a question <e> <s> how does he intend that payment should be made for special constables when they are on duty at matches wearing virtually the same uniform as regulars <e> <s> the amendment suggests the words a police presence <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope i can keep my few remarks within one minute <e> <s> even if critical of this rush job nevertheless i pay tribute because i am sure that a great deal of good will flow from our deliberations <e> <s> we were discussing much the same points six years ago in this chamber and although that seems to have been a long time ago no doubt water dripping on stone is one of the ways in which government works <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that last july this house was given far too little time to get through the proper duties of a revising chamber <e> <s> there were all the pressures to complete the different stages of that bill by august <e> <s> it is likely that we are <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend let us know only in the rough how these figures are calculated <e> <s> does every fisherman have to report his catch every day or does somebody have a good guess <e> <s> otherwise these figures that have been quoted from different parts of the house do not sound very convincing <e>", "<cs> my lords when my noble friend spoke about all factors all considerations he referred to america as other noble lords have done <e> <s> can my noble friend not tell us something about our nearest close neighbour france where the situation is much more easily comparable with our own than anything in america <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very satisfactory first reply to this question <e> <s> however considering the controversy which there is bound to be and the fact that there cannot be very many of us who have had experience of these water cannon would it not be good if a party were organised of members of this house who were interested to go to hendon or wherever it may be to learn how effective they are <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell us what particular industries are responsible for these emissions <e> <s> up to a short time ago and not least in germany which is so sensitive about its forests there was no damage in the forest and no reference to damage at all now it is repeated the whole time <e> <s> apparently damage comes from particular industries <e> <s> can the noble lord tell us which ones <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to refer to the noble lord lord wigoder who was i believe the first to mention the immense volume of work that we were imposing on the shoulders of individual police officers in accepting this document <e> <s> i am not forgetting that there will be other documents of different sorts under the act that must be learnt by individual police officers <e> <s> there is more i am sure to come <e> <s> this booklet contains or so pages that will have to be learnt <e> <s> i believe that there are bound to be more than a few traps when in the light of practice we discover how different parts of the procedures are working <e> <s> i hope that we shall be able to remain in touch with the noble lord the minister <e> <s> i am sure that we shall want a debate in say a year from now at which time i should like to hear how matters are working out <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness tell me whether any fraction of this sum of money has gone towards supporting the ship which calls frequently at the island <e> <s> can the noble baroness say generally that communications must be very important to us both surface and air <e> <s> would she also bear in mind that there may not be a large number of people on this island but they are very loyal and i should like to think that they are given a fair share of what is available <e> <s> it is not the same as giving to many of those to whom we heavily subscribe and who have little feeling for us at all <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late stage of this debate i shall try to be very short two minutes or less if necessary <e> <s> my main point is that a great deal has happened during the three or four years since we had our previous debate in this house <e> <s> i think great credit is due here to the british public for understanding and accepting the new rules <e> <s> they have done a lot enforcing their own discipline <e> <s> there could have been friction between heavy vehicles private transport and police <e> <s> there could have been considerable bandying of words but there has been very little <e> <s> if a police constable is on his feet and the cab of a heavy vehicle is right above him it is impossible for him to see and check whether there is a seat belt in use or not <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all very grateful to the noble lord lord harris of greenwich for raising this theme this afternoon and for giving the house so much information which it is important to have and which we must consider <e> <s> the noble lord and i have worked at different times on different themes associated with the police <e> <s> this afternoon i do not want to go over the same ground but i shall try as far as i can to refer to other sides of what is such a vital question <e>", "<cs> my lords may i be permitted to ask the minister a simple question which is this is there intended to be collaboration with foreign countries not just through the metropolitan police but through other forces in this country or is it to be done through london <e>", "<cs> my lords may i take two minutes or less if that is allowed <e> <s> as president of the tourist board in cumbria i find it sad to see how far the railways have been run down with over-enthusiasm shown by those at the head of the railways <e> <s> they forget some of the interests upon which we place a higher priority <e> <s> there has been mention of the eden valley line <e> <s> no encouragement of any kind was extended to that line <e> <s> however when the traffic had left it they announced that too few people were travelling on it and that it was not viable <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl note the point i made of no through trains being shown in the abc <e> <s> therefore they are not marketing much <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness whether she is sure that there are no obstructions in the way of training which i believe at one time held up the number of skilled chiropodists <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend to ensure that the beaches at west cumberland are made as clear of pollution as is possible because of the very special risks there from pollution from sellafield and surrounding works <e> <s> there is considerable anxiety in that neighbourhood and i should like to feel that people are free from anxiety as well as from the actual pollution <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the increase in paperwork which has resulted from the extra work following the police and criminal evidence act which we passed last year may i ask this question <e> <s> can my noble friend give us some idea as to how far the extra work is to be absorbed by the police stations all over the country <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend give us an idea of the cost of an efficient police service <e> <s> we have had a number of increases over recent years no doubt there will be more to come <e> <s> i think it is right that we should know what sort of figure is involved <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that a great deal of trouble is taken in the lake district and not just in scotland which has already been referred to and that the three colleges in that district run training competitions of different types with great advantage to the industry <e> <s> great steps are being made <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is a little late to make ordinary speeches at this stage at least from my point of view <e> <s> i think that more properly i can make just one relevant point <e> <s> i am sure that the noble earl will allow me to say that if i were to reply to his speech it would take quite a time and the hour is late <e> <s> he probably will not think it discourteous of me if i do not deal with his speech now <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the weeks training course to which he has just referred is shorter than the training course for police in all major west european countries <e> <s> indeed in germany the training course is two-and-a-half years and not weeks <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend inform the house what sort of interval exists when men apply to our provincial police forces <e> <s> it would be helpful to know whether or not the figures given for the metropolitan police are typical for england <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make one simple comment <e> <s> it concerns the word practical which the noble earl mentioned in his last few sentences <e> <s> i have always felt from contacts with police in this country and elsewhere that it is extremely difficult for any man to get these subtleties exactly right on the spur of the moment <e> <s> the matter can be so clear for the most able criminal lawyers in the country <e> <s> but it is the common sense knowledge and dignity of the police constable or sergeant on which these questions depend <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask a question in a grey area <e> <s> every police officer no matter how junior has the same oath and powers as a senior police officer <e> <s> he must act accordingly <e> <s> at the same time a young man may at a given moment not realise that instructions are coming from above and that a senior officer has in fact given instructions as to what he should do <e> <s> the junior officer having seen the situation with his own eyes and acted within his powers may then find that there is a clash <e> <s> this may often happen <e> <s> is it accepted generally that one decision overrules the other or not <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords so far the noble earl has gone a short distance but he has not shown any great interest in the international side which i mentioned in my question or in the co-operation or particularly in connection with the control of dangerous drugs <e>", "<cs> my lords may i refer to my noble friends point about co-operation <e> <s> are there now detailed plans between the french and british police <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the bill <e> <s> i feel that it has come before us at a very timely moment <e> <s> the times through which we have lived over the last two years show the need for many of the non-home office police forces to be re-organised <e> <s> we have had the authority for individual constables to be brought into these forces but i am not sure where we have the authority to bring the force up to date <e> <s> we now have in this bill the position made very much clearer than before <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps my noble friend would allow me to ask one question <e> <s> can the minister make it clear whether or not the oath taken by all constables is now uniform throughout the whole country or must we go back to limited jurisdiction in many forces <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for giving me that answer which has met my point <e> <s> at the same time i should like to say and i hope that he agrees with me that over the last few years relations between the professional and the volunteer have improved out of all recognition <e> <s> i therefore hope that the noble lord opposite will agree with me and do his best as i hope to to help to bring them closer together <e> <s> i ask leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to add the very briefest word to this discussion <e> <s> the jurisdiction as defined in clause should make the position clear not just for the experts to understand but for the ordinary man in the street and every police constable irrespective of whether he is a member of the home office force or the ministry of defence police because there is a difference between jurisdiction which affects property and jurisdiction which affects persons <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will say a word about that now <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend think that these are suitable places to practise foreign languages <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a difference between the hmi report and the views of the -plus chief constables <e> <s> is it possible for this matter to be more open than it is at present with a distinction being made between an operational and a non-operational matter which a chief constable could report <e> <s> beyond that can it be made clear that there is no statutory existence for what we now call the acpo and that there is no statutory need for that group to make any report such as may exist for chief constables <e> <s> they do not make any report and in any case to whom might they make such a report <e> <s> perhaps it is time this matter was cleared up <e>", "<cs> my lords i am speaking in a more guarded way than some noble lords who will be taking part in this debate maybe because i have taken part in so many forestry committees throughout the whole of my adult life <e> <s> in particular i remember in committees the forestry commission the cla and the timber growers organisation when we faced the brave future we knew that there would be problems yet i do not think we realised how difficult it would be to work out a forestry policy as indeed has proved to be the case <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask exactly what the point is <e> <s> i think that what is suggested also happens when half of london is flooded <e> <s> is it so unreasonable that there should be claims under the same heading <e>", "<cs> let me come back to enforcement for just one minute <e> <s> in enforcement as one heard explained there were some clear tests which could prove difficult and there were others that were not always easy <e> <s> furthermore a police constable who comes up against a situation of this sort will have to make his decision very quickly <e> <s> i have made this point during the last few years <e> <s> from time to time we have omitted to consider the difficulties of the average police constable who may be very young in coming very quickly to a decision which will be accepted <e> <s> if he does not do it properly he will become extremely unpopular <e>", "<cs> my lords has my noble friend any information relevant to these campaigns in neighbouring countries so that it can be compared with what has happened here <e>", "<cs> my lords i continue to be surprised that in the euphoria surrounding the developments in eastern europe since november last year sufficient recognition has sometimes not been given to the fact that it is we who have won the cold war <e> <s> for my entire life europe has been divided by an iron curtain across which ideologies confronted each other supported with arms <e> <s> on our side in the west our citizens supported the military while on the other side those armed forces doubled up to suppress the citizens of eastern europe <e>"]
