despite his important duties he will find time to come here occasionally or preferably often in order to enlighten us particularly when he can bring to bear an expertness as he did today on the question of the setting up of the european economic and social policy research institute <e> <s> on that subject i wholly agree with the noble baroness lady seear who opened the debate and with what i recall i read of the evidence of the noble lord lord vaizey that it would be most improper if there were recruited a number of people who were paid salaries which are not obtainable in net terms anywhere in the world and who were put there for life <e> <s> i should much prefer a small staff of people appointed for periods of perhaps five or seven years and i should certainly wish to get away from the communitys practice of appointing people in such a way that it is necessary to find say an italian socialist who is an expert in monetary policy so as to be able to fill a particular niche

noble viscount lord rochdale and my own name ardwick <e> <s> it is a formidable hard sounding northern thing <e> <s> then of course there are the two scottish peers who have taken part and the noble baroness who comes i think from london but who came to the debate today clothed in the garments of righteousness and made a most notable and interesting speech <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an aspect of airport life which i think arthur hailey failed to include in his famous novel <e> <s> i think that if he had heard what we have heard this afternoon he might have done so <e> <s> during the past four years i have been every week and sometimes twice a week across the channel starting at heathrow <e> <s> when coming back to london i have often had to wait almost as long for my baggage <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble viscount to think again about what he has just said <e> <s> i had the same qualms <e> <s> however i looked into the situation because there are many people in the labour movement and in the educational world who fail to understand why we on this side of the house did not vote against the bill on second reading <e> <s> as those of your lordships who heard the speeches made on that occasion will appreciate we took that course not because we did not feel strongly opposed to the bill but as my noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may make an uncovenanted intervention in the european assembly pay bill <e> <s> when it was originally proposed to pay members of the european parliament the same salary the same miserable salary that members of

that for the european mps there are going to be generous allowances <e> <s> i think that none of them is going to suffer the pangs of poverty over the next five years <e> <s> indeed there are some ways in which they are going to be better off than members of parliament here because they are guaranteed five uninterrupted years <e> <s> that is we are guaranteeing them something between and and perhaps more than that so if there were a delay of a few weeks in receiving their salaries i think they would be able to take that without any hardship or hard feelings <e>", "<cs> my lords on the subject of getting the work of this house better known to the wider world i wonder whether the noble lord the leader of the house has read the <e>", "<cs> my lords since i have recently become the chairman of the press freedom committee of the commonwealth press union perhaps i had better explain straight away that what i am saying today is entirely a personal view <e> <s> it is years since i and fellow members of the national union of journalists demonstrated in the streets against the official secrets act <e> <s> what we had against mr neville chamberlains government at that particular moment on official secrets i cannot well remember but i do remember that we were extremely upset about the situation and ever since then the act has been under intermittent attack from journalists from trade unionists and from lawyers with a deep concern for civil liberties <e> <s> in recent years the criticism has grown and grown as government have come to have a greater impact upon our daily lives often a beneficial impact although sometimes a restrictive one so that people have felt an increasing need to find out what the government are really doing what they are thinking and how their agents are acting when they are out of the public view <e> <s> so the arrogant secretiveness of the old establishment is no longer tolerable and perhaps rather reluctantly governments have come to accept this <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say with what great pleasure i follow the noble lord lord evans of hungershall <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to associate myself with the words of sympathy to the noble lord lord ballantrae <e> <s> i like many others have always regarded him as one of the most endearing and gallant men in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all i should like to congratulate my noble friend lord strauss on his maiden speech <e> <s> i have just been recalling to him that over years ago he heard me make my maiden political speech in what in those days

<s> i am very glad to follow the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale because i agree very much with what he said at the beginning of his remarks and certainly what he said about the written word <e> <s> about other matters his legal experience and knowledge took me beyond my personal experience <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am sorry that this debate is taking place on a thursday night when it is not very usual for us to have a full house here <e> <s> should have liked to see a bigger attendance <e> <s> although we have got three of the old guard from brussels here it would have been nice if some of the new members of the european parliament who are also members of this house had been able to come to this debate tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords the ministers reply in another place was not merely disappointing to those who had worked on this project for some years and thought they were on the verge of success <e> <s> it was also deeply unsatisfactory <e> <s> but now i think that the government themselves are learning that it is not good enough whenever an expenditure is to he cut or a proposed expenditure is to be turned down for a minister to shelter behind a few well-chosen words about the need for financial stringency <e> <s> we all know that there is such a need <e> <s> we all accept that the need for stringency is real <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that not all of us on this side of the house stand for the kind of censorship which has been suggested <e> <s> on the other hand those of us who are veterans of the media deplore a modern tendency towards what is called faction that is towards the treatment of fact as if it were fictional <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble baroness not for the first time i rise in this chamber intimidated by what has gone before <e> <s> in my case it was not the noble lord lord kearton who was responsible for it but my noble friend lord rhodes and the noble lord lord thorneycroft <e> <s> i thought that they spoke with the voices of prophetic authority but at times when they thundered across the chamber at one another i felt that i <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble and learned lord find some sympathy in his heart for trade unionists who feel that they are facing an elective dictatorship <e>", "<cs> first i would like to say a word of gratitude to the noble lord lord ohagan for arranging this debate today <e> <s> i should also like to say a word about the report itself <e> <s> perhaps i ought not to do that since i am a member of the committee which produced the report and indeed of the sub-committee which was responsible for it <e> <s> nevertheless as an old editor i cannot resist giving my private pulitzer prize to whoever it was who put the words on paper because they have dealt with a most difficult subject in a beautifully clear and concise manner <e> <s> i am afraid that when you leave the rhetoric behind and get into the detail many of the subjects with which the european community deals are rather heavy going none of them more so than the community budget <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may interrupt the noble lord for a moment <e> <s> may i ask him to speak a little closer to the microphone <e> <s> what he is saying is most interesting he has beautiful diction and a very good voice but we are losing about one word in ten <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the first time that i have spoken on an economic subject in the life of this parliament although there have been as the noble lord lord alport reminded us such debates <e> <s> before that i spoke frequently on such gloomy subjects hoping that if i had nothing that was strikingly original to say at least i might make the prevailing labour orthodoxy more vivid with the help of a few phrases which at an earlier time in my life i would have used to illuminate a newspaper column or lighten a newspaper leader <e>", "<cs> as a journalist i am as concerned to defend the freedom of broadcasting as i am the freedom of the press <e> <s> nevertheless i sympathise a great deal with my noble friends on the front bench <e> <s> surely there is no problem when the commission is dealing with an inadvertent error there should be no problem when it is merely a controversial view of recent historical facts <e> <s> a real problem arises when you have malice malicious invention and malicious distortion when you have novels purporting to be biographies and which present a malicious view of the anti-hero where you have fiction posing as documentaries <e> <s> these are the new problems and they are problems which affect the novel <e> <s> but they also very much affect television <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that i was not present at the beginning of the debate <e> <s> i give general support to the idea of stricter and wider standards in training <e> <s> i started off with the idea that clause was in itself adequate <e> <s> i had a slight doubt about the amendments <e> <s> i thought that they tried to spell out in too much detail what should be done <e> <s> that surely should be left to the authority <e> <s> i should like to see the clause amended to take into account the phrases in the amendment of the noble baroness lady seear about sex and ethnic origin and about special stress being given to women and those from ethnic minorities having equal opportunities <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with all the noble sentiments expressed on this side of the house and i also agree with the noble lord lord home of the hirsel when he says that this amendment is superfluous <e> <s> it is a harmless indeed excellent amendment but it is really unnecessary <e> <s> the idea that in this day and age a new channel the channel with the objectives of the fourth channel should neglect international affairs is really quite absurd <e> <s> i feel that some noble lords who have taken part in the debate this afternoon have spoken as if in ignorance of what is being done today on radio and television about what is going on abroad <e> <s> there are some absolutely splendid programmes just as there are some splendid articles in our national press <e> <s> i cannot agree with the view that our national press the serious press gives less attention or devotes less skill to foreign affairs than does the press of other countries <e> <s> there is <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that this clause is merely an endorsement of the time-honoured right of journalists to negotiate with their editors the quantity of contributed matter that shall appear in their newspapers and that most editors would be quite happy about it <e> <s> does he not think that on subjects of such complexity it would be far better for them to be considered in a full-ranging debate rather than in this manner at question time <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise for not being here at the beginning of the debate but i had a medical appointment which could not be broken <e> <s> i must also plead an interest i have been a member of the national union of journalists for years and i am a life member now <e> <s> i think the suspicions which are couched in section e the closed shop and the freedom of the press may apply to the national union of journalists rather than to the institute of journalists which is full of sweetness and light but is not very effectual as a trade union although it is a legitimate trade union <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand it but it is beyond the power of the british government to give any such guarantee <e>", "<cs> my lords the last two speeches have reminded me of one occasion when within hours thanks to an aeroplane i was able to be blessed by the chief rabbi in jerusalem and then by the pope in rome among the multitude of course <e> <s> the blessings had singularly little effect since i collapsed and almost died the next day <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wigoder was good enough to refer to my temerity as the only layman to intervene in this debate <e> <s> i remember what happened some years ago in another place when a member found himself in the same situation as i am today <e> <s> he was noted for his intellectual arrogance and he said that although not a lawyer he thought he could make a valuable contribution to the debate <e> <s> pritt kc <e> <s> following him referred to him rather disparingly as the almost learned gentleman <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that i am sure the media will be most appreciative of the course the noble and learned lord has now taken <e>", "<cs> i have been warned by my doctor not to waste my convalescent energy in debate but i must say how strongly i associate myself with the words of my noble friend lady jeger and how much i dissent from my noble friend lord mishcon on the front bench and how much i agree with what was said by the noble and learned lord lord scarman and with what was said too from the liberal benches <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that all editors will be grateful for the improvements made to the bill and hopeful that further improvements will be made when the bill goes elsewhere <e> <s> i think that they will also be very grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor and to the legal luminaries who have done so much work on this bill and who have been very conscious of the need to balance the freedom to publish with the right of the citizen to a fair trial <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that those of us who still have faith in the european idea are a little upset perhaps at the slightness of the economic side of the statement that he has made this afternoon <e> <s> we all agree that there must be a fight against inflation <e> <s> we can all see that there could be dangers in short-term stimulus but there used to be in the community even two years ago an idea of a concerted effort to deal with recession <e> <s> there was the idea of a concerted plan of growth <e> <s> have those ideas been posponed or have they been abandoned <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that some of us on this side would be embarrassed if the pathetic modesty of our means was declared to the public and to our potential creditors <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that not even the doughtiest defender of the freedom of the press could make any excuse for some of the conduct of certain newspapers and television coverage recently <e> <s> nevertheless the noble lords answer will give a good deal of satisfaction to those who have thought seriously about the problem <e> <s> one must remember the difficulty which the noble lord lord wigoder had in his private bill when he attempted to legislate over a very small section of this problem <e> <s> it is best to leave it to the press council to examine what has happened and then try to come up with a better principle than the one they have which again to quote lord wigoder gave newspapers and the media a certain outlet and excuse of behaving in the public interest in these affairs <e>", "<cs> my lords first i must thank the noble lord lord ohagan for giving us the opportunity to debate europe in a positive fashion <e> <s> i should like at some time for us to have a debate on the future of europe in which we are not specifically concerned with britain but with the future of europe and the future development of the community as a whole <e> <s> i must also pay tribute to the two maiden speeches from the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs and the noble lord lord john-mackie which i thought were unusually thoughtful as well as charming particularly lord john-mackies use of the windows here as a visual aid <e> <s> i am very glad to see that the brothers mackie although divided by party are undivided on the question of the cap <e> <s> it was from lord mackie of benshie that i first learned that there was a great deal to be said for the common agricultural policy that the prices paid to farmers were just rather than generous and that the surpluses although excessive were not very much more excessive than prudent husbandry would require <e> <s> i hope that is a correct interpretation <e>", "<cs> my lords in his opening statement the noble lord seemed to suggest that on economic policy the differences are not as wide as the newspapers have suggested <e> <s> i should like to ask him to tell us a little more about president mitterrands ideas <e> <s> was not it a very familiar conventional and modest idea that m mitterrand put forward for a selected co-ordinated european expansion

again about this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer which is not quite as negative as some people might suppose nevertheless it is a disappointing answer <e> <s> do not the government realise that this is a false economy <e> <s> do not they see that by jeopardising reducing this service they are risking the loss or the diminution of a minor but quite precious asset that this service manages to persuade stations in one hundred countries throughout the world to pay a small subscription to broadcast the very best in british radio and this gives us a presence and it gives us an influence which is the envy of other governments who will immediately leap in and supplant it with free services if we go out or substantially reduce the services as the government now intend <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not the mickey mice nor the charlie

that what the noble earl said will be dealt with adequately by my noble friend lord paget of northampton who is to speak next but one <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow the noble lord lord morris when he calls attention to the gap between the governments professed admiration for the external services and their financial provisions <e> <s> it is rather like a man who tells his wife how

governments attitude in these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords not only have i heard of the british council but i have spoken in your lordships house of the struggles of the british council because of the meanness and parsimony of the british government to continue on course and of the terrible effect that has had on the morale of the employees of the british council just as it is having on the morale of the external services <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but could he particularise between the tapes service and the general transcription service <e> <s> as i understand it about seven of the members of the tapes service are having to be unloaded and their output is being reduced by almost per cent <e>", "<cs> it does not my lords if the noble lord will forgive me <e>

is being fully maintained <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in agreement with the arguments of my noble friend lord lever of manchester but noble lords on the benches opposite must not assume from that that

sympathy with some of the things which the noble lord lord robertson of oakridge has just said although i am not a sabbatarian <e> <s> however before i get on to that i should first like to say a word of congratulation to the noble viscount lord mackintosh for his maiden speech which i thought was very well phrased very lucid very clear and frank and although i disagreed with it i disagreed with

regard to an international solution of the problems that confront us <e> <s> but first i should like to congratulate my noble friend lord gormley on a most remarkable and refreshing maiden speech <e> <s> may i express the hope that his other duties will permit him to come here regularly and to speak frequently <e>", "<cs> my lord i was going to say that it was not the mould which was sterile it was the situation or the climate or the environment in which the mould existed <e> <s> as the noble lord said it was the inflation generated by the vietnamese war and later on by the fantastic increase in arab oil prices that brought about the sterility <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him to extend his speech a little further <e> <s> how does he reconcile his statement if i heard it correctly that he regards the future of industry not only in this country but also in western europe as a subsidised appendage of a service society with his desire for the continuance of world free trade <e>", "<cs> my lords first i must thank the noble lord lord orr-ewing for introducing this debate and for doing so in terms of such moderation and persuasion <e> <s> then i must congratulate the three maiden speakers who were extremely interesting in the content of what they had to say but were also very clear and extremely brief <e> <s> all these are virtues but may i whisper to them that when they address us again which we hope they will and often they could be just a bit longer not very much just a bit longer and we should hear them with pleasure <e>", "<cs> my lords it is just over a month since we had our last debate on economic affairs <e> <s> we were debating the address and the autumn statement and this did not give us nearly enough scope to discuss the british problem in the context of the world economic problem <e> <s> we could only touch on the wider issues but touch on them several of us did and got away from the assumption on which too many economic debates are based that we live not just on a geographical island but also on an economic island master of our financial fate captain of our commercial soul <e> <s> on that occasion i said that we needed a broader debate and today we must thank the noble lord lord lever of manchester for giving us such an opportunity <e> <s> but i wish he had been able to lay his hands as he himself does on a better instrument of discussion than an unstarred question coming on late in an evening just nine wassailing nights before christmas and when outside there seems to be the last act of king lear being enacted judging by the thunderous noises we have heard <e>", "<cs> my lords i was merely referring to the noise upstairs the noise of the thunder outside <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of leakages is running rather hard politically <e> <s> may i confirm what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i was with some of my old colleagues leader writers in fleet street at lunchtime <e>

earlier than i had hoped <e> <s> the reason for both my latecoming and my early departure is a domestic <e> <s> problem the nature of which i have explained privately to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord recall that the press council has warned the newspapers that unless they look after themselves and discipline themselves it may perhaps be impossible for the press council to defend them against legislation <e> <s> is he further aware that the national union of journalists has gone so far as to contemplate asking for legislation on this subject and does he know that today two distinguished ex-editors the noble lord lord jacobson and mr charles wintour have both suggested independently on different radio programmes that two or three newpaper proprietors could bring this matter to an end <e> <s> could he suggest to somebody in high authority in the government that there should be a quiet talk with those proprietors <e>", "<cs> my lords i must congratulate my noble friend lord hale on his ingenuity in finding a way to bring before this house a problem which looked threatening when it emerged a few weeks ago but has since happily disappeared the proposed employment of public funds to preach a message on a subject which has ceased to be bipartisan and is now at the centre of political controversy <e> <s> i mean of course the nuclear weapons question <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder if the noble lord is certain of what was the convention on these things <e> <s> i remember that on one occasion i wrote a very simplified version of a white paper on mr richard crossmans pensions schemes <e> <s> the conservative opposition were consulted on that and indeed had to agree before even a popular version of a white paper could be produced <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord could give a picture of a board as he visualises it <e> <s> it would have one or two agriculturists perhaps one or two executives from the water industry and a couple of people from local government <e> <s> it would help me at a later stage of the discussion if we could have some kind of an idea of the rest the other five or six members <e>", "<cs> i think my professional interest in the subject is well known to this committee <e> <s> i must say that i find it remarkable and deplorable that in a government which should be opening up new sources of information and new opportunities of participation are actually shutting one down <e> <s> the people who are most upset by this are the editors of the sturdy regional and local newspapers which play a great part in informing the public of the work of local authorities and of boards of this kind <e> <s> the government are closing down a source of information and an opportunity for the public to influence authority which the public have enjoyed through the medium of the press during the past years <e> <s> yet there is no change in the functions of the boards <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister a question <e> <s> did i understand him aright in saying that the government had not thought of this infamous proposal for themselves but that it was put into their heads by the monopolies and mergers commission <e> <s> is that what the noble lord said <e>", "<cs> my lords i must thank the noble lord lord ferrier for giving us an opportunity to debate this subject but i do not go along with him entirely <e> <s> i do not believe that we should cavil too much about yesterday in parliament <e> <s> the bbc as we have discovered is under no obligation to give this second report of our proceedings <e> <s> they do so because they think it will interest a sufficient number of listeners <e> <s> we who believe it is important for the nation to know what is going on in parliament should regard this as a bonus all the more so because the bbc is not merely performing a pious democratic exercise but is trying to make parliament of interest to a wider audience of listeners <e>", "<cs> this amendment fits very well into the following series of amendments under the name of the noble lord lord sandford in that it endeavours to strengthen the purposes and the functions of the consumer councils and anybody who heard the noble baroness lady burton speaking in the last debate will i think feel that these are very necessary measures <e> <s> at an earlier stage of the debates on this bill all the sponsors of this amendment were sponsors of another one which provided for the admission of the press to meetings of the water authorities <e> <s> that was rejected after the minister had contended that the new boards were of a different nature of a more executive nature from the former boards although making exactly the same kinds of decisions <e> <s> i myself still think that the press should be there but one cannot reopen that issue <e> <s> what one can say is that the press would have been in attendance not because they enjoyed a privilege they would have enjoyed merely a facility which enabled them to be the eyes and ears of the public and especially those members of the public who pay a very substantial water rate <e> <s> in other words the right of press access was the right of public access <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us whether the government have any idea about the time-span involved <e> <s> how long is likely to elapse before cable becomes a substantial competitor of the bbc and itv <e>", "<cs> my lords i must thank the noble lord lord hunter for introducing this subject for debate <e> <s> i myself had the idea of doing the same thing but i did not quite see the way to do it i was not bold enough <e> <s> but as there has been some suggestion that it is an innovation that we should debate a book of essays i may say that i have a dim recollection that many years before i came to this house a book of essays was debated under the leadership of the noble lord lord walston who organised a team each of whom took one chapter of the book <e> <s> thus he got a highly structured debate <e> <s> i am sorry that we did not have time in this short debate for any such device to be adopted <e>", "<cs> my lords i regarded that as a piece of verbal fun and not a serious charge <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> i do so with a good deal of trepidation although it is a modest bill a very sensible <e>", "<cs> my lords just as the noble lord lord houghton regretted that he could not give me warmer support for the bill i regret that i cannot give a more enthusiastic backing to it on behalf of my honourable friend the member for goole <e> <s> i should like to acquit him of any charge of wanting to insult the house <e> <s> he simply got it wrong <e> <s> he must have been thinking of the differential proportion of members for the council of europe <e> <s> that difference is totally unacceptable on a joint committee <e>", "<cs> my lords may i for the first time and for the last time today say a kind word about the result that the prime minister has achieved <e> <s> but is it really a result <e> <s> is it not dependent in the end upon french agreement <e> <s> and is that agreement not dependent upon a general settlement being reached about the new rates of contributions <e>", "<cs> my lords the prime minister has won a famous victory in terms of seats if not in terms of votes but even though she has secured the positive backing of less than one-third of the electorate she has an impregnable majority and can look forward to four or five years in power to complete the task she began in <e> <s> what one hopes is that the government will avoid exercising what the noble and learned lord who sits on the woolsack once defined as an elective dictatorship <e> <s> of course this philosophic insight was not vouchsafed to him during the lifetime of the previous tory government but that of the last labour government which like all recent governments rested on a minority of voters <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord harris of greenwich for giving the house an opportunity to debate this important report of the press council on the conduct of the press in respect of the sutcliffe case <e> <s> i hope the press will take note that the people taking part in this debate are not aristocratic backwoodsmen with a feeble regard for the freedom of the press <e> <s> the noble lord lord harrris of greenwich served his time as a journalist and retuned to the old black art between political engagements <e> <s> the noble lord lord mcgregor of durris was chairman of the last royal commission on the press and under his leadership it produced a sensible shrewd and liberal report <e> <s> my noble friend lord jacobson and i have spent a lifetime in newspapers some of it at the rough end of the trade <e> <s> we know well the difficulty of reconciling high ethical standards with a need to stay in business when faced with less scrupulous

but i can congratulate him on getting exactly the wavelength of this chamber <e> <s> it is something which not everybody is capable of doing <e> <s> i also ask him to note that we gave him a solid mancunian second row going back to lord rhodes and including himself with lord diamond beyond and also my noble friend lord lever of manchester <e>", "<cs> my lords although the last supple mentary question has largely taken my point may i say that what alarms the people of europe is not merely the build-up of nuclear arms but the build-up of nuclear arms in a deteriorating political situation and it is only the pursuit of some form of detente which will give them any hope during the consequent build-up of arms <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that although there may be anxiety on this side about this new practice there is anxiety about another thing <e> <s> i do not think that there is in the length and breadth of <e>", "<cs> my lords one can see that fashionable spectacles

first is the position of the provinces <e> <s> i do not want to take a single penny away from london <e> <s> it is the centres of excellence in london which provide so much inspiration for their fellow artists in the provinces <e> <s> i am thinking principally of the city where i was brought up manchester <e> <s> in my youth it was a city rich in culture and it was a culture created and maintained by an affluent and cosmopolitan middle-class <e>", "<cs> yes it is listed my lords <e> <s> if the noble earl is assuring me that all the money which will be lost with the disappearance of the metropolitan council will be funded from a central source i shall be relieved and i think a number of manchester people will too <e>", "<cs> if that is the case then i am very glad because any kind of idea that great national and international companies are going to sponsor provincial enterprises and give them the security that they have is just not on <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i missed the maiden speech of the noble lord lord peyton of yeovil <e> <s> as a journalist i have heard him on many occasions and he has often given me anguished delight delight at his style of utterance and anguish at the arguments that he has advanced <e> <s> thank god that today we are not debating a party subject and i am able to agree with almost every word that the noble lord <e> <s> lord orr-ewing has spoken <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that against the video nasties we would be one of the video niceties <e> <s> if there is a permanent record of what goes on in this chamber i think that it should be quite possible for someone to make a kind of feature film out of various debates in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord hanson on a most interesting and informative speech <e> <s> he has convinced me of what i was already beginning to suspect that cabling is not a new technology it is an intermediate technology that

is what it would lead to <e> <s> i do not think that that would be very popular in this country <e> <s> you would have more people switching to the bbc perhaps <e>", "<cs> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> that reassurance is very welcome but we were not thinking of the scot or the welshman on the authority exerting a continuous repressive influence on the operator <e> <s> we were thinking of the representative being there in the beginning when the choice is made and when a decision has to be made about the range and diversity of the programmes and whether they should include something of the national culture of the country in which the cable operator is working <e> <s> that is what is in our minds <e>", "<cs> i am just wondering what will happen if an area is half cabled and if programmes go out to half the area <e> <s> does the licence begin then <e>", "<cs> i am not quite clear what will be the source of a continuing income for the authority <e> <s> it will have a permanent staff and will require a permanent income <e> <s> is the authority to live wholly upon the fees which it receives from fresh applications <e> <s> those must dry up eventually <e>", "<cs> where there are competitors for a licence the price that they are going to charge the public must be an important factor in the choice of which company is to have the licence <e> <s> surely that must be so <e> <s> that is the intention of the provision <e>", "<cs> is the noble baroness saying that the clause is not to be read as meaning <e>", "<cs> when i read the noble lords amendment <e> <s> i immediately endeavoured to find out whether the same thing had been done before local radio <e> <s> i am very glad to learn that it was <e> <s> it seems to me an immensely practical and useful suggestion and i should have thought that a cabling company would eagerly seize this idea and find that it would get great help in the district in which it was operating

will stand by this <e> <s> there is nothing to prevent the authority from seeking help and advice from the advertising standards association <e> <s> they can go to all of them they do not have to consult the iba exclusively <e> <s> i would have thought that the iba would be the first place that a wise authority would go to <e>", "<cs> surely it does say precisely that that only those programmes which are analogous to those on ita should be subject to this limitation <e>", "<cs> there seems to be agreement that some kind of remedy some kind of halfway house <e>", "<cs> i have a good deal of sympathy with this amendment <e> <s> it really is an extraordinary situation you have one set of companies cable operators who provide the programmes to the public you have a set of companies called cable providers and each of these kinds of company has to apply to different ministries for licences to work the system <e> <s> but of course this is further complicated by the fact that many cable operators or would-be cable operators have also ambitions to become cable providers <e> <s> it was these circumstances where you have competition between several companies who aspire to both these aims going to the authorities and one authority opting for one company and the other authority opting for another that led the white paper to say that there must be a priority and the priority must be for the cable operating company which is actually going to provide the services <e> <s> the white paper was very clear on the subject and the notes on clauses were even clearer <e>", "<cs> i wish to support this amendment also <e> <s> the service should not only be continued under the new system but should be very much improved <e> <s> perhaps because it is rather costly it is the worst of the telephone services <e> <s> one rings and then waits for a long time and one is lucky to get an answer then there seem to be people of no very great skill at the other end <e> <s>

for these services <e> <s> i think it is essential that these services should be continued and should be substantially improved <e>", "<cs> i have a good deal of sympathy with the words that the noble earl has just uttered and a good deal of sympathy too with the first part of the amendment <e> <s> it seems to me obvious that there have to he legislative arrangements for collaboration <e> <s> in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a good deal of sympathy with the noble lords opposite who have proposed this amendment <e> <s> nevertheless it is difficult to see what further compromise there could be between the rights of operators to refuse unwelcome variations and the rights of the authority to impose what changes it thinks are essential <e> <s> but surely given this time which they now have to formulate their views the operators have an opportunity for uttering public cries of agony if they feel that they are unjustly treated <e> <s> they can subject the authority to public and political criticism if their cause is just and if the authority became unreasonable and ceased to exercise its powers in a manner best calculated to promote the provision of a prescribed diffusion service if instead of the light hand it is supposed to use it actually imposed a dead hand <e> <s> surely the authority must have this power to vary <e> <s> therefore one must support the government in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not the swiftness of foot to get here until a moment after the house resumed but i have great confidence in the wisdom and experience of the noble lord lord aylestone and wish to support him in this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this is getting more and more complex as we go along <e> <s> it is a very difficult subject <e> <s> the hunt committee took one view of it

of the country it has been a complete flop and that people who are presented with new films would rather see excellent not-so-new films for free on the ordinary broadcasting service <e> <s> so pay-per-view is running into grave difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords what i am suggesting is that he can perhaps have all the events leading up to the protected events a protected snippet as it were

include that final in their package they are not selling it instead of saying to their viewers we have now reached the final switch over to the bbc channel in order to watch it <e> <s> can they broadcast it on the same cable channel <e>", "<cs> my lords this was a problem that concerned us <e> <s> we are most grateful to the noble lord for the action that he has taken <e>", "<cs> my lords at the beginning of the committee stage of this bill i regretted that we were legislating in the dark that we knew little of the concrete intentions of the would-be cable operators and that it was a pity

noble lord lord elton who has shown us so much help and courtesy during the course of this bill nevertheless began by gently rebuking me for starting the committee stage with second reading observations but i do not think those observations fitted into that category <e> <s> i was concerned that we were about to examine clauses and amendments about something which did not yet exist and could not be visualised with any accuracy <e> <s> even now we do not have an estimate of how many companies in how many areas would be offering how many channels in five or ten years time <e> <s> we do not know how many of those channels will be devoted to traditional broadcast entertainment and how many to new forms of communication <e> <s> will cable really give us local television and access television <e> <s> will there be sufficient revenue to encourage the programme providers to create new and original material <e> <s> i have grave doubts whether that is imminent <e>", "<cs> my lords i

hopeful and creative mood <e>", "<cs> my lords althought i am speaking from this privileged postion i am speaking entirely for myself and i am afraid that i am less in agreement with some of my noble friends than i am with other speakers in the debate <e> <s> i cannot be happy about any bill which brings government into censorship <e> <s> i profoundly regret that the video industry did not set up
