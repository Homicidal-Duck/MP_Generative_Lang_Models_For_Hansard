["<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am sorry that this debate is taking place on a thursday night when it is not very usual for us to have a full house here <e> <s> should have liked to see a bigger attendance <e> <s> although we have got three of the old guard from brussels here it would have been nice if some of the new members of the european parliament who are also members of this house had been able to come to this debate tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords the ministers reply in another place was not merely disappointing to those who had worked on this project for some years and thought they were on the verge of success <e> <s> it was also deeply unsatisfactory <e> <s> but now i think that the government themselves are learning that it is not good enough whenever an expenditure is to he cut or a proposed expenditure is to be turned down for a minister to shelter behind a few well-chosen words about the need for financial stringency <e> <s> we all know that there is such a need <e> <s> we all accept that the need for stringency is real <e>"]
