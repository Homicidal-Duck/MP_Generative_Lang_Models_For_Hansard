["<cs> my lords i extend my congratulations to my colleagues who have spoken in this debate and to the front bench opposite in the person of the noble viscount lord trenchard <e> <s> we have a strange way of encouraging and congratulating people in this house <e> <s> seldom have i heard such a barrage of advice criticism and questions as have been delivered from these benches this afternoon to a minister making his first appearance in an important economic debate <e>", "<cs> my lords keeping in mind that those members of this house most affected by the regional development grants order live out of town and try to get home to those regions at a reasonable hour on thursday and friday would the noble lord indicate when this debate might take place tomorrow <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord can guide us as to how many jobs are going to glasgow and how many to east kilbride <e> <s> he said to glasgow and east kilbride <e> <s> considering that the site on which the building is now being erected in glasgow was to accommodate civil servants would he indicate what are the net savings considering that they have already inherited substantial liabilities in the building of property to take the total of civil servants that was envisaged <e> <s> will the noble lord also accept that apart from the financial saving there are important social implications in taking fairly high-income civil servants to the city of glasgow which tends to be a depressed area because it is almost totally dependent <e>", "<cs> my lords i assume that in calculating net savings some assumptions are being made about the rental of the existing property commitment which there is in liverpool and which there will be in glasgow <e> <s> it might be interesting to find out how one assumes one is going to recover some of the costs of unlet property which is being developed in anticipation of a substantial move of this kind <e> <s> i subscribe completely to the ministers statement regarding the acceptability of scotland as a place to move to having myself moved a civil service department to edinburgh as chairman of the forestry commission <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord explain why the confidence that he has expressed in the future is not shared by the stock market <e>", "<cs> my lords i spend a good deal of my time travelling around the world financing industrial development and that travelling includes frequent visits to the developing countries and i want to ask the noble lord just what the impact of the administrative changes will be on the excellent liaison which exists between the department of industry and the overseas development ministry at the present time <e> <s> most countries which are engaged in financing international contracts particularly in the third world have very substantial subvention from their aid programmes <e> <s> it is a matter of vital importance to british industry that the continued relationship between the department of industry which sometimes influences aid expenditure should be continued because in many parts of the world british contracts are lost on account of the element of aid that is built into the bids of other competitive countries <e> <s> that is a matter which i should like to see clarified under the new arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for that interesting reply may i ask whether he will accept that this represents an alarming trend keeping in mind the need of this country to make the best use of its natural resources and keeping in mind also the fact that we import per cent <e> <s> of our entire timber requirements at a cost of billion per annum in the balance of payments <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that one of the difficulties at the moment is the intervention of environmental bodies between the planning authorities which frustrates and delays the forestry planting which is so necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the desire of the government to reduce the size and responsibilities of the civil service will they review the decision to transfer the responsibility for monitoring the affairs of rolls-royce and british leyland from the neb to the civil service <e> <s> these are major industries and responsibility for so monitoring performance can add substantially to the numbers employed in these civil service departments <e>", "<cs> may i say in support of the contribution which has just been made that it is of interest that when british rail had recently to withdraw their services to football matches <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to your lordships for failing to put my name down on the list of speakers at an early stage in this debate <e> <s> i do not propose to make a speech but merely to ask a question arising from some of the speeches that have been made this afternoon <e> <s> first i must declare an interest <e> <s> i am a trustee of the scottish civic trust and i attended a meeting last night with the trust at which the business covered two main items <e> <s> first we were identifying buildings of some architectural merit in order that they might be protected secondly we were substantially engaged in raising money in order to carry out that function <e> <s> i wonder whether it would be possible within this bill for the trustees to make funds available to organisations such as the civic trust which are engaged in activities which are complementary and <e>", "<cs> i hope that the committee will heed some of the advice offered by the noble lord lord jacques who has had a long and distinguished record as the chief executive of a very large retailing organisation and who has had the responsibility of interpreting law and applying it in his business <e> <s> if there is one area that causes difficulty it is this area of uncertainty with inevitable delays in interpretation of law <e>", "<cs> my lords the congratulations of this house are due to two noble lords <e> <s> first they are due to the noble earl lord listowel because i believe that this is the first legislature that has debated and discussed this important international document <e> <s> we are therefore indebted to him for having given us the opportunity of a first <e> <s> secondly the congratulations of the house are of course due to the noble lord lord chorley who spoke with such distinction and knowledge of the subject that is before us <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not suggesting for a moment that the countryside commission has powers to stop <e> <s> i was referring to a particular case as regards which negotiations had been going on for four or five years and which in fact had been cleared by the national parks planning committee in the area concerned the nfu and the forestry commission after consulting the local amenity bodies <e> <s> at a late stage which was very distressing for the seller concerned and which frustrated employment in that area of south wales there was intervention which prevented this integrated forestry and agricultural development <e> <s> i was referring to that belated intervention <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble lord lord glenkinglas for a moment my few minutes absence was entirely due to the fact that i was correcting that figure upstairs <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble earl but twice he has made reference to the free-for-all of the past <e> <s> i am wondering what past he is referring to because for so long as i can remember the forestry commission had to clear all land with the department of agriculture in scotland and the ministry in england before agreeing that land could be devoted to forestry <e> <s> there never has been a free-for-all and for at least the past or years the forsetry commission has instituted local regional advisory councils <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely conscious that the noble earl has given a very comprehensive reply to almost all the points raised <e> <s> however there is one specific point as regards which i wonder whether he would give me an assurance <e> <s> the matter was raised by the noble lord lord gisborough and it is a rather urgent matter in forestry affairs <e> <s> in so far as the forestry commission has recently advertised nursery stock presumably to meet its cash limits or for some other purpose and put that on the market pretty extensively to the detriment of the nursery owners and growers of this country i wondered whether that was in fact the declared policy of the forestry commission and whether it was approved <e>", "<cs> thank you very much my lords <e> <s> would the noble lord agree that much of the british rail land described by my noble friend consists of disused railway tracks which are long and narrow and with no opportunity for development and would he agree that the million contribution of the british rail property board to lessening the railway deficit last year was substantial and worthwhile <e>", "<cs> i do not propose at this stage at all to discuss the doctrine of whether we should have a greater degree of state involvement or private enterprise <e> <s> the government have made up their minds on that matter and frankly i go so far as to say that if private capital is available to support industrial development there is no reason why the state should be involved in financing such projects <e> <s> therefore i would try to look at this matter quite objectively as one would look at any financial proposition <e>", "<cs> the people who are going to administer these cash limits are not the government are not the people who are creating a soft atmosphere or a soft option <e> <s> they are hardheaded businessmen <e> <s> i am simply asking that we trust the judgment of these substantial people who presently man the neb the sda the welsh development agency and so on <e>", "<cs> i hope that there will be some clarification on this particular point <e> <s> i am glad that the narrow reference to a religious objection has now been departed from because i happened to be involved in the dismissal of the railway employees <e> <s> it is an act of which i am ashamed but as a member of the board i had no option than to operate the closed shop implications and dismissal <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord tell us who would decide this <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i wonder whether i may pursue the question that i put <e> <s> he said that we should decide the range and type of services which the bbc should provide and make finance available accordingly <e> <s> i am interested to know what he had in mind when he said we should decide <e> <s> is it the government or the new institution <e> <s> what had he in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord concludes this interesting debate may i ask him one question <e> <s> i apologise for not giving notice of it <e> <s> he talked about the limits on bbc borrowing <e> <s> is the bbc limited in its borrowing by the same constraints as apply in other public industries or have the bbc examined the prospect of financing some of the requirements by leasing devices or other devices which would attract money from the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said that cruise missiles would be made available to the nato alliance that of these would he stationed in this country <e> <s> can he tell us whether all of the countries of the nato alliance have agreed to have these cruise missiles stationed in their territories and if that is not the case which countries have refused <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord accept that this is an industry in which regulation is essential and that the civil aviation authority is the appropriate authority to weigh up all aspects of applications for licences <e> <s> is there a precedent for the secretary of state overturning a decision of the civil aviation authority <e> <s> does it not undermine the authority of the caa in viewing future licences or is it now government policy that there has to be a free for all on many other routes <e> <s> is that the logic of the decision in this particular case <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that the reason ferranti was taken into part public ownership was the fact that the company had gone bankrupt or had suffered very substantial losses and required a rescue operation <e> <s> is he satisfied that the management and structure of ferranti now privatised once more will respond to the market in a way that will make it continually prosperous <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord indicate how many governments require to endorse the agreement reached on the common fund before it becomes operative <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that in the nationalised sector the awards that have now been made give rise to certain anomalies <e> <s> the going rate for increases in many of the nationalised industries at the moment is around per cent <e> <s> that applies right through up to management level whereas board members and nationalised chairmen are being awarded per cent <e> <s> it makes board membership extremely unattractive to executives in various nationalised industries <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord confirm that the sums he has quoted plus the tax liability of the independent companies represent about per cent <e> <s> of their revenues <e>", "<cs> after hearing the noble lord lord strathclyde speak i cannot help thinking that tonight this is a re-union of glasgow town council since the noble lord lord strathclyde and the noble lord lord galpern were frequently involved in the affairs of that city <e> <s> i can speak for the city just as the noble lord lord mackie of benshie can speak for the rural areas and it is a city in which catering for the disabled and the elderly is a real social problem <e> <s> even if the words are not as clearly defined as the noble earl would wish i suggest that the restrictions imposed by the clause are bound to hurt at least one or two people <e> <s> the provisions are bound to restrict the availability of houses for elderly and disabled persons <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the political initiatives that have been taken by the french and german governments would the noble lord give an assurance to this house and also to british industry which is engaged in trading with the ussr that they are in no way disadvantaged in the present circumstances in credit terms or by political constraints following the initiatives of our allies <e> <s> whereas we seem to observe all the regulations and agreements which have been reached within the allied group <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask since we in fact began negotiations on revised credit terms whether credit terms that will be agreed by great britain will be observed by all others who offer credit terms within the alliance <e>", "<cs> as a scot i am sorry to intervene in what is a welsh affair but i have some responsibility as a director of an independent television company and i declare an interest <e> <s> i was interested in the reference to the funding of the programme and i wondered whether the noble lord would tell us a little more about the calculations that were made on the cost of the programme and on the funding <e> <s> so far as i could gather there were to be three sources of funding one is the advertising revenue and since this is a minority programme it is unlikely to attract mass advertising revenue <e> <s> to that extent the welsh programme will sustain a continuing and quite substantial deficit <e> <s> if i understand the minister aright this deficit will be met from two sources first the bbc will provide programmes free and any additional cost incurred by the bbc as a result of that activity may be recovered in an adjustment of the licence fee <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord donaldson of kings-bridge has said the significance of this debate is that it reflects the depth of feeling on this matter and i am quite sure that the new authorities responsible for the fourth channel will take heed of that depth of feeling even if this amendment is defeated or withdrawn <e> <s> it is on record that this committee feels strongly on this particular issue and they would be failing in their duty if they did not pay heed to that <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble earl lord de la warr and to say that those of us who have had experience of submitting rate cards to price commissions and other bodies realise all the bureaucratic interference with the market which was so frustrating and unfair to television companies <e>", "<cs> reference has been made to the activities of the press council as a precedent in <e>", "<cs> like the noble lord lord hill i find this a rather difficult decision to make <e> <s> but on balance and in the light of my own personal experience in independent television i am inclined to support the noble lord lord belstead <e> <s> i think that the complaints commission is designed to give a reasoned judgment on a matter of complaint <e> <s> if it is held in the full glare of publicity there is the danger of the <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has said that he is anxious to protect the writer and the producer the point made by the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge <e> <s> but the writer and the producer are more likely to be protected in a private hearing than in the full glare of publicity <e> <s> the whole of his future career might be affected if he were subjected to a public inquiry and public exposure <e>", "<cs> a great deal has been said about the view of the scottish people and if the view of the scottish people is to be interpreted in terms of the number of contributions in this house in favour of or against the clause it would suggest that the scottish people are opposed <e> <s> apart from the <e>", "<cs> well they are sad <e> <s> they are sad and they are misfits in our community and there are occasions where we have to provide with sympathy and understanding for these misfits <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that the difficulties of british rail are attributable not to the fare structure but to the lack of investment at british rail which prevents them from offering an efficient and adequate service <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but perhaps he could enlighten us as to what is the total population of anguilla <e> <s> the amount of aid that is about to be contributed adds up to about a million pounds <e> <s> i am not against that but i am wondering whether the capital aid projects were related to british products and british production or unrelated to the source of supply <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble earl for repeating the long-awaited statement on the future of forest policy <e> <s> i should like to commend the earlier part of the statement in which he assured us that a continuing expansion in forestry is in the national interest <e> <s> we have always believed that forestry required a very long-term view to be taken and the continuing commitment of the government to the support of forestry is welcomed i am sure in the public sector as well as in the private sector <e> <s> i very much support the sentence in the statement to the effect that looking further ahead our industries with the more advanced processes being developed in this country are capable of absorbing the rising production <e> <s> at the present time we have the ridiculous situation of pulp wood from scotland being exported to scandinavia to be re-imported into scotland as pulp and paper with all the added value involved <e> <s> i am quite sure this is a temporary difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may ask one more question <e> <s> in the event of certain assets belonging to the forestry commission being sold or being involved in leaseback arrangements with consequent revenue will these revenues accrue to the forestry commission for further development and planting or will they be simply taken by the treasury <e>", "<cs> my lords yesterday a statement was made by the government about support for the development of domestic forestry as a supplier to the paper and pulp industry <e> <s> is not the noble lords answer today inconsistent with the statement made yesterday <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord <e> <s> i wonder whether i may return to the question raised by the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley and ask whether in regard to the cutbacks that have been announced there has been any assessment of the consequences in terms of employment <e> <s> i am concerned not simply about local authority employment but about the fact that this involves cutting back on capital items such as the replacement of vehicles from british leyland or cutting back the construction industry which may put more people out of employment as claimants on the psbr when i understand that the whole purpose of the exercise is to prevent an increase in the public sector borrowing requirement <e>", "<cs> my lords my qualification for entering this debate is twofold <e> <s> many years ago i sat on the glasgow city council with the noble lord lord strathclyde who i see on the benches opposite <e> <s> my other qualification is the fact that i live in the much-maligned strathclyde region and perhaps experience of the strathclyde region is more relevant to the debate with no disrespect to caithness and ross and cromarty where a very small proportion of the total number governed exist <e>", "<cs> my lords in his statement the noble earl made certain specific assumptions with regard to first the level of wage settlements at per cent <e> <s> and secondly the rate of inflation in the period covered by the rate support grant of per cent <e> <s> i wonder whether in his economic projections he made any assumptions with regard to the consequences of these in relation to unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords the question is simply that the noble earl made some assumptions in connection with the inflation rate and the wage settlement <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to prohibit the organisation of boxing matches for profit <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords who have spoken in the debate i have to declare an interest i am the chairman of a company that is concerned with the attraction of investment to forestry <e> <s> i apologise at the outset to the noble lords lord sherfield and lord dulverton for being absent at the beginning of the debate <e> <s> monday is not the best day to travel from scotland to london and i hope that when we come to debate the forestry bill some concern will be paid to the difficulties of travelling such a long way and perhaps it will be possible to have those debates mid-week <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord dulverton <e> <s> i know that in addition to the edinburgh university studies the noble lord himself has instituted independent studies on his own estates which have borne out the figures that i have just read <e> <s> let me say just a word about tax incentives because there has been a good deal of misunderstanding on this <e> <s> i am in favour of tax incentives to private planters who take the long view of an investment and are prepared to accept a per cent <e> <s> return on investment in forestry as against the current rates which can be attractive to private investors in the market <e> <s> i think there have got to be incentives for private investment and this is one of the fine things about forestry <e> <s> we established a partnership in forestry <e> <s> the forestry commission was not simply an instrument for state forestry the forestry commission is a forest authority with a research department with its grant facilities and with its dedication schemes all designed to encourage private forestry <e> <s> we should get that kind of partnership in other sectors of the british economy <e> <s> here are two sectors in the same industry working together in harness for mutual benefit and i would be very sorry indeed if any measures which the government introduce in the forestry bill should upset that kind of partnership <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may interrupt the noble lord for one moment <e> <s> while accepting that pension funds and insurance companies may wish to invest in forestry there is nothing to stop them investing in forestry now <e> <s> it is a free market <e> <s> why is it necessary to dispose of forestry commission assets to do this <e> <s> pension funds and insurance companies can buy the land now and invest if they so desire <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down may i say that it was suggested by several noble lords that a forestry minister should be appointed as distinct from the triumvirate which now operates forestry policy the welsh office the scottish office and the department of agriculture which at times makes for a great deal of difficulty in getting decisions <e> <s> i wondered whether with his vast experience he would like to comment on that proposition <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a very important statement and will inevitably arise in the debate on the second reading of the forestry bill <e> <s> in the event the noble earl said it is a treasury bill and therefore there are certain treasury targets established as to the amount the forestry commission has to realise every year <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i apologise but that seemed to be the interpretation of the minister in the debate in the other place <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl say whether the figure that he is quoting is for outright sales and how much of that is sale and lease <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord confirm whether the government at present have powers to intervene in scotland or whether additional legislation is required to exercise the same kind of intervention as applies in england <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl say whether the ruling of the european commission on human rights in the british rail employees case has any relevance to this case <e>", "<cs> my lords it is an honour and a pleasure to be the first to congratulate the right <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the continued postponement of this conference causes great concern to british industry since the brandt report is concerned not simply with aid but with the development of trade between north and south <e> <s> the continued postponement can have serious consequences for industrial regeneration in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to be associated with the plea made by the noble earl lord longford this evening that the government should take urgent steps to provide more effective support for mental after-care <e> <s> i believe the noble lord lord lloyd stated that his was almost a maiden speech and he will forgive me if i do not congratulate him on an almost maiden speech but may i simply add that this debate on an unstarred question gives me the opportunity of making a maiden speech from these elevated benches <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord cullen of ashbourne has of course spoken on behalf of the department of health and social security whose responsibilities are for england and wales <e> <s> may i suggest to him that the concern that has been expressed this afternoon is equally applicable to scotland <e> <s> can i have the noble lords assurance that the content of this excellent debate will be conveyed to his right honourable friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord accept first that this is a matter of multilateral world disarmament and secondly that this is a matter of the highest priority in any reasonable persons thinking and that it requires some allocation of resources and funds on the part of the united nations to study this problem which is worrying the whole of mankind <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether alongside the restriction he has discussed there was any substantial encouragement given to japanese investment in the united kingdom as a means of rectifying this imbalance <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble viscount tell us what is being done to maintain the level of research and development in the equally important public sector <e> <s> is he aware that the research and development departments of many of the public sector industries which are innovative are being restricted by the constraints of the public sector borrowing requirement <e>", "<cs> my lords on forestry matters i have to declare an interest <e> <s> i was for some years chairman of the forestry commission for which organisation i have developed a great affection and admiration and i am chairman of a forestry company in the private sector and i suppose to that extent i can take a reasonably objective view of these proceedings <e> <s> i am sorry that the debate is being held this morning <e> <s> your lordships have shown great interest in forestry matters over the years and it might have been better had we been able to delay the second reading of the bill so that other members of your lordships house who have an interest and experience in the matter might have been enabled to make their contributions <e> <s> in a way forestry is a long-term affair and there is no particular reason why we should expedite the bill especially when it is not a popular bill on either side of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl explain why the sale of plantable land will not in fact restrict the future planting programme of the forestry commission which is the point that lord dulverton had in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord leaves that point i wonder whether he would comment on the fact that the times newspapers acquisition was not referred to the monopolies and mergers commission <e> <s> the london evening dailies merger of which there is a complete monopoly in the london area was not referred to the monopolies and mergers commission and there was an immediate increase of per cent <e> <s> on the price of that article while the lonrho acquisition of the <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount accept that it presents a rather unfortunate image for britain that we are cutting back our commercial sales organisation but at the same time maintaining this sales capacity in defence equipment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord tell us what is the ecgd cover on romania and <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment moved in the name of the noble baroness lady jeger <e> <s> it has been said that what we are talking about is protecting existing rights in the forest <e> <s> what are these existing rights <e> <s> the annual report of the forestry commission reports that an estimated million day visits were made to commission land during the year and that million camper nights were spent on forestry commission property during the year <e> <s> to me that is an important right to protect <e> <s> the access to forest land which is taken advantage of to that extent should be protected in the legislation <e>", "<cs> the constitutional position of the forestry commission arises also in an amendment in my name amendment no <e> <s> and i would resist developing at this stage the argument on that account <e> <s> as a matter of interesting history i would point out that the forestry commission was set up before the structure of nationalised industries before morrison and consequently it had no regular constitutional basis <e> <s> i understand that the government at the time sent for the constitution of the church commissioners and started to model the forestry commission on that constitution <e> <s> so it remains a somewhat strange body not and it never has been accepted as a department of the government <e> <s> nevertheless so long as the forestry commission is dependent on grant in aid there will be a measure of government oversight from the treasury and as has been said previously in the debate the bill is all about the exercising of treasury control over forestry <e>", "<cs> everything has been said <e> <s> all that i want to add is a little historical note regarding the forest of dean <e> <s> it is almost years to the day when the speech house was opened in the forest of dean <e> <s> the speech house was opened in the forest of dean because of the fact that in the early th century the land the crown estates had been sold to a private owner <e> <s> the private owner promptly cut down most of the trees denuded the forest sold for profit and closed down the ironworks which were dependent upon timber <e> <s> the speech house was built as the centre of administration and activity in the forest with the purpose of protecting the rights of the people within the forest of dean <e> <s> it was totally ineffective <e> <s> riots and violence continued in the forest until subsequently a commission re-established constitutionally the rights of the people in the forest <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord accept that if large amounts of forestry land were unloaded on the market the inevitable consequence would be that the taxpayer would not gain the benefit of his investment <e>", "<cs> i must make clear my lack of enthusiasm for the concession that was made by the minister a few moments ago <e> <s> it is extremely difficult for me to consider dropping this amendment because if the minister is prepared to look at some form of limitation against the open-ended commitment of this bill then i and those of my noble friends who have supported this amendment would be happy to accept such an olive branch <e> <s> i hope that the combined wisdom of the noble lords who will look at this again will produce some formula <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the committee and to the minister in particular for not being in my place on the occasion of the amendment which covered the national trust for scotland <e> <s> i know that the noble earl lord wemyss had travelled especially from scotland to deal with that amendment <e> <s> since amendment no <e> <s> a by the noble lord lord dulverton covers the national trust situation in england i wondered whether the minister felt it right to comment on the position as it affected the national trust of scotland in similar circumstances <e>", "<cs> may i <e>", "<cs> i do not want to enter extensively into this argument but i want to say a word to my noble friend lord davies of leek <e> <s> forestry is a free market <e> <s> i am the chairman of a company which recently acquired on behalf of british investors million dollars worth of woodlands in georgia usa <e> <s> by the same token members of the eec can buy land in this country <e> <s> if they manage the land sensibly with proper respect for amenity and recreation and proper woodland management and they would only qualify under the dedicated scheme they would not be permitted to clear fell and sell they would presumably want to attract the maximum tax advantage by the dedication scheme <e> <s> to that extent they would be controlled in their management policies by the forestry commission <e> <s> i would not pursue too far the point of lord davies that a man if he is a greek is necessarily evil and necessarily a bad manager of the forest estate <e> <s> i believe in the economic community the noble lord lord davies does not <e> <s> i do not believe that there should be <e>", "<cs> with the assurances which have been given by the minister that these provisions will not affect the planting programme of the forestry commission and that these provisions have lost none of their statutory obligations and importance assurances which i am delighted to have and which i am prepared to accept i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the point made by the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> earlier in this debate the minister was good enough to quote the experience of other nationalised industries in respect of sales of assets <e> <s> if he will examine the transport bill currently before the house he will read that the disposal of british rail board assets are to be reinvested in british rail and do not become the property of the treasury when hotels and sealink and other assets are sold off <e> <s> all that is suggested here is that if you are selling off forestry commission land and assets at least the results of those disposals should be reinvested in the development of forestry <e> <s> that is what we are asking <e>", "<cs> the trade union representative is not written into the act as a specific commitment but is included by tradition <e> <s> as chairman of the forestry commission i tried not to have a specific trade union nominee as such <e> <s> i remember talking to the general secretary of the tuc and he said tom you need a bloody good trade unionist and so we got a bloody good trade unionist <e> <s> but that would not meet the case that i have in mind i want a bloody good forester instead <e>", "<cs> the act does not say that you should have a statutory trade unionist and i have not said that we ought to have a statutory trade unionist <e> <s> i have said that we ought to increase the number by two instead of one for the reasons i have indicated without writing into the bill that it must be a statutory trade unionist <e> <s> but it gives the opportunity for the minister to do what i have sought <e> <s> if you do not amend it now you are stuck with the number that is in the bill <e> <s> in fact you are adding one business man <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> would he indicate whether the independence date is in any way dependent on the acceptance of the treaty with guatemala or are these two issues to be separate in the referendum that might take place <e>", "<cs> my lords may i take the opportunity of wishing the foreign secretary well and to encourage him in the steps that he has taken and to hope that agreement will be reached at the discussions on th may in washington <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the statement of the minister and his refusal to comment on the content of news programmes by independent television or bbc <e> <s> would he say whether the same detachment was applied in the case of death of a princess <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to express my indebtedness to the noble baroness lady elles for introducing this very interesting subject <e> <s> it is a pity that it is a short debate because the whole question of the relationship between commercial policy and political strategy is an interesting theme and might be looked at in an even broader context than east/west trade <e>", "<cs> my lords one is tempted to <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl care to comment on the fact that people taking advantage of the youth opportunities scheme are paid only marginally more than they would receive in unemployment benefit <e> <s> does not the noble earl agree that since additional costs are incurred in the youth opportunities scheme to that extent there is a disincentive towards taking advantage of the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister two questions <e> <s> is it still the standing instruction of the government to the nationalised industries that they should in fact behave commercially <e> <s> if that is the standing instruction is this decision justified on commercial terms <e> <s> the retail trade is not particularly lively at present <e> <s> due to the high rates that exist in the country at the moment property values tend to be depressed <e> <s> may i ask whether anyone acting commercially at the board would regard this as an appropriate time for disposal of these assets <e> <s> may i also ask whether the realisations of these disposals will affect in any way the external finance limits and the investment ceilings of the board <e> <s> will they be credited with realisations of the assets for further investment purposes <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it would be possible to avoid treading the lobbies <e> <s> there has been a good deal of that on this bill and i hope that we shall divide on matters of fundamental importance <e> <s> this amendment refers to an administrative device and i am not convinced having heard the argument that questions of important principle arise <e> <s> i am influenced as a former member of an education committee of a local authority by the fact that these <e>", "<cs> we on these benches have tried to assess the various amendments and have tried to encourage the noble lord lord ross of marnock in supporting general principles rather than what we regarded as minor amendments <e> <s> however this is a matter of fundamental importance and we on these benches would certainly support the noble lord lord ross <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lord lord ross of marnock because this is a matter of great importance not only in the educational field but also because of its repercussions on the whole of the social structure in scotland <e> <s> i do not share the view that there should be separate schools for roman catholics and other denominations in the scottish educational system <e> <s> where over the years since we have been able to live with that system it has created within our community right from the outset substantial divisions not unlike the divisions which exist in belfast where catholic children are segregated from protestant children at a very early age <e> <s> that is at the root of a great deal of the troubles that follow therefrom but that is another side to it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware of the statement made by the leader of the greater london council to the effect that no further permissions will be granted by the planning authorities of that council for office development in london <e> <s> does he anticipate therefore a very considerable increase in the volume of appeals to his department arising from that view and can he also anticipate its effect on rental values in the city of london <e>", "<cs> my lords has the attention of the noble lord been drawn this morning to the result <e>", "<cs> before the amendment is called i should like to ask the minister a question <e> <s> as some of the amendments to this bill refer to the date of independence what is the justification for declaring on television last night and in the newspapers this morning a specific date for independence before this house has agreed the date <e>", "<cs> i accept that it was an agreement between the minister of state and the prime minister of belize but this bill is before the house and has to be approved before independence is granted and an appropriate date fixed in accordance with the decision of this house <e> <s> does that not anticipate a decision of this house before the decision is taken <e>", "<cs> i should like to support what has just been said by the noble lord lord stewart <e> <s> while these reassuring statements have been made from guatemala in the last few days may i recall that on st july guatemalas president general romeo lucas garcia voiced the hope that there would be a conclusion of a treaty but declared that meanwhile his government maintained all its claims and it would not recognise an independent belize created by unilateral british action <e> <s> general rodrigues the head of the defence department said that a unilateral declaration of independence would be opposed by the guatemalans <e>", "<cs> your lordships have been treated badly today <e> <s> we have been treated badly first by the government before this bill has been approved by the house making an announcement that there would be independence to belize on a certain date while a committee of this house by this amendment is discussing whether we should have a specific date for independence <e> <s> to that extent i think this house is entitled to protect its authority and if for no other reason i would welcome support in the division lobbies on this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords following the original question may i ask the noble lord whether his attention has been drawn to the article in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate the noble lord lord constantine of stanmore on his maiden speech and welcome his wise comment on the nationalised industries <e> <s> indeed his speech was the kind of speech that will be made i suspect from these benches on occasion <e> <s> i welcome the opportunity of this debate on the gracious speech because it enables us to do two things <e> <s> it enables us to state our policy the policy of the social democratic/liberal alliance on major issues of the day and it enables us to take stock of the performance of her majestys government <e> <s> the noble earl lord longford asked a question of the noble lord lord rochester as to whether we had a policy <e> <s> it will be interesting to hear the noble earl lord longford it a later stage telling us which particular policy of has party he subscribes to because obviously on this <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the desire of the government to introduce private capital into the nationalised sector have they looked at the possibility of financing the airport developments by private capital and leasing to the civil aviation authority <e> <s> is there any reason why such arrangements should be brought within the external finance limit of the psbr <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> while i speak from these benches i should emphasise that this is a private members bill and does not represent any party commitment so far as the social democratic party is concerned <e> <s> it is a bill to prohibit professional boxing and i suppose that the first question that will be asked is why i should revive this debate which seemed to die with the passing of the late lady summerskill <e>", "<cs> my lords it is punishable <e> <s> there are certain rules in rugby football which are designed to prevent the inflicting of injury by one man on another <e> <s> that is the distinction between rugby football and boxing <e> <s> in mountaineering steps are taken to minimise the risks to human life <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i do not wish to detain the house in replying to the debate but i should like to say a word in connection with the statement of the government <e> <s> with regard to the purpose of the bill it is not the intention of the bill as i made abundantly clear in my speech that amateur boxing should be prohibited <e> <s> this is a bill designed to prohibit professional boxing and if there is any doubt in the wording or the terms of the bill in distinguishing amateur from professional boxing that can be amended and made clear at the committee stage <e> <s> therefore todays debate on the second reading is about the prohibition of professional boxing <e>", "<cs> my lords an ordinary boxing match is not always decided on points <e> <s> i quoted the spectacle the other night in wembley stadium of a man who i forget the actual phrase inflicted brutality and punishment on a man in the th or th round and knocked him out <e> <s> that is the history of boxing and the victims of that are people who are wandering about poor wandering about punch-drunk mumbling and blind <e> <s> that is the difference between boxing and some of the other sports that were mentioned <e> <s> that should be kept in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there have been excellent crops in zimbabwe this year particularly of maize but they are unable to transport these food supplies to other parts of africa because of the collapse of the transport system <e> <s> would he regard efficient transport in the area as a top priority in any aid programme he proposes to support <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord comment as to whether the proposals for the sell-off of bnoc assets in the north sea is a disincentive to new developments and new investment in that area <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell us whether the proposed management audit of the nationalised industries to be undertaken by the monopolies and mergers committee will include some reference to the rights and protection of consumers within the management of these industries <e>", "<cs> the noble lord was asking about the provision to prevent them going into bankruptcy <e> <s> the point was made that they still have the right of appeal to the traffic commissioners in <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ross of marnock is perfectly right it is a matter of balance <e> <s> in any legislation we have a duty to provide two things in this regard first an adequate service to the public and secondly an adequate return to the man who is engaged in running a taxi business <e> <s> in relation to the first a substantial consumer interest is involved <e> <s> i was wondering whether the minister when he has undertaken to consult with the convention of scottish local authorities on this matter would also consult the consumer council in scotland <e> <s> when i get off the train from edinburgh to glasgow i regularly witness a long line of people waiting for taxis in the rain and just now in very inclement weather men women and children because there is not a very good public transport service to that part of town <e> <s> i see them waiting for a very long time unprotected from the elements <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that despite the anomalies which are created in neighbouring sites and neighbouring developments enterprise zones are welcomed particularly in areas of deep depression like clydebank in scotland and also in londons docklands <e> <s> but since it is essentially an experiment would the noble lord undertake to report after a reasonable period on the success or otherwise of this interesting experiment <e>", "<cs> my lords the view of the social democratic party was adequately explained by my noble friend lord aylestone <e> <s> incidentally he appeared to be the only speaker to accept the disciplines of a short debate and in the short time at my disposal i shall discard many of the things i had planned to say <e> <s> it is important to pay personal tribute to the noble lord lord noel-baker <e> <s> i thought it was just a little unfair of the noble lord lord beloff to suggest that lord noel-baker was a purveyor of platitudes and a provider of generalities <e> <s> if ever a man has witnessed not only for his pacifist belief and has sought to apply that faith in international conferences and gatherings to secure some practical reduction in armaments it has been lord noel-baker <e> <s> he is in a sense a conscience to us all and i admire his constancy of faith despite the many frustrations he must have suffered in the course of a life devoted to securing the peace of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord accept that while it is desirable for the nationalised industries to distinguish between capital and revenue expenditure it is equally desirable on the part of the treasury to distinguish between capital and expenditure projects in calculating the psbr and the external finance limits <e> <s> would the noble lord agree that if such a distinction were made it would enable the nationalised industries to invest substantially and to relieve unemployment <e>", "<cs> i was interested by the ministers statement with regard to the responsibilities of the regional council as distinct from the district council and whether there is some wisdom in the comment that has been made <e> <s> would he accept that in the scottish context of glasgow with relation to the stratclyde region there are special circumstances in which processions of one kind or another have a particular impact in the city of glasgow which is the district council as distinct from the region which is a very widely-spread organisation and is perhaps less conscious of the tensions involved in some of the so-called religious processions that take place from time to time in the city of glasgow <e>", "<cs> my lords the statement makes provision for the government paying million per month <e> <s> the proceedings of the european court have frequently taken a very long time <e> <s> can the minister give us any indication of the time scale of these proceedings and what the total commitment is likely to be until the proceedings are resolved <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for delaying the house but i did not hear the reply to the point raised by the noble lord lord bruce of donington as to the difference between the budget as established and the budget of the parliament <e> <s> is that quantified <e> <s> what is the difference between the budgets and will the payments of million per month be limited to that particular amount <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to apologise to the house for the fact that i must leave tonight by oclock <e> <s> if the debate goes on that long i will for the first time in this house like the noble lord lord rochester have to exercise this discourtesy which i do not normally apply <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord a question before he resumes his seat <e> <s> he mentioned that further consideration should be given to this matter on a tripartite basis of the union the government and the employers <e> <s> would he also suggest that the consumers may be represented in any discussion that may take place <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness before she resumes her seat whether if today she gets approval of the principle which is contained in her bill she will consider remitting it to a select committee of this house to take evidence from interested parties with a view to getting some greater agreement on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that it might be wise to re-examine not the amount but the basis on which compensation was calculated considering the fact that the basis of calculation particularly in the shipbuilding industry was totally inadequate for an assessment covering the compensation for the whole industry <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is indebted to the chairman of the scottish peers for introducing this debate on a scottish theme <e> <s> perhaps i may offer two general comments <e> <s> for a short debate the range of the discussion is rather widely spread i would suggest that scottish transport and scottish agriculture which are not necessarily related subjects might have separate days <e> <s> indeed i might go further and keeping in mind the excellent attendance of scottish peers here tonight we might even copy the members of another place who recently held a debate in edinburgh on the affairs of scotland <e> <s> this attracted a good deal of press publicity and a great deal of interest <e> <s> there were queues outside the public galleries hoping to listen to members of parliament debating scottish affairs <e> <s> perhaps scottish peers might consider in future changing the venue for this kind of debate <e> <s> this might bring great credit to scottish peers and even to the house of lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that the maintenance of good industrial relations is dependent on involvement of employees in the affairs of the company in which they are involved whether as civil servants or private enterprise employees and that the release of people in this field is extremely important to good industrial relations <e>", "<cs> my lords before dealing with the subject of the bill i too should like to add my word of tribute to the work done by sir derek ezra as chairman of the coal board <e> <s> his quiet efficiency has been impressive and while joining the noble lord lord strabolgi in that tribute i would not go along with him entirely on the job description for the new chairman of this nationalised industry <e> <s> i hope that the government will find a man who can interpret the policies of the government live with the treasury give leadership to the workforce and explain to the public the objectives of his business <e> <s> if the government get a man who has all those qualities they will be very fortunate <e> <s> i have never felt that the fact that peter parker never drove an engine made him a better chairman of the railways board <e> <s> so i wish the government well <e> <s> the appointment of chairmen of <e>", "<cs> my lords i too on behalf of my colleagues here would like to welcome the provisions contained in these regulations <e> <s> i should also like to pursue the question raised on index-linking which has become a very fashionable term these days <e> <s> i should like to know whether in view of the fact that the government borrowing is now to be index-linked together with taxation allowances we are passing regulations today which might be slightly out of date months from now and whether in fact index-linking was looked at in connection with the provisions in these regulations now before us <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my colleagues on these benches i should like to say that i feel the statement made by the minister will be greeted with some disappointment <e> <s> on monday of this week the house passed a bill increasing the borrowing limits of the coal board <e> <s> this was designed to enable the coal board to invest in new pits <e> <s> we were much encouraged by that gesture but the national coal board and the national union of mineworkers who have discussed this particular case at some length will be vastly disappointed by the statement which has just been made <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say a word in support of some of the matters raised by the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> i sat for a number of years on the valuation appeals court and the occupants of property received their assessment which was made to the best of his ability by the assessor and they had an opportunity of appealing <e> <s> we sat there and tried to make objective judgments within the law as to the rightness of the assessment <e> <s> then at the end of the day people went away and said we have had an opportunity of presenting our case <e>", "<cs> my lords before discussing the subject which has been introduced today by the noble lord lord beswick i feel it right perhaps to correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that the same difficulties have not arisen in some of the private industries <e> <s> the aslef dispute is something that i would not want to discuss today <e> <s> but i make the general point that there has been a substantial reduction in employment in many of the nationalised industries and they had to slim down in the same way as private industry in order to meet competitive circumstances <e>", "<cs> the properties of british rail are not based on borrowed money my lords <e> <s> br do not borrow money in the market to finance their property portfolio they are in possession of those properties and sites <e> <s> it is a question of the future development of those sites as a source of revenue for keeping the railways going <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much welcome the suggestion that we should be prepared to debate our manifesto <e> <s> unfortunately although in this house we have members we have not yet been afforded one day in which to sponsor a debate of that kind <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure to congratulate the noble lord lord cayzer on his maiden speech <e> <s> i am sure that the house is indebted to him for bringing to our consideration of this problem of transport his wide knowledge and great experience particularly in shipping <e> <s> the noble lord will perhaps forgive me if i do not endorse some of the strictures and criticisms that were offered of the railway system <e> <s> this is a matter to which i may perhaps return <e> <s> i should like to apologise to the house <e> <s> i put down my name for this debate assuming that there would be no major interruption in the course of this afternoons proceedings <e> <s> i must leave the house at <e> <s> i sought an alternative speaker from these benches at the last moment but it was not possible <e> <s> perhaps the minister and the house will accept my apology <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the rather small limited amount of land that is disclosed in the registers is it the intention of the minister to provide a local authority register of privately-held land which might be suitable for development <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down and i bow to his knowledge on these matters does he think that the submission of the amersham issue to parliamentary debate would have helped the procedure at all <e> <s> the decision on the value of the shares at issue is a highly sophisticated process <e> <s> it involves some judgment of the market and is hardly the kind of subject that lends itself to parliamentary debate <e> <s> under these circumstances i at least and i <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the minister questions on two matters on which there appeared to be some disagreement <e> <s> i should like to say that i am delighted that there was so much agreement among the parties concerned and we very much welcome these kind of regular meetings of heads of state which can do only good though they may not produce dramatic and revolutionary changes overnight <e> <s> the two issues on which there appeared to be some divergence of view occur in relation to east-west trade in which it appears that the european countries take a less rigid view of trading relationships with the soviet union than does the united states <e> <s> the words quoted in the statement arc that in future ecgd arrangements commercial prudence would be observed <e> <s> it might be interesting to get a clearer definition of what is commercial prudence <e> <s> i mention this because if we take a specific issue on this the soviet-european gas pipe-line on which john brown engineering is sitting on an order of million at clydebank incidentally it might be interesting to know whether the gas pipe-line was specifically referred to and whether that is within the terms of commercial prudence since it is obviously very important in terms of employment <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the statement of the minister and his commitment to support british exports <e> <s> i can vouch for <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister in his enthusiasm to boost british exports care to <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to thank the noble lord lord bellwin for his usual courteous and lucid explanation of the bill <e> <s> i agree with him that transport is an important aspect of the nations infrastructure and it is right that there should be a succession of bills that take account of the changing pattern of transport and its needs <e> <s> the noble lord will forgive me however if i say that i am not totally convinced by his conviction that this particular bill makes any major contribution to achieving the ends that he has in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord coleraine on his maiden speech <e> <s> once again it has emerged in this house that we have a great fund of knowledge and expertise in the various subjects that are discussed <e> <s> i hope we shall hear more from the noble lord <e> <s> i should like to apologise too to the noble lord lord vaizey <e> <s> i am sure he will understand that the difficulty of getting from an airport to this house is considerable these days <e> <s> indeed it was much quicker to fiy from scotland to london than it was to get from victoria into the city today <e>", "<cs> i rise to my feet because of the comments made by the noble lord lord oram and i would suspect that anyone who is dismissed for stealing spare parts or failure to turn up to work on time can be legitimately dismissed and can take his case to the industrial tribunal where it can be discussed <e> <s> what we are discussing today is the dismissal of people who fail to join a union and a closed shop agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords we join with the spokesman from the labour party and also the spokesman from the liberal party who expressed their concern about this move and the fact that local democracy appears to be diminished by the development in the interests of an anticipated but not proven efficiency <e> <s> the abolition of the national water advisory council is a matter which gives us some concern because that was a clearing house for interests in this country which use water in the amenity and recreation field <e> <s> there are conflicting interests in this field in the use of water by speedboats anglers or whatever <e> <s> there is also a growing utilisation of water facilities for recreation sailing fishing and so on <e> <s> i would welcome some advice <e> <s> while i support the idea that consumers are perhaps underrepresented in the new provisions i would welcome some assurance from the minister that the recreation and amenity interests which are involved in the water business are duly protected <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that the shortage referred to is a shortage not of food but of credit and that to make some impact in reducing interest rates might make it possible for the purchasing countries to buy food and to feed their people <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches regret that a statement of this kind has to be made today <e> <s> at the same time we understand and support the decision taken by the british rail board in their endeavours to bring the railways system in the united kingdom up to the modern standards that are observed in most european railways <e> <s> i support the proposition that was made that we do not want an embittered workforce <e> <s> is the minister aware that no one has done more to build the morale of the workforce in british railways than their present chairman <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord the minister sits down will he just compare this with the practice in the ptes with which he is familiar and in which there is not necessarily an exclusion of one form of transport to the advantage of another but where the services are integrated and complementary <e> <s> is this not the general philosophy contained in this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we very much welcome the statement made by the minister <e> <s> may i assure him that the statement will be even more than welcome in clydebank where john brown operates and where unemployment is close to per cent <e> <s> of the population of that town <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble lord one or two questions <e> <s> the first is whether in fact despite the delay in the execution and acceptance of this contract and the fact that export credit terms have changed in relation to the soviet union in the past few days the contract will be recognised on the export terms on which the contract was originally based <e>", "<cs> my lords is the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the success of stirling university one of the universities most severely affected by the cuts in attracting industrial development to the campus of the university in the form of an investment by a large united states computer company <e> <s> could he encourage other universities to follow similar initiatives <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased that there are some in the house like the noble lord lord melchett who are concerned about conservation and wildlife protection but i cannot help feeling that i have been round this course before when i was chairman of the forestry commission <e> <s> whenever we endeavoured to plant up some new area in the scottish highlands we had the regular pressures from so-called conservationists whose only concern was that the countryside which they knew and recognised and in which they were brought up should not be changed <e> <s> in a sense they were conservationists but they were conservatives in the extreme <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the dependence of the soviet economy on the imports of american wheat and on the supply of european technology to sustain their economy is not this the right moment to press the soviet government for new initiatives in this direction of securing a greater degree of multilateral disarmament <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble earl the minister for his statement on this important subject and congratulate him and the government if not on the timing of the issue at least on adopting the tender technique in this case <e> <s> he may be interested to observe that todays price of amersham is p against an issue price of p/p <e> <s> i should like the noble earl to give me his comment on the question of the timing of the issue <e> <s> while he has quoted a per cent <e> <s> appreciation in the

welcome him to the house of lords and make him feel that he should not be apprehensive about intervening in subsequent debates <e> <s> we have heard a speech this afternoon not only from a great and distinguished trade union leader but also from a great patriot <e> <s> the important message which he has brought to us is one which commends itself to these benches in so far as he has urged us not to be a divided community and to think in terms of national welfare <e> <s> the noble lord lord gormley brought great wisdom and wise judgment to the national union of mineworkers and i am sure that we are all delighted that the legacy he has left with the num has not been totally forgotten <e> <s> he may in fact find the atmosphere in this house a little more pleasant than it was in the latter days during his presidency of that great trade union so we welcome him here <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to measure this bill against the problem as i see it in scotland and to quote one or two figures in connection with mental health <e> <s> in the admissions to scottish psychiatric hospitals were <e> <s> first admissions were but readmissions numbered <e> <s> that indicates that the problem is not being tackled effectively since the readmissions were of people who had been mentally ill and who had got into the revolving door principle of being out for a brief period and back in again for treatment <e> <s> it is a very serious problem in scotland and a very serious problem nationally <e> <s> the cost of in-patient care for the mentally disordered in the national health service in was no less than million <e> <s> the number of beds occupied in scotland by the mentally ill was something like per cent <e> <s> of all beds available in scottish hospitals <e> <s> this indicates the size of the problem with which this bill is designed to deal <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the final paragraph of the statement which refers to increasing the quotas to the international monetary fund will be greatly welcomed and has had today an immediate response from the united states in so far as it too has indicated that it is prepared to increase quotas to the imf and that this should lead to a greater degree of financial stability in international banking affairs and encourage world trade <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the export credits guarantee department is in fact an insurance organisation and is perhaps not the appropriate organisation for making loans <e> <s> on the other hand can the minister assure us that the terms applied by the ecgd are subject to consensus agreement with other countries and that it would be unwise to get into a credit competition with some of the other lenders in international fields <e>", "<cs> my

an unstarred question <e> <s> i hope that at some time in the business arrangements of the house we might be able at an earlier hour to spend a little more time on the very fundamental issues which have been raised by the noble lord <e> <s> i should like to say too that not only the house but the country is indebted to the noble lord lord lever for consistently drawing our attention in speeches in articles and in private conversations to the growing seriousness of the issues which he raises <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down there were specific suggestions made and specific answers called for such as by the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls who has just raised a question <e> <s> are the government now committed fully to a substantial increase in the imf quotas are the

consumers of the service of mental care should perhaps be represented on this commission <e>", "<cs> may i encourage the minister to read the last report of the mental welfare commission for scotland which is titled <e>", "<cs> in view of the fact that we are to consider government amendment no <e> <s> which deals with this matter at this stage i am prepared to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i hope that the points made will be taken care of as the minister assures us they will in the amendment which he is to move <e> <s> i beg leave therefore to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i accept the noble lords assurance that the government will look at the positive functions of the commission but the noble lord has not replied on the more general functions of the commission in its duties to conduct research or ascertain and monitor the performance of local authorities and other bodies in this area <e> <s> i am not sure that amendment no <e> <s> covers this point but i await with interest the statement on amendment no <e> <s> and will accept the assurance given by the noble lord lord lyell in respect of the introduction of responsibility for ascertainment being a function of the commission <e>", "<cs> i support the noble lord lord ross of marnock because amendment no <e> <s> in my name requires an annual report <e> <s> if we pass the government amendment now i am not sure what happens to amendment no <e> <s> in which an annual report is called for <e> <s> like the noble lord lord ross i think the important item in the governments amendment is not the annual report though that is important but the mere fact that the government have in the amendment responded to some of the suggestions that have been proposed in earlier amendments and to some of the representations that have been made by the scottish association for mental health and other bodies <e> <s> it is an indication which we very much welcome <e>", "<cs> in view of the ministers assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the problem could be resolved by the minister giving an undertaking <e> <s> he has now accepted that there will be a report at least every second year after the passing of the act the commission will report every two years <e> <s> perhaps there could be an undertaking that the report of the commission will in fact be an assessment of the adequacy of the services such as the noble lord lord ross of marnock has suggested <e> <s> it is the duty of the commission to measure how far their remit is being carried out <e> <s> would the report of the commission be some kind of assessment in that direction <e> <s> i am not sure whether the noble lord lord ross would accept that as adequate <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i have been unable to convince the minister about the wisdom of this amendment <e> <s> it goes to the root of what we visualise as being the responsibility of the mental welfare commission <e> <s> i see that body as a body of equals sitting there as a board sits with certain responsibilities <e> <s> but what you are creating is a board of or people with a few laymen on the board and some lawyers there may even be someone from the voluntary organisations and then you are to have three medical people <e> <s> this is not a professional board <e> <s> this is largely a voluntary board to which people give their services <e> <s> these are matters of complaint where someone has taken the initiative in complaining about wrongful detention <e> <s> they are matters concerning the duties and responsibilities of the hospital when caring in which you have to have objective judgment and to employ three members of the board to conduct that inquiry is not sound <e>", "<cs> it is difficult of course to make complaints against the commission <e> <s> i am happy that the minister is prepared to look at the matter again because it impinges on a point made by the noble lord lord ross the question of fees and duties and i presume that the medical members of the commission as well as being a distinct category on the commission which i do not think they should be they should all be equal on the commission when discharging their responsibilities as medical members then collect their professional fees from the commission <e> <s> i do not quibble about that <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if it will help to progress the business of the committee in view of the fact that the minister apparently accepts amendment no <e> <s> because it is less complicated and would entail less legislation than amendment no <e> <s> i am not sure if i may say so to the noble baroness lady masham that there is a unanimous view in the organisations that we are dealing with in england that the english terminology is better than that produced elsewhere <e> <s> i would simply beg leave to withdraw my amendment on the assurance of the minister that he accepts it in principle and will look at this matter further <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl agree that the privatisation of bnoc and the fact that britoil is now the exploration arm in the north sea limits the governments ability to take initiatives in this field whereas bnoc which was government-owned could be an instrument of government policy in this area <e> <s> would the noble earl also agree that by the privatisation arrangements we have lost the ability to take the initiative in this direction <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to associate those on these benches with the congratulations and thanks of other noble lords to sir david serpell for a number of years a former colleague of mine on the british rail board <e> <s> i very much respect his judgment and his wisdom <e> <s> may i add my personal congratulations to the noble lord lord bellwin as this is the first opportunity i have had of addressing a question to him since his elevation <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords my name is not down for the debate and i wanted to ask two simple questions <e> <s> first there is before the european court a case initiated by mr kirk as to the legality of quota arrangements within the community <e> <s> does the new agreement which has just been signed mean that his case now falls or will it be proceeded with <e> <s> it would be most unfortunate if the court found against him <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment moved by the minister and say how much we appreciate how helpful the minister has been in relation to not only this amendment but subsequent amendments which he will submit later by which he indicates that he listened to the arguments and tried to accept them where they seemed to be reasonable <e> <s> the minister has been kind enough to write to several of us who participated in the debate and the comments and the advice given between the committee stage and report stage have been extremely helpful to all of us who are trying to make a good bill out of what should have been a separate bill and not an amended bill <e> <s> with that reservation i should like to support the amendment and accept the proposition which the minister has submitted to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for his suggestion <e> <s> i want to make only two remarks very briefly <e> <s> first my amendment does not reflect on the professionalism the abilities or the integrity of the officers who operate under the present scheme <e> <s> am simply concerned with a change in the function and the structure of the commission <e> <s> as the minister has said there has been no evidence in the past but as the noble lord <e> <s> lord ross of marnock has said we are talking about a new commission with new responsibilities and new tasks and therefore the evidence of the past has perhaps less relevance in that argument <e> <s> i very much welcome the ministers assurance of a further look at this matter and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support the amendment for this important reason when a government department or a public body of this kind reports invariably the report is published and reaches the press <e> <s> i am anxious that the public in scotland should be regularly informed of the new work of this commission and how it is being discharged and that mental health should be a subject of very regular debate in local authorities which are given new responsibility under the bill <e> <s> that debate can be kept alive by the fact that an annual report is given to the public and to the press and people can talk about it and discuss it in this house in the press or elsewhere <e> <s> the forestry commission for which i have had some responsibility in the past reports annually as is the case with other commissions over which the secretary of state presides <e> <s> this is a good thing <e> <s> people debate and discuss the annual report <e> <s> i would suspect that the care of the mentally ill is equally important and i strongly support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord ross <e>", "<cs> my lords though i was absent when my earlier amendment was called i understand that one of my colleagues was present on my behalf <e> <s> however despite the absence of my eloquence on that occasion the minister has been persuaded by the noble lord lord ross and by the feelings expressed in your lordships chamber <e> <s> this is a very important amendment and it lays firmly and squarely at the door of the local authorities responsibility to discharge this duty <e> <s> the minister has already indicated that he wants the bill dealt with expeditiously tonight and so i should like to say that the presence of the amendment which i presume will be carried will certainly mean that we shall not move our later amendment amendment no <e> <s> which details the after-care responsibilities of local authorities <e> <s> like the noble lord lord ross i should like to express my appreciation of the extremely helpful way in which the minister and his officials have pursued taken up and been influenced by the arguments which arose from many of the originally contentious proposals in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether the reduction in regional support which is envisaged in these figures indicates a change of policy on the part of the government keeping in mind the extreme demands of the regions in areas of high unemployment for regional support of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches would not oppose the proposals contained in the order <e> <s> we believe that the boundary commission has an extremely difficult job in the very nature of the geographical distribution in scotland and the fact that there is a heavy concentration of population in the industrial centres stretching from glasgow to edinburgh <e>

objectivity which has been the basis of the proposals in the order <e>", "<cs> my lords at the time of the last debate which was on th december the international banking crisis was at its height <e> <s> since then there has been the rescheduling of the debts of mexico and brazil polands position has been temporarily relieved there are hopeful signs of increased imf quotas and the bis has relieved the pressure by bridging loans <e> <s> the proposed clearing house for information on the viability of borrowers in washington has now been established and even the new governor of the bank of england has said with more optimism than appears justified that <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches should like to thank the minister for the statement he has made and to join in the congratulations to mr norman siddall for a year of very distinguished service despite the fact that he was not very well during that period and took these responsibilities with some reluctance <e> <s> we should also like to pay tribute to mr macgregors outstanding ability and to wish him well in his new post <e> <s> at the same time we should like to ask the government whether this is a departure from the normal practice of the government in so far as government appointments including quangos as a rule are limited to a period when the person concerned reaches years of age <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all who have participated in this debate this afternoon and particularly my colleagues who supported me <e> <s> i much welcome the balanced statement on behalf of the labour front bench by the noble lord lord beswick <e> <s> i am delighted that my argument was strengthened very forcibly by the contribution of the noble lord lord ezra drawing on his vast experience in this field <e> <s> if i may say so i am a great admirer of the noble earl lord gowrie <e> <s> he speaks with wit and wisdom but i must confess that on this particular occasion he has hardly dealt with the issues which were raised <e> <s> the issues raised were about the organisation and structure of the government with the nationalised industries and there is general agreement that all is not well in this field <e>", "<cs> my lords could the minister say exactly what is the contribution of the independent television companies to the fourth channel for this year <e> <s> most of the companies have already published that amount <e>", "<cs> my lords i am merely asking what is the total contribution of the independent television companies in financial terms to the maintenance of the fourth channel <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask a brief question <e> <s> is the set-up of this committee such that they are making the same mistake as did the serpell committee in so far as the management consultants concerned were members of the committee <e> <s> i have no objection to the use of management consultants i think they can be useful and appropriate but in so far as a member of this three-man committee is going to be one of the consultants it makes him a prisoner of their recommendations <e> <s> would it not be wiser if the three members of this committee were completely independent of the management consultants whose report has to be considered i hope objectively <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that when this matter was discussed in the house two years ago during the passage of the forestry bill the target for disposals was million and that this has now been arbitrarily doubled <e> <s> is he also aware that the uncertainty which arises from these proposals has caused a very substantial drop in the planting programme of both the forestry commission and the private sector <e> <s> in we planted hectares private and state <e> <s> last year the figure fell to hectares <e> <s> is such a policy sensible in the light of the import bill for timber and timber products which has now reached the staggering figure of billion per annum <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord keep in mind when updating future targets in this field the importance of maintaining the excellent partnership that has existed between the private sector and the state sector over the past years <e> <s> will he also keep in mind that mature and semi-mature woodlands that are revenue producing are being sold off while the forestry commission retains the responsibility at the taxpayers expense for research and management advice and that this creates an unbalance that is undesirable <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i thank the minister for his answer <e> <s> in view of the fact that he said that the minister takes account of the advice of the office of fair trading will he tell the house how often the minister has departed from the recommendations of the office of fair trading in the past five years <e> <s> secondly would he agree that the financial press in <e>", "<cs> my lords when the minister ultimately declares his policy will there be some attempt to establish some consistency in decisions <e> <s> foreign investors in particular who do not understand the idiosyncrasies of these references find it extremely difficult to operate in london where there is no body of consistent decision-making available to them <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give an assurance that in the disposal of forestry commission land with a substantial recreational facility these will be preserved in the plans for disposal <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate has gone on rather longer than expected but in view of the fact that when this matter was discussed in the other place there was very sharp criticism of the sdp-liberal alliance for failing to make its position clear and because this is a very important subject i propose to say a few words this afternoon <e> <s> we on these benches are agreed on the need to support the international financial institutions in maintaining stability in the international financial system <e> <s> questions which we may ask are is it enough <e> <s> is it in time <e> <s> the possibility of collapse of the international financial system is something that i do not look forward to and would not like to encourage <e>", "<cs> my lords the british government like those of other countries have representatives on the imf <e> <s> once the per cent <e> <s> increase is carried through the total british contribution to the imf quotas will be only per cent <e> <s> i think the total at the moment is per cent <e> <s> so do not let us overestimate our power and influence to make the imf decide in favour of our political prejudices or particular wishes <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there are now peers on the sdp liberal alliance benches and that this makes this house much more representative of the will of the people than the other place with the distorted electoral system <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches welcome the statement and thank the noble lord for it <e> <s> we recognise the substantial contribution which is made by city institutions to the economic welfare of the country particularly to the balance of payments and we support any measures which are aimed at improving the efficiency and enhancing the reputation of these institutions <e> <s> that certainly includes the stock exchange <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister advise the house on the timing of these issues to ensure that in the carrying out of such an ambitious programme the government will not overload the market with new issues in order to ensure that the taxpayer gets the maximum advantage in the presentation of these companies for privatisation <e>", "<cs> my lords this house is fortunate to be able to welcome the noble lord lord barnett and for me it is an honour to be the first speaker to congratulate him on a splendid maiden speech <e> <s> over the years i am sure all of us have admired his contributions in another place particularly in the field of financial strategy and fiscal policy <e> <s> he brings to this house an immense knowledge and experience as a treasury minister <e> <s> he confessed in his excellent book <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble lord the minister tell us whether the figure quoted of billion of capital expenditure in the public sector represents an increase on previous years in view of the requirements in the public sector for substantial capital expenditure to keep industry going <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his informative and reassuring reply to all woodland owners in this country either state or private <e> <s> has his attention been drawn to the article in saturdays <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that the secretary general of the united nations this morning foresaw this situation which is expressed this afternoon in this house and tried to take an initiative from his end to bring the parties together <e> <s> with the discontinuance of the disarmament talks at geneva we must surely maintain some form of communication <e> <s> may i say that the statement made today with its rejection of all soviet intentions and approaches introduces into this question a degree of finality which would be disastrous for all of us if it were to continue <e>", "<cs> my lords first i want to congratulate the noble lord lord carmichael on his quick promotion to the front bench and for his excellent maiden speech <e> <s> it is a particular pleasure for me to welcome him because of a long personal association both with him and his family <e> <s> the noble lord has spent literally all his life in politics <e> <s> he was brought up in the stimulating atmosphere of the independent labour party in glasgow an experience which i shared and enjoyed <e> <s> his father introduced me to the glasgow town council nearly half a century ago that great centre that great training ground for future members of parliament the glasgow city council and the noble lord lord carmichael followed his father to westminster having served his apprenticeship in glasgow <e> <s> he has had experience in government office and i am sure that that experience and background will enable him to make a notable contribution to the affairs of this house and we hope that he will exercise his talents in that direction <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord could get an up-to-date copy of the british rail timetable <e> <s> that shows that you do not have to wait an hour and a half at glasgow central in order to get a train <e> <s> they run every half-hour to edinburgh from queen street and also every second train from edinburgh to perth is a direct through train <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for that reply may i ask whether he is aware that the auditor and comptroller general quotes the scottish office valuation of these premises as million not the price at which the college was disposed of <e> <s> is he aware that in a similar instance a few years ago the disposal of robroyston hospital the premises were sold for and within two years the property speculator realised over million <e> <s> the scottish office laid down certain rules under the halliday report affecting the disposal of these assets <e> <s> why were these procedures not followed in the case of hamilton college <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the assurance of the minister that this matter will be deferred until the public accounts committee has discussed it in full <e> <s> may i simply ask how he can be sure that the market price was realised for this property when reputable estate agents were not employed in the sale and the property was not advertised in estate journals or property magazines of any kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to press this matter but will the minister confirm that while the property was advertised in the <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell us who will be attending that conference <e> <s> who is the minister responsible for consumer affairs and will consideration be given to upgrading the ministry for consumer affairs in the government so that in legislation which is now being proposed by the government we will ensure adequate consumer protection against private monopolies <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much look forward to this clear definition of what is modernisation and what is replacement of plant <e> <s> this will certainly be carefully examined by all industrialists who try to get some assistance from the new regional fund <e> <s> may i ask the minister whether it is the intention in calculating job creation to calculate simply the actual investment <e> <s> is he aware that some very large investments are in themselves very expensive in terms of support <e> <s> nevertheless they create jobs for three to five years in the construction industry by the building of these factories <e> <s> i have one in mind by hoffman la roche in ayrshire <e> <s> also local suppliers have benefited very considerably from this particular investment although it is not a direct result of the investment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord nugent of guildford for introducing this debate <e> <s> i hope that this precedent will be followed by debating the annual reports of other large institutions that affect our daily life <e> <s> in pursuit of our parliamentary duties we are compelled from time to time to read reports annual reports government reports and so on <e> <s> in anticipation of this debate i read the annual report which we are now discussing <e> <s> i found it easy to read most impressive and an excellent record of good work done in our name <e> <s> i would add my congratulations to the bbc for the contents of that report on the discharge of their immense public responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that fundamental to the success of this excellent organisation is the contribution of the united states since the united states has always been the major contributor <e> <s> would she stress to the united states government that expediture of aid in this direction is frequently more important than purely military intervention in combating communism in the third world <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that demands on local authority expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to welcome a new voice into your lordships house and as the noble lord lord obrien has said how good it is that we have young and experienced members of your lordships house to guide us in our considerations of complex matters such as the business before us this afternoon <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord brabazon of tara will not be detained by stock exchange duties to an extent which will not permit him to pursue these matters in the committee stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords in the privatisation measures which the government are now proposing are they taking into account the outstanding record of the nationalised industries in supporting british industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the minister for his statement <e> <s> in many senses the situation is a tragedy <e> <s> it seems that this christmas is associated with tragedy and this particular tragedy appears to be self-inflicted <e> <s> i live within a few miles of scott lithgows yard and can readily visualise the real depth of the tragedy in a district which already has per cent <e> <s> unemployment <e> <s> the number who will be thrown out of work on the loss of this particular contract will be about <e> <s> the viability of the whole yard will also be brought into question since it has on its books only the two remaining contracts mentioned by the minister <e> <s> that would probably mean that the number of people unemployed would be increased by as a result of the closure of scott lithgow <e> <s> ships have been built there at the tail of the bank since <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the reasons why the sdp/liberal alliance exists in this house and in the country is its non-doctrinaire approach to the <e>", "<cs> we on these benches will support the noble lord lord bruce of donington in his contention not that we subscribe to everything he said in proposing his amendment <e> <s> this bill is designed to permit the stock exchange to be exempt from the rules governing restrictive practices

to hear that while i propose to rehearse a little of the background of this bill i do not propose to make a second reading speech on this occasion <e> <s> your lordships will recall that this bill arises from the deliberations of the office of fair trading which over a period of six years examined the rule book of the stock exchange and concluded that there were cases of infringement of the law as it then stood <e>", "<cs> i should like to emphasise that we on these benches in introducing this amendment are anxious not to impede in any way the process of change in the stock exchange <e> <s> the provisions which the noble lord outlined on second reading are welcome so far as we are concerned and i realise that some of them have immediate implications as can be observed daily from the financial press <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the noble lord for that reply and for indicating that the target is million does his subsequent statement mean that this is not a limited target and that there is no certainty that having sold million-worth of forestry commission land this selling-off programme will cease <e> <s> will the noble lord read the recent statement of his noble friend lord belstead to the effect that he regards the success of forestry in this country as being essentially based upon a partnership <e> <s> will he tell us how a partnership can be run effectively when one partner is being diminished by decree of the government while the other partner is being enlarged <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in the forestry commission he has a very devoted work force who take great pride in the woodlands that they have created <e> <s> could i have a guarantee from him that before the figure of million is exceeded the work force will be taken into consultation in any further selling-up programme <e>", "<cs> my lords may i anticipate the report just a little and ask the minister whether the government are still committed to the principle of competition as a means of achieving efficiency in this as in other industries <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the amendment moved by my noble friend lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> in the second reading debate i said that the difficulty about this bill is that it seeks to impose a private enterprise pattern on a natural monopoly <e> <s> what emerges is a private monopoly and a private monopoly like a public monopoly creates certain anxieties and apprehension <e> <s> i know of no other measure on which i have been so professionally lobbied as i have been on this bill because of the proper anxieties of the parties who are affected by it <e>", "<cs> my lords we too on these benches should like to thank the noble lord for repeating the brief but hopeful statement regarding the outcome of the negotiations at port glasgow and greenock <e> <s> the house will be relieved by the prospect of the redundancies announced some time ago perhaps being offset a little by the possibility of trafalgar house taking over the yard and employing at least a large proportion of the people who a few weeks ago seemed to have no hope of further employment in the yard <e>", "<cs> having heard the statement of the minister which was a fair job description of the man sought for this important post having at the same time accepted the concern expressed by the noble lord lord mcintosh i hope that having been given the assurance of the kind of man the government have in mind the noble lord will consider not pressing this amendment to a division <e>", "<cs> i confess to having been a part-time member of the group which was set up on the initiative of the noble lord lord orr-ewing <e> <s> we are indebted to the noble lord and his group for their very detailed examination of the bill <e> <s> the results of that examination will no doubt emerge in subsequent amendments <e> <s> i find the noble lord lord cockfield in his most engaging and persuasive mood tonight <e> <s> he has persuaded me that this is an unfortunate amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord spens having expressed the view of the group i hope he will be induced to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the noble lord lord bruce of donington is not to press this amendment to a division <e> <s> it will avoid the embarrassment of the alliance failing to subscribe to a point of view that has been expressed from the opposition front bench <e> <s> i subscribe to a good deal of what was stated by the noble lord lord thorneycroft except that he limits the possibility of alternative government to one party a rather limited view i would naturally and respectfully suggest of future prospects in british politics <e>", "<cs> the noble lord may withdraw his amendment but he does not withdraw his remarks <e> <s> i was wondering how the noble lord would reconcile his general support in this bill for the creation of a public monopoly when he says that the incentives to inventiveness and enterprise cannot be contained within the structure of a monopoly system <e> <s> i am afraid the noble lord himself is rather far-removed from the market place and does not understand that there are other incentives to service in the community rather than purely the profit motive and that some people in the post office over the years have taken a pride in the creation of the institution which has served this nation well <e> <s> i am rather doubtful whether in the new circumstances in an organisation <e>", "<cs> may i too press the minister because he has indicated throughout that the man concerned and his staff will be civil service staff <e> <s> the salary range in the civil service is well established from permanent secretary downwards <e> <s> if they are to be regarded as civil service staff then obviously they will be contained within that salary range <e> <s> it is not a commercial department such as the coal board or the steel board where they pay the market rates in order to get the man concerned <e> <s> but if this new department is to be related to civil service grades then i am afraid that it will not be possible to attract the kind of man who can exercise the vast authority and powers which are vested in him in this description <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will respond to the anxieties that have been expressed from all parts of the committee <e> <s> if the amendment is perhaps either weak or defective in its drafting at least the sentiment expressed in this committee this afternoon is quite clear <e> <s> a fundamental difficulty of the bill is that we have lived within the tradition of a public service in the post office which on the whole has been found to be acceptable and we are now going to create a company which is to be floated on the market and which must attract shareholders on the basis of a prospectus which promises a certain return in profits <e> <s> that profit-earning aspect of the successor company is where the problem arises <e>", "<cs> i am surprised that the government should be resisting this amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord glenarthur said earlier that the success of the company would depend on the extent to which people use the service so that the whole purpose of a well-managed company will be to encourage people to make calls <e> <s> one of the reasons that perhaps prohibits people from making calls is that they do not have the number and want to use directory services <e> <s> surely directory services are an aid to sales which would normally generate traffic for the successor company <e> <s> consequently i am surprised that this is not accepted as a reasonable proposition <e>", "<cs> i hope that this amendment will not be pressed <e> <s> i had the experience the other day of requesting a telephone directory <e> <s> i live on the outskirts of the city of glasgow <e> <s> i am provided with a telephone directory for the city but i requested one for the surrounding area and was duly charged for the area directory <e> <s> so if you request another directory you are charged under the present system <e> <s> i am afraid that in our anxiety sometimes in the bill we are trying to lay down the practice for the board of the successor company in too direct and minute a manner <e> <s> i would imagine i have stated this previously that if the board is to maximise its revenues it must provide the facilities to the subscriber to make telephone calls as easily and cheaply as possible <e> <s> i regard the provision of a telephone directory as essential in the chain between the consumer and the provider of the service <e> <s> under these circumstances i would tend to leave it to the good sense of the commercial board to decide that a telephone directory is an essential element in selling its particular product <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to support the third reading of the bill <e> <s> while as the noble lord lord ross of marnock has said it does not fulfil all the wishes of all the ardent scots it has gone some way towards doing so <e> <s> when it was announced i remember that one sunday newspaper declared that scotland had declared udi on tourism <e> <s> the bill hardly goes that far but it is a step in the right direction <e>", "<cs> my lords while everyone welcomes the immediate ready response to this case of emergency would the minister accept that to achieve some degree of recovery in this situation requires a greater contribution than is mentioned in the immediate package <e> <s> will the noble baroness confirm <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that the figures he has just quoted are a reflection of the increased use of credit cards and of instalment credit generally and not a reflection of any basic economic recovery <e>", "<cs> this amendment is not purely semantics <e> <s> it is designed to strengthen the commitment <e> <s> your lordships will recall that during the discussion on the first amendment in this marathon debate we expressed anxieties on the part of consumers and others at the immense power that was being concentrated on the minister and the director and the diminished power of the post office users national council which at present is the watchdog of consumer interests <e>", "<cs> with due respect to the noble lord lord somers my name is also down to this amendment and i propose to divide the committee on this <e>", "<cs> i have a good deal of sympathy with the view expressed by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> as i said on second reading and i hope we do not go into second reading again on this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i cannot respond to the temptation offered to me by the noble lord <e> <s> i said on second reading that the economies of eastern europe are a demonstration of the weaknesses of state monopoly over the entire economy <e> <s> i do not believe that monopolies are good for economic growth <e> <s> however if we make that general principle and reach that general agreement we now have to apply it to this particular occasion and this particular instance <e>", "<cs> the amendment is totally inadequate for the purposes which the noble lord has in mind <e> <s> nevertheless the sentiment expressed should get some response from the government as to what enlightened personnel policies they have in mind in the new company <e> <s> the terms of the amendment almost suggest that there should be a cosseted relationship between the company and the employees <e> <s> but that is not what is sought <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord stoddart is seeking to maintain some of the traditions of good personnel policies that exist at present in the organisation <e>", "<cs> the amendment gives the minister the opportunity of saying once more what he anticipates will be the practice in this important area which affects employment substantially in the united kingdom and the welfare of some of our prestigious companies in this field <e> <s> i hope he will take that opportunity as it affects the whole purchasing policy of the new company if restrictions of imports of this kind are imposed <e> <s> the amendment says that the restrictions on imports are in relation to companies that do not exercise reciprocity <e> <s> that seems to me to be a reasonable proposition <e>", "<cs> the point raised by the noble lord lord thorneycroft does not anticipate the change in the general attitude within british telecom as a state owned organisation with some responsibility for the welfare of british industry in general and some responsibility as a nationalised business <e> <s> if you change that and create a private monopoly whose concern is to realise the profits envisaged in the prospectus then they have to give that precedence in their thinking <e> <s> sir george jefferson has said all right we will buy from british companies <e> <s> i welcome very much the assurance that he has given to the noble lord and i will be happy to see that in <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister recall that about a year ago the same <e>", "<cs> the committee will recall that the first amendment to this bill some days ago was one proposed by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran suggesting that an authority be set up to perform some of the functions outlined in the proposals before us today to set up a council <e> <s> that amendment was defeated by four votes <e> <s> it contained certain proposals that members of the committee may have found difficult to support <e> <s> one proposal was that the new authority would appoint the chairman of oftel <e> <s> it was a proposal about which i had some doubts myself <e> <s> in the amendment now proposed your lordships will see that there is a different relationship between the council suggested by the noble lord <e> <s> lord bruce of donington and the proposal of the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran that was so narrowly defeated <e> <s> in this case there would be a perfect liaison between the chairman of oftel and the new body since he would be the chairman of the council <e>", "<cs> i know that the noble and learned lord is a very persuasive minister and i am inclined to accept his argument <e> <s> considering the fact that already this afternoon the government have made substantial concessions in the bill i do not feel like pressing the amendment to a division though to be honest i am not fully persuaded of the logic of the ministers statement <e> <s> if the point applies to licences it is unlikely that there will be cases but this provision is necessary in contracts and is frequently used in commerce <e> <s> quite frankly i cannot see the undesirability of having that overall provision in the law just as a contingency <e> <s> as the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it is necessary to build this into the bill <e> <s> we are talking about the procedures to be carried out by a public limited company which will have a board of directors who will represent the interests of shareholders <e> <s> the point that is being made which relates to some subsequent amendments is that there is a great danger of this company exercising that monopoly purchasing power by supporting its own additional production capacity be it telephone instruments or whatever and because it has a monopoly power it will be able to concentrate on purchasing within its own business to the exclusion of other competitors <e>", "<cs> i am thankful for the description of the protection in the bill given by the noble and learned lord lord mackay of clashfern <e> <s> in view of all that he has said i would counsel my colleagues to withdraw this amendment <e> <s> i am delighted to have the assurances that have just been given <e>", "<cs> i should like to make some comments before the noble lord lord mottistone withdraws his amendment and i should imagine in the light of the statement made by the minister that withdrawal is inevitable because the minister has conceded the case for the amendment and has even been more generous than is provided for in the amendment <e> <s> i said on an earlier amendment that we on these benches would do nothing to impede or frustrate british telecom <e> <s> i must say that the fewer constraints that are put on this company the better for the efficient operation of the company <e> <s> but from the statement just made by the minister there are a whole series of constraints that he wishes to build around british telecom and they are very serious <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches should like to thank the noble lord for the statement made this afternoon and to congratulate the minister on achieving a further subsidy for this important service in a period when there is so much talk of government cut-backs in one way or another <e> <s> at the same time i should like to ask one or two questions <e> <s> i notice that the subsidy to macbrayne is million while that to p o is million <e> <s> both companies carry freight though macbrayne carry both passengers and freight <e> <s> i am wondering how the costings were calculated which provided the million subsidy to p o as against the million to macbrayne when one considers that macbrayne has a much more substantial service to the islands and carries a greater number of passengers and freight <e> <s> it would be interesting to know how those computations were made <e>", "<cs> my lords will the example of caledonian macbrayne of placing their orders in british yards be drawn to the attention of other companies which may enjoy a subsidy of this kind <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> a subsequent amendment in my name not only encourages the participation of users as consumers of the service it also encourages the users to become shareholders in the new company under preferential terms which would ensure a wide distribution of share ownership <e> <s> however the present amendment prefers simply that the advisory body should have consumer representation <e> <s> that seems to me to be logical and i hope that unless the point is to be covered in some of the proposals that will be brought forward in connection with the consultative <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord use his powers of persuasion with the insurance industry to ensure that premiums are reduced when burglar alarms are installed and thereby achieve the results that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has in mind <e>", "<cs> before the bill passes i should like to state that we on these benches are delighted to see the bill at this stage <e> <s> we regarded it in the early stages as a rather clumsy way of dealing with what called out for a new deal on mental health in scotland but here it is and we welcome the changes that have been included in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that the united nations target for aid is per cent <e> <s> of the gnp and would she tell the house how far short of that target we are now achieving <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the great public concern about this particular transaction can the minister indicate to the house when this minute might be produced and whether it will provide an opportunity for a discussion in this house or in another place on the facts which have been revealed by the public accounts committee <e> <s> can the minister confirm that in the public accounts committee it was established that the chief valuer put a value of million on these properties that they were subsequently sold for and that the chief solicitor has declared in the public accounts committee evidence that the properties were not adequately exposed for sale <e> <s> in view of these facts can the minister expedite the preparation of the governments comment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not had the privilege of the parliamentary experience gained by most noble lords who have spoken and perhaps i could have some guidance from the noble lord the minister on the subject of the treasury minute <e> <s> there are issues of public accountability and ministerial responsibility which go back a long time since crichel down <e> <s> i wonder whether the treasury minute is the appropriate vehicle for dealing with these two matters <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the new emphasis of the distribution of arts council funds to the regions is much welcomed in certain parts of the country and that his rescue operation for scottish opera is much appreciated north of the border <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is indebted to the noble lord lord beswick for introducing this important subject in the reasonable manner in which he has presented his case <e> <s> he has avoided a substantial reference to party policy in the matter and has invited us to stimulate our thoughts a little <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not skilled in these matters parliamentary at all <e> <s> perhaps the noble and learned lord could confirm that there were some amendments passed to this bill when it was before this house <e> <s> is this the final report from the other place on the total of the amendments passed <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the figure of new jobs created in direct and indirect employment from north sea oil is a welcome figure in scotland and particularly in areas of high unemployment <e> <s> could he tell us now what is <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is indebted to the noble lord lord carmichael for his criticism of the bill with his intimate and relatively recent experience as a glasgow city councillor <e> <s> we look forward also to the contribution of the former provost of aberdeen who is in his place today with his experience and knowledge in this field <e>", "<cs> my lords in the debate in another place the case of marks and spencer in glasgow was quoted <e> <s> they paid twice the rate per square foot for their premises in glasgow compared to oxford street in london <e> <s> will the provisions of the bill help to mitigate that kind of discrepancy <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the minister is a very reasonable man <e> <s> i hope that having heard arguments submitted from all parts of the house he will accede to the request contained within the amendment <e> <s> i have an abiding interest in this subject <e> <s> i entered glasgow corporation at the age of <e> <s> my first motion before that distinguished chamber was that the city of glasgow should petition the government to revise the local rating system <e> <s> a long time has passed since then <e> <s> there has been a continued accumulation of anomalies with the changing pattern and responsibilities of local government <e> <s> i sat for six years in the valuation appeals court in glasgow and spent many a dreary day listening to appeals submitted <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that substantial progress has been made while the company is largely under public ownership is there any good reason to disrupt that progress by changing ownership and going through a privatisation process <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the minister if he will confirm that a letter was sent from the prime ministers office to his department which stated <e>", "<cs> my lords would it be true to say that the decision to strike locally was carried on a narrow majority <e> <s> would it be true to say that there is an agreed procedure for settling local disputes and that therefore there can be no justification for calling a national strike <e> <s> would it be true to say that the non-registered ports are continuing to operate and can the minister give us some idea of how much traffic is handled by the non-registered ports <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for his reply and agree with him that in the disposals to private enterprise there have been some successes <e> <s> it is easy to be wise after the event but would the noble earl agree with me that the timing and pricing of a number of these issues has caused public concern and even embarrassment to her majestys government particularly the recent case of enterprise oil which could affect the forthcoming issue of british telecom <e> <s> in the light of these facts would he now state what is the net amount which the government expect to raise from the telecom issue and how this differs from the original estimate <e>", "<cs> my lords while the minister stated that the enterprise oil issue caused no embarrassment would he agree that the <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches should like to thank the noble lord for his informative statement this afternoon <e> <s> before we welcome the statement we should be happy to have assurance on a number of points <e> <s> the first of these <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will forgive me if i try to reduce the temperature of this debate <e> <s> it is not that i am without sympathy for some of the observations which have been made by the noble lord lord marsh and by my noble friend lord harris of greenwich but i am afraid that this important debate on the broad spectrum of the economy of this country will be somewhat over-shadowed by the issues which have been raised by those two noble lords <e> <s> that would be a pity but inevitably the headlines will be directed towards the matters they have raised to the exclusion of some of the major issues which we have to discuss this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a certain amount of sympathy with this amendment largely because i am a great supporter of the idea of the co-operative development agency which is promoted in the bill <e> <s> indeed one of the misfortunes of the co-operative organisations of this country is that they have become affiliated to one political party when the co-operative idea is a much broader idea and cannot be contained within the limits of one political organisation <e> <s> so the alliance has and i hope others on the conservative benches will have a certain amount of sympathy with the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord graham of edmonton <e>", "<cs> my lords i was referring to the fact that the co-ops in the united kingdom unlike the co-ops in any other part of the world have a direct political affiliation which inhibits the general appeal which i hope will be reflected in support for the bill in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us how far short we are of the per cent <e> <s> target of the united nations for overseas aid <e> <s> if we were to reach that target would it not go some way to assist the problem of lease-lending transport helping our own industries in this country and relieving the pressure in ethiopia <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to a question yesterday the minister expressed his deep and genuine concern about conditions in ethiopia at the moment <e> <s> would he accept that it would be a practical expression of that concern if a more determined effort was made to increase the aid funds from the united kingdom government and to attain the target of per cent <e> <s> of gdp <e> <s> is he further aware that at the end of the war when this country was devastated we committed per cent <e> <s> of our gdp to overseas assistance to less fortunate countries and would he suggest that moral standards have declined since those days <e>", "<cs> my lords before the bill passes may i say that i have had a lifelong association with the co-operative movement and the co-operative idea and i wonder whether i may say a word of welcome and congratulation to the government on the passing of this bill <e> <s> the government are frequently charged with obsessive belief in the virtues of private enterprise <e> <s> in passing this bill and guaranteeing the continued existence of the co-operative development agency they have recognised the relevance of the co-operative idea in the mixed economy of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords tribute has already been paid by other speakers to the reasoned way in which this report has been introduced by the noble lord lord obrien of lothbury <e> <s> i should like to add my tribute to his conduct as chairman of this committee <e> <s> this is the second report with which i have been privileged to be associated under his chairmanship <e> <s> while we spend long hours listening to witnesses and reading evidence in the room upstairs one must occasionally ask oneself whether it is worthwhile <e> <s> i hope the speeches that have been made this afternoon will continue the process begun by an earlier report a complicated report on membership of the european monetary fund which seemed to revive a general interest in that matter <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord obrien and his colleagues will feel encouraged to use their talents their probing their objectivity in the interests of this house and the production of reports similar to the one that is before us this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords those who were at the meetings which took place so recently and which ministers attended must have been aware to some extent of the dreadful situation in ethiopia <e> <s> i am wondering whether that situation featured at all on the agenda and if not whether any initiatives are likely to be taken by the minister through his connections with the european community over the distribution of surpluses in order to assist ethiopia <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming the statement made by the minister with regard to the assistance given by the united kingdom government to ethiopia could he answer the question as to whether her majestys government propose to take initiatives through the community in order to encourage the community to respond to this situation by the distribution of some of their vast surpluses <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that the number of unemployed is unevenly distributed throughout the regions of the united kingdom <e> <s> in view of the noble lords concern for helping in this situation will he explain the fact that regional employment grants have been cut by one third in the last year and by no less than per cent <e> <s> for scotland <e> <s> in the circumstances is that likely to contribute to a reduction in the uneven balance of unemployment in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the house this afternoon has heard at least two remarkable speeches one from the noble earl lord stockton and i add my tribute to all the others that have been heaped upon him <e> <s> but your lordships have just heard another outstanding and remarkable speech <e> <s> it is not often that we look to the bishops benches if i may say so with due respect to hear the authentic voice of the coal miners of nottingham yet i feel that there was a great deal of truth in what the right reverend prelate said <e> <s> is it not a pity that his voice of quiet reason great wisdom and christian sensitivity should not have been expressed at an earlier stage in this confrontation between the miners and the coal board <e> <s> i almost feel that after hearing the right reverend prelate the bishop of southwell anything that i have to say is an intrusion <e> <s> a few moments silence to digest his wisdom and his guidance might have been useful at this stage <e> <s> but i return to the economic debate and the gracious speech which is the matter before us <e> <s> i agree that the contribution of the right reverend prelate is relevant to the gracious speech and to the economic situation <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches very much support the statement that has just been made <e> <s> perhaps i cannot contribute with the same eloquence as the noble lord who has just resumed his seat but coming as i do from one of the regions i cannot help but feel that we are rather discriminated against in the statement which has just been repeated <e> <s> last year the total assistance in regional aid under the industrial development act was cut by this government by one third <e> <s> for scotland in fact it was cut by per cent <e> <s> last year <e> <s> on top of that now we have an additional regional policy statement in which a further million is to be saved in regional aid <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to detain the house but with due respect i think that one of the major questions which i tried to ask was not really answered <e> <s> i am referring to the question of reducing the incentives to inward investment <e> <s> if we cut the capital allowances from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> we must remember that we are in a highly competitive world as regards attracting inward investment from the united states from japan and elsewhere which has been a resounding success in scotland <e> <s> i do not subscribe to the view that regional policy has totally failed <e> <s> there are many indications that regional policy has been effective in transforming the scottish economy but it is in the face of great competition from many other parts of the world that are seeking to attract new high technology industries <e> <s> bearing in mind that competition if we cut the capital allowance from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> it is likely that many of the firms that make up what is now called silicon glen in scotland will depart and invest elsewhere <e> <s> i cannot see that that contributes in any way to improving the economy of the nation or creating new jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord in considering this matter weigh the question of public convenience alongside the security interest <e> <s> is he aware that the local community welcomes the raf personnel in the area and enjoys their presence rather than have them segregated from the community in any ghetto-like fashion <e> <s> will he keep the community interest in mind and also public access and public convenience <e>", "<cs> my lords since the question makes some reference to the valuation of assets and since the valuation of assets will i hope have some relevance to the price at which the royal ordnance factories will be disposed of can the minister tell us whether it would not be wise to await the examination of the public accounts

statement that has just been made <e> <s> the noble lord lord carmichael has made reference to his university constituency <e> <s> the university constituency concerned is now represented by a

related in any sense to performance <e> <s> may i ask what is the total cost of mr macgregors services the transfer fee of million i assume plus annual salary <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he is aware that two officials of the religious society of friends quakers will appear in the courts next week being responsible as employers for the staff of friends house who have withheld tax as suggested in the question asked <e> <s> may i ask the minister whether he will read the evidence which will be presented in the court to see how far the admirable provisions in our constitution for conscientious objection may be taken into account in the framing of our tax laws in the future <e> <s> i emphasise that i am making no comment on the action that is being taken but i would ask the minister to look at this particular case <e>", "<cs> my lords while we on these benches take a fairly pragmatic view of the question of privatisation and sales of government assets we try to view these matters in the light of good housekeeping on the part of the taxpayer i must say that on these <e>", "<cs> my lords we now return to the subject of the insolvency bill <e> <s> i apologise to the house for being on my feet longer than i ought to be in one day <e> <s> perhaps this may even be just the forerunner to the amount of time we shall devote to this bill at the committee stage because this is a complex bill <e> <s> i know of no bill since the british telecom bill on which i have had more professional advice lobbying and representation <e> <s> i am indebted to the various professional organisations which have been good enough to give me their views <e>", "<cs> my lords the conventions of the house provide that on these occasions we cannot or do not vote against the order <e> <s> however the terms of the order are such that i am sorely tempted to defy the conventions but i will not do so <e> <s> as the minister said we have been over this ground before and the statement which was made tonight is consistent with the original statement and the justification <e> <s> to that extent we are not going to vote against the order but we are permitted

say from these benches that we welcome the assurances contained in this document and i am quite sure that the city will welcome it <e> <s> i do not adopt a snide or sneering attitude to the city

regulations to make it an effective and credible international financial centre we shall suffer as a country <e>", "<cs> time is moving on and i wonder whether the minister will be a little forthcoming about his attitude to the matters that have been raised <e> <s> he indicated at the outset that he was prepared to be less rigid than is normally the case <e> <s> the case against the clause has been well and truly stated <e> <s> quite apart from what has been said in the debate in this committee he must i am sure take cognisance of the considerable representations that have been made by bodies such as the cbi the institute of chartered accountants the law society and so on <e> <s> with all that weight of opinion which is critical of clause perhaps he could indicate to the committee that in the light of this afternoons discussion he is prepared to look at the matter again and thereby avoid the necessity of voting <e> <s> we all share the concern of the noble lord to do something about the situation <e> <s> if he were to act accordingly i think that it would be with the consensus and support of the committee <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the suggestion from these benches <e> <s> obviously the carrying of the amendment has a whole lot of repercussions on the bill not only in relation to cost but in relation to other aspects of the bill and it would be wise for the committee to think over the full implications regarding the bill and to adjourn now <e> <s> i support the suggestion <e>", "<cs> my lords since a fundamental feature of this bill has been defeated will there be provision on the recommitment that the governments alternative to the amendment which has been carried will be available for further amendment by this house <e> <s> will he in turn extend the timetable for consideration of this house in view of the fact that we are now about to reconsider fundamental features of that bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> in earlier discussions on this bill this chamber has been very sensitive to the <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that i have not had any response from the minister in this regard and as i feel that this is a matter of very important principle i propose to divide the committee <e>", "<cs> i think the answer to the noble lord who has just spoken who asked where the supervisory power arises is that it is in

importance on which the law society of scotland feels very strongly <e> <s> it is opposed to the proposal contained in this clause and also to clause that there should <e>", "<cs> with the assurance given that the government are now prepared to look at the role of the supervisory committee and clearly define it i shall certainly be glad to withdraw the amendment at this stage <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble and learned lord for his understanding of this position <e> <s> i accordingly withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as has been said already this evening we have been round the course before <e> <s> i want to say only that we shall ultimately withdraw our amendment but that we have had some advice this evening not only from consumer organisations <e> <s> if the noble lord has a deep concern for the interests of consumers he will appreciate that the amendment before the committee is drafted by the national <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that many of those engaged in this peaceful protest are members of the religious society of friends who have a long record of peaceful protest spread over years <e> <s> to suggest that these individuals were involved in increased local crime is hardly justified and is not likely to ensure an acceptance of the governments case <e>", "<cs> my lords i too must apologise to the house for having to leave before the conclusion of the debate <e> <s> i will consequently be very brief <e> <s> i endorse most of the things that have been said <e> <s> it must be a source of encouragement to the minister to feel that there is not only so much interest in this matter but also so much concern about it and so much experience in this field <e> <s> i think it is one of the delightful things about the former secretary of state for scotland with his long experience of scotland that on his retiral from that important political post he devoted his time to the national trust for scotland as vice-chairman <e> <s> his experience in that capacity can certainly be helpful to us in looking at this important matter <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether it is the case that the disposal of british shipbuilders is now open to competitive bids <e> <s> will the minister accept that it is common commercial practice when assets are exposed for competitive tender for a reserve price to be placed on the assets <e> <s> in this case will the minister observe the same commercial practice on the disposal of this national asset <e>", "<cs> during an earlier stage the noble lord lord grimond and i said that we had an open mind on this subject <e> <s> however i must say that despite the persuasive speeches of the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove and the noble baroness lady elliot i am not convinced that there

scotland that these places should be free and these traditions die hard <e> <s> but we are seeing changing times changing experience and changing standards and the mere fact that people are prepared

buildings to enable the secretary of state to accept the endowment of gardens or other lands acquired under section of the act as proposed in the extended paragraph of the new schedule <e> <s> this is rather an important matter in terms of the national trust for scotland and i would wish to press it <e>", "<cs> i hope the government will not be difficult about this <e> <s> as the noble earl lord perth said no one can do other than respect the deep concern of the national trust for scotland in these matters and they certainly feel that if powers similar to those proposed in the amendment can be conferred on the historic buildings and monuments commission for england there appears to be some justification for similar powers being made available to the secretary of state for scotland to acquire buildings in conservation areas which are of special architectural or historic interest and also gardens and <e>", "<cs> with that assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> at this late hour i hate to strike a discordant note but the statement just made by the minister is totally unacceptable <e> <s> it suggested that the government will reconsider this matter in two years time and if they feel that powers are necessary presumably they will introduce an amendment or some powers or a statutory order or new legislation <e>", "<cs> i ask the noble earl to observe the fact that provision is made in english law for what we are suggesting <e> <s> this was not provided in english law because of some idiosyncracies of english attitude or temperament <e> <s> it was provided because it was felt necessary <e> <s> i cannot for the life of me understand why a similar provision even if it is not used extensively should not be in this bill <e> <s> this is the moment to insert it when we are changing the law in relation to this matter and i cannot find any logic for resisting the provision of similar legislation for scotland as exists in england <e> <s> i find it difficult to accept the proposition of the minister on this matter <e>", "<cs> in view of the assurance by the noble earl that he will have a further look at this matter i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as we are near the end of this debate i will be brief <e> <s> i should like first to thank the noble earl lord gowrie for his usual clarity in introducing this bill <e> <s> he has been somewhat less controversial than in some of his more recent contributions to debates in this house although he has upset the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the achievements he has just related are substantially due to the support for british exporters from the export credits guarantee department <e> <s> has the noble lord seen the recent report of the all-party committee which underlines the importance of maintaining these services <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister made any calculation of the effect of an advertising tax on the receipts of the treasury from the levies on the independent television companies <e> <s> is that not already a substantial tax on advertising <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express my appreciation of the consideration which has been given to this matter by the minister <e> <s> i am sure that the amendment which he now moves will be well received in scotland <e> <s> i put down the amendment with some prompting from the national trust for scotland and i am glad that my persuasion plus the considerable weight given to the national trust for scotland has persuaded the minister to accept this amendent <e> <s> i have written to the minister but i should like formally to thank him <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the logic behind the statement made by the minister this afternoon <e> <s> it is obvious that if you guarantee a certain uptake to the oil companies at a certain fixed price as part of the participation agreement and the market weakens against you the taxpayer is bound to incur substantial losses <e> <s> indeed the select committee in the house of commons reviewing this matter only last week reported that current losses for bnoc amounted to million last year and that a continued weekly deficit has continued to operate <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i have misunderstood the minister and perhaps he could clarify this <e> <s> i assume it is correct that tax revenues will not be affected and that the overall rate of tax will not be affected by these decisions <e> <s> but if the off take price of oil is reduced by the major oil companies thereby reducing their revenues then presumably the taxation revenues will be consequently reduced <e> <s> i am asking what is the net effect of these measures on our total revenues <e> <s> i presume we shall save million on the abolition of bnoc that is the figure for last year but what will be the consequence of this on the taxation revenues which result from a reduction in the offtake price which is inevitable <e> <s> what is the net advantage to the nation <e>", "<cs> we are not a professional chamber <e> <s> it is difficult to arrange transport and hotels as well as there being other difficulties if the business of your lordships house is switched from tuesday afternoon for which you have made arrangements to a thursday afternoon when most people who live in scotland hope to get home some time that day <e> <s> that is all <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord the chief whip for that statement but i must say that in trying to encourage interest in this matter among scottish peers i have found some difficulty <e> <s> i hope that what i have said will be noted and that it will not prejudice the consideration of this important question at this stage <e>", "<cs> i welcome this opportunity of clearing up some of the points as regards the intentions of the amendment <e> <s> if you exclude the tsb scotland it does not mean that the tsb scotland which would then exist would be in the same relationship to the treasury as in the existing tsb structure <e> <s> that would be so for a limited period until you have a revised constitution and structure incorporated in a bill governing the tsb scotland with answerability to the bank of england and with all the freedom from constraints that presently exist over tsb operations <e> <s> we are not saying that the tsb scotland should just stay as it is at the moment and in the same relationship as the tsb uk <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to delay your lordships but may i ask the minister to confirm that if he believes that the tsb scotland will exercise independence he can explain the constitutional relationship between the holding board and the board of the tsb scotland <e> <s> in a scottish bank the board is elected by the shareholders <e> <s> in this case the board of that bank will be appointed by the central board in london <e> <s> is that so <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may ask the committee to forbear a little <e> <s> some of us have a long way to travel home journeying on a thursday night to scotland <e> <s> we have had two statements today and we are having a fairly long debate on the second amendment of this bill <e> <s> i was wondering whether i may be permitted since it is my amendment to say a word or two about it before the vote which might follow <e> <s> i do not want to pre-empt the noble lord lord houghton <e> <s> if he will permit <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord very much <e> <s> this has been a wide-ranging debate <e> <s> it has been a deeply philosophical debate on ownership and the nature of share ownership bank discounts and flotation <e> <s> it is not my intention to pursue some of the technicalities and intricacies of a flotation of this kind <e> <s> it is a very big flotation <e> <s> it may even be a flotation amounting to a billion pounds and therefore will make its appropriate impact on the market <e>", "<cs> my lords the statement refers to england and wales <e> <s> i am aware that the provision of education in scotland is jealously guarded by the secretary of state for scotland but since this is a very comprehensive review of educational practice is it intended that a similar or parallel statement will be made in relation to changes in the scottish education system <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches welcome the opportunity to say that we believe the railways have an important role to play in a well-ordered society <e> <s> it is a coincidence that we are debating this important matter just as the death of lord beeching has been announced <e> <s> despite all the derogatory comments that have been made concerning his plans i believe that lord beeching made a serious contribution to providing a railway system which was reasonable and efficient and which above all could be afforded <e>", "<cs> my lords since the paper referred to concerns two important matters in addition to the consumer interest which was referred to earlier the question of new procedures for board appointments and also the capitalisation of reserves which will have important consequences on the reports of the nationalised industries will the minister assure us that before any steps are taken in these directions legislation will be necessary to accomplish these objectives <e>", "<cs> my lords may i press the minister for an assurance as to whether legislation will be required in order to implement the proposals in the paper to which reference has been made <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the minister agree that in addition to the factors mentioned by the noble lord lord orr-ewing the question of financial arrangements in support of these bids is also important <e> <s> i congratulate the government and the banks concerned on the financial packages they put together recently in the placing of some of this business <e> <s> i should like also to ask the minister whether the financial arrangements are in all cases competitive with those of our major competitors in this field <e>", "<cs> my lords having listened to the noble and learned lord lord denning with his usual concise logic i think that i will withdraw this amendment and perhaps return to the subject on a clause which would provide for keeping prepayments in separate accounts so that this may be excluded as a category from trade creditors rather than introducing it into this clause which deals with disqualification <e> <s> accordingly i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords for the second time this afternoon we on these benches should like to congratulate the government on their statement <e> <s> we <e>", "<cs> my lords i must just say one word <e>", "<cs> my lords since i was referred to a moment ago and i am not continuing a political discussion i point out that my reference to a unilateral decision was in relation to the french <e> <s> it was a unilateral decision of her majestys government <e> <s> that is all i said <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord note that scottish supporters recently went to spain where the country was unfortunately defeated and the spanish police authorities complimented the scottish supporters upon their excellent behaviour <e> <s> in view of those circumstances is it right and just that the hooliganism which has been evident south of the border should be transferred to glasgow on the advice of the government that that fixture between scotland and england should be transferred <e> <s> will the noble lord answer the question put by the noble lord lord ross as to whether in view of the fact that many supporters have paid deposits on hotels to travel companies and for transport to attend the fixture they will be reimbursed by the government as they have now requested the transfer of that fixture north of the border <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ross of marnock has been so compelling in his arguments particularly in relation to the drafting difficulty mentioned by the minister that i do not <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a pleasure to follow the noble lord lord brucegardyne <e> <s> i want to take up only two points which he made briefly in this lengthy debate <e> <s> one is the element of consumer choice which obviously concerns the noble lord deeply <e> <s> i accept what he has said that even with the provisions of the watchdog for british telecom we have not yet guaranteed a situation which protects the public against the abuse of monopoly <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point but i was about to make my point by mentioning one of the interesting companies mentioned in the press today british leyland <e> <s> how glad we are to see that its corporate plan has at last been approved although it has been in the government machine since last november <e> <s> let us look at the background to that great industry <e> <s> while under private ownership it should have been restructuring and should have been investing substantially in new plant and equipment to be competitive with germany and japan but it continued to pay our dividends until it was practically <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that british telecom and others obviously including british gas will require to be floated internationally but the substantial impact will be on the united kingdom market <e> <s> lord diamond mentioned something like per cent <e> <s> the overall outlook for the equity market in this context does not appear so rosy as it might with the prospect of having to find as much as million by even assuming that only part of british gas is floated <e> <s> that is a serious matter which has to be thought about because i hope private industry will make some demands on the market in <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for delaying your lordships at this late hour on this matter <e> <s> i can only make the plea that i have not spoken so far in the lengthy deliberations on the abolition of the glc <e> <s> i am not knowledgeable of all the intricacies of that organisation <e> <s> however i am deeply concerned about this particular issue <e> <s> i should hope that we can divorce it from the general debate as to whether or not it is a good thing to abolish the glc <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for that somewhat reassuring reply <e> <s> perhaps i may ask her whether import duties and duties at the port are not the same thing <e> <s> they are a levy on aid which is provided <e> <s> will the noble baroness confirm that as stated in the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i welcome the representations that have been made by her majestys government and other aid donors in this field not that these should be directed towards reducing the amount of aid but so that this disincentive to giving aid will be removed and people will feel that the full benefit of their donation is being fully realised in aid for suffering <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches would also like to thank the noble earl for repeating the statement and for his very frank confession of the weaknesses and problems which arose in this particular case <e> <s> i do not intend on a banking matter to make a party political point but i believe that this is the first occasion on which this conservative government have nationalised an industry <e> <s> the net result of this exercise is that the government through the bank of england have acquired johnson matthey although it is implied in the statement that the bank will be returned to the private sector at the appropriate time <e> <s> it is an interesting comment on the debate we had in this chamber not so long ago when the virtues of robust private enterprise were lauded and the inadequacies of state enterprise were exposed <e>", "<cs> i too should like to join in the chorus of appeals to the government to have second thoughts on this matter <e> <s> whether or not the government like it the figure of million is the figure quoted and accepted as being the figure of relief to be granted to rectify some of the very serious problems that have arisen <e>", "<cs> my lords since i have taken a lively interest in this legislation indeed i think the amendment which i moved frustrated its smooth progress at report stage it might be appropriate if i were to say a word as the bill passes from this house today particularly since the agreement which i and others have negotiated with the tsb has been described by the scottish nationalists as a spineless surrender <e> <s> so i think it is appropriate that i should say a word in defence of our position <e>", "<cs> with respect my lords i was in this country and i invited the noble lord lord ross of marnock to join in negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for that reassuring reply to the question and for his acceptance of the fact that of the companies reviewed less than one-quarter had submitted the required information <e> <s> does the minister recall that this requirement was inserted in the act by an amendment in the name of the noble lord lord rochester from the alliance benches and does he agree that in addition to being a statutory requirement the obligation to involve employees in the business represents good management <e> <s> will he take the necessary steps through nedo the cbi and also the tuc to ensure that this act is being observed <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister also for honouring the assurance on the subject of criminal proceedings that he gave to me in the original statement of th june <e> <s> the noble earl will recall that the steps which were outlined in the statement of th june were designed to restore the confidence and the status of the city of london <e> <s> i think that the statement this afternoon which gives some assurance that the city is not above the law will be welcomed in the city and by the general public <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not wish to enter into the discussion on the proceedings before the court of session <e> <s> it would be a very interesting and somewhat extraordinary constitutional position if the court of session in due course was to rule that parliament was acting illegally <e> <s> that is a very interesting constitutional point <e> <s> i await the judgment with interest <e> <s> if of course the matter is taken to the european court of human rights we can expect a delay in the bill of at least four or five years <e> <s> that is the kind of time that is taken to deal with these matters before the european courts <e> <s> i make no comment on that position <e> <s> all that i would say to your lordships i am not blaming anyone is that the matter is a major plank in the activities of the declining fortunes of the scottish nationalists <e> <s> i think that it is largely a political stunt initiated by them and supported by them in order to keep alive their political credibility in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ross of marnock is quite right <e> <s> the board will not be elected <e> <s> the scottish tsb will be a separate registered bank and like any other plc the board will be appointed by the directors but will be subject to the approval of the shareholders <e> <s> it is company law <e> <s> it does not require to be incorporated in the bill as i understand it but i may be corrected <e> <s> it will be like any other public limited company it will be a bank like any other bank <e> <s> i see that the noble lord lord polwarth is in the chamber <e> <s> it will be like the bank of scotland clydesdale or whatever and it will have exactly the same status <e>", "<cs> my lords that question has been asked on a number of more public occasions than this including radio and television debates involving leading scottish nationalists <e> <s> i would not care to <e>", "<cs> my lords i was referring to the continuing legal process as being a political stunt <e> <s> that is what has been taken over as a political stunt in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that these satisfactory results are a result of investment decisions made in the last two or three years by major companies <e> <s> has his attention been drawn to the statement of the chief executive of the scottish development agency to the effect that the reduction in regional grants which is now operating places us at a disadvantage in attracting inward investment at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords since the anomalies in the rating system are much more apparent in scotland and this will be confirmed by the ministers right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland would the minister care to comment on the prospect of separate legislation for scotland which could avoid some of these anomalies rather than await a united kingdom solution <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> may i quote to him the report of oftel in connection with this matter <e> <s> they say <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that every country except the united states supports its domestic telecommunications industry substantially and there is no reciprocity on exports provided by any other country <e> <s> to that extent britain is opening up the market to foreign competition despite the investment of million by the post office gec and plessey in the development of this british system which is now being departed from <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister clarify whether we are discussing the minister setting the framework for these commercial transactions or whether we are talking about the minister approving individual commercial transactions <e> <s> that seems to me to be the point at issue <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister accept that the mercury contribution in this matter could be only per cent <e> <s> and that it does not make any serious impact on the monopoly power of british telecom in the market place <e> <s> does the noble lord accept also that the proposed increase structure bears heavily on local subscribers and on small businesses which use a short service facility as against the long-distance calls where they will suffer some competition from mercury <e> <s> is there a danger that the local subscriber will be subsidising the long-distance business calls against mercury in the future <e> <s> may i ask <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the decision of british telecommunications in this case has caused redundancies in areas of high unemployment in the telecommunications industry in this country <e> <s> is he also aware that according to the oftel report the placing of this order in sweden will mean that new research and development in this field will be conducted in sweden and not in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords may i invite the noble lord to expand on the reply that he gave to the noble lord lord diamond on the question of selective sanctions <e> <s> is he aware that there are substantial credits due for renewal in the next six months and will the application of selective sanctions involve the cessation of further credits to the south african banks who are now in the market for these renewals <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble and learned lord agree that since the good name of the city of london is involved in these matters it is of some importance in view of the pending deregulation of the financial institutions that this matter be clarified as early as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the government on accepting this very wise amendment and also to pay tribute to the noble lord lord ross of marnock for keeping an eye on the intricacies of this miscellaneous bill and helping us to arrive at sensible decisions <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the new price structure will benefit business where there is a per cent <e>

have increased by per cent <e> <s> where there is a complete monopoly <e> <s> is this not an abuse of monopoly power <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow the noble lord in trying to be as helpful as possible and to say that we on these benches have no desire to diminish the total sum realised in the ultimate flotation under whatever auspices it is <e>", "<cs> my lords we have been fortunate today to hear three distinguished maiden speeches <e> <s> i must confess in my congratulations to the noble lord lord kimball that i suspected he would dwell on matters of the countryside rather than on matters of the city <e> <s> i hope he will be tempted to leave the cloisters of lloyds or the wide open spaces of leicestershire to come down occasionally and give us the benefit of his wisdom in both fields <e> <s> in the case of the noble lord lord elliott again an old hand in a parliamentary sense how much we welcomed his references to the danger of two nations in our society <e>", "<cs> my lords i know it is customary at the close of these debates simply to say a few kind words in withdrawal but i observe that we have a little time in hand and perhaps i may be excused from following the normal procedure in order to corrrect one or two points <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we welcome the statement that has just been made and thank the minister for repeating it in this house <e> <s> we particularly welcome the opening statement in the foreword of the white paper which says <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us whether the advice of the noble lord

his statement this afternoon and to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord lord hatch of lusby but i understood that there was a certain discipline about timekeeping in a short debate and that those of us who were proposing to speak in this debate were allocated minutes <e> <s> the noble lord has spoken for minutes <e> <s> this may affect subsequent speakers <e> <s> i do not know who is responsible in this house for these matters but i raise this as a point of order <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne for his kindly references to the distinguished merchant bank with which i am associated <e> <s> may i assure him and the house that i am not speaking on behalf of that bank which is heavily engaged in a number of merger activities at the moment <e> <s> neither do i propose to explain or justify the fees that have been quoted <e> <s> this can be done very well but perhaps not in this forum <e>", "<cs> my lords can we take it that in order to secure maximum economy there will be complete collaboration with the independent broadcasting organisations with a view to their sharing the satellite facility <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl confirm the reference in the question that it is the governments declared policy to promote a free internal market in the ec <e> <s> in view of the decline in the value of sterling in relation to other european currencies does he accept that now might be the moment to look at our membership of the exchange rate mechanism <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister confirm that the same considerations as he has outlined in relation to the exploitation of north sea oil apply in the case of the norwegian fields <e> <s> is it true that the norwegians have decided to cut back on the exploitation of this finite resource <e>", "<cs> my lords accepting the point made by the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls concerning an early decision in this matter does the minister not accept that general motors has been involved in negotiations for nine months <e> <s> a deadline has been set for british and other interests to indicate their interests by th march <e> <s> will the minister assure the house that there will be adequate time thereafter to assess and evaluate the bids that may be forthcoming from other interests <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether the new date that is fixed i am going back to the original date will in any way inhibit the prospects of a management/employee buy-out consortium keeping in mind that arranging these kind of bids where you are covering a very wide range of interests and have to secure bank support for such a bid takes a little time <e> <s> could i have the assurance of the minister that the new date will enable the management/employee buy-out consortium to participate <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord look at this proposition <e> <s> the exercising of the golden share which is applicable in other companies that have been privatised retains power in the hands of the government by the possession of one share to control the future destiny of this company <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much appreciate the content and the temper of the statement that has been made <e> <s> we are in a struggle to detach people from traditional loyalties which is extremely difficult <e> <s> ministerial

consequences for the regime in that country any relevance in this situation in so far as any indication is being given to the people of northern ireland that they are endangering the continued subsidy

businesses which have now been privatised recognise no similar commitment <e> <s> does that cause him concern <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister acknowledge the fact that the visit of mr leutwiler representing the creditor bankers of south africa and the time limit that he has placed on rescheduling of south african debts plus the decision of barclays bank to cease further investment in the area is an important pressure in this direction <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his helpful comment and the indication that there is no change in the governments policy <e> <s> let me add that that will give some assurance to all parties in the forestry industry who were alarmed at recent reports that it was the intention of the ministry of agriculture to privatise all of the forestry commissions estates <e> <s> will the noble lord assure me that the government recognise the importance

right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland our congratulations on his ability to head off this unfortunate scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the statement that the policy is the policy outlined in november but in reply to the question the minister somewhat ominously remarked that disposals policy will always be reviewed <e> <s> can i have some assurance from the minister that

be pursued without the permission of parliament <e> <s> i know you have the power to do so but it would be a major change of policy and can i have some assurance in that regard <e>", "<cs> my lords

a doctrinaire matter this is not a matter in which parties are lining up one against one another <e> <s> this is a question of developing a housing policy with very serious social implications <e>",

will arise <e> <s> is this true or will this also be taken care of when the minister looks at the dates for exemption prior to the report stage <e>", "<cs> the date is important and the noble lord lord ross of marnock has made that point <e> <s> but even more fundamental is the matter raised by the noble earl lord perth <e> <s> it is the fact that the legislation affecting scotland will be different from the legislation in england <e> <s> that is a rather fundamental point which might also be tested <e>", "<cs> the examples which have just been quoted by my noble friend lord harris related to the parole board and the metropolitan police <e> <s> with due respect they are not trading organisations in the way that the gas board will be a trading organisation and i think we might strengthen our argument from these benches if we quoted the experience of trading organisations such as the british railways board and other boards in the nationalised sector where it is not uncommon

experience in nationalised industries in no sense did that in any way diminish the responsibility of the director general or the chief executive <e> <s> so with due respect to the noble lord lord

privatised some per cent <e> <s> of its requirements were taken from british industry <e> <s> since then a good deal of its ordering of new supplies has been placed in other countries <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask how far industry in france is supplied from outside france <e> <s> i have in mind the telecommunications industry the gas industry and the nuclear industry <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that the minister has not given the necessary assurances committing the future board of british gas which is what we are talking about <e> <s> he has paid tribute to the efficiency of british gas in the past and to the fact that it has been concerned with decentralisation in its management structure <e> <s> the noble lord has also said that in another place of which he was a member for a number of years it was easy to raise questions in connection with british gas and that he obtained responses from ministers in connection with british gas <e> <s> all that is past <e>", "<cs> that just proves the point <e> <s> that was why british gas was a nationalised body with some public responsibility <e> <s> we are now talking about the creation of a private limited company which will produce a prospectus which will indicate that if you buy shares in the company the profits to be reaped will be handsome in terms of dividend <e> <s> in that prospectus there is no public commitment nor any social responsibility <e> <s> the company has a responsibility only to service the shareholders which is a totally different environment from the environment in which british gas now operates <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that the increase in unemployment in the regions has happened at the same time as there has been a substantial reduction in regional aid <e> <s> when that policy was initiated the government suggested that it was a cost-effective way of dispensing regional aid <e> <s> is it not time that the impact of the disastrous <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a very sad statement <e> <s> last week we heard about british shipbuilders and <e>", "<cs> my lords i was saying that this is a sad statement <e> <s> last week we had a loss of jobs in british shipbuilding which is another traditional industry of this country <e> <s> today we are faced with further redundancies in the railway building industry which is an industry with a proud tradition and a long record whose locomotives are operating in all parts of the world and particularly in the former colonies in the commonwealth <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords but the minister seems to have misunderstood my comments maybe it was my fault <e> <s> i have a deep affection for brel and for british rail which i served for years as a member of the board <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that dr blix the head of the international atomic energy authority stated this week as reported in the <e>", "<cs> my lords has the attention of the minister been drawn to the report in yesterdays <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene briefly to say from these benches that we wish the noble lord lord gisborough every encouragement and support in the bill which he has introduced <e> <s> it is one of the good things about the house of lords that we can draw on a good deal of wisdom and experience in the various fields which we discuss <e>", "<cs> my lords may i encourage the minister to accept the urgency of this matter as expressed by the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne because the less uncertainty there is the better <e> <s> may i ask him whether under the terms of this inquiry or as a separate inquiry within his department he will examine the economic consequences in terms of employment return on assets and so in of the mergers that are taking place <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my colleague my noble friend lord diamond <e> <s> i accept all that has been said by the noble lords lord boyd-carpenter and lord bruce-gardyne that this is not a perfect formula but it gives us the opportunity of inviting the minister to say what are the considerations which will influence him in the timing of taking british gas to the market <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add a sentence or two to the pleas of the noble lords lord carmichael of kelvingrove and lord mackie of benshie <e> <s> like both of them i have been approached by individuals who are involved in the housing association movement <e> <s> i have the greatest respect for them because they are taking up these duties with a strong community interest <e> <s> it seems unfortunate that people who are prepared to give their time in the interest of building a community in this way should be discriminated against <e> <s> that is what it means <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but could he not say further that the rules of the association are monitored and approved by the housing corporation which is outside the scope of the independent authority of these little associations to which he refers <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not somewhat nave to consult the iba and the bbc in this matter when they are enjoying all the advantages of the monopoly <e> <s> is not an element of public interest involved <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the deterioration in the service of british rail may be due to the old rolling stock that exists <e> <s> is it consistent with maintaining an efficient railway <e>", "<cs> my lords may i press the noble lord the minister about his promise to iron out some of the anomalies in the respective rating systems in scotland and england <e> <s> is he aware that the exxon company opened a million ethylene plant in fife last week and that the local authority has imposed on it a rates burden of million per annum <e> <s> the firm has said that that is four times the amount of rates it would have to pay if that factory had been situated south of the border <e> <s> can the noble lord the minister give me some assurance that those disincentives to investment will be taken care of in any new statutes <e>", "<cs> i congratulate the noble lord lord dulverton not only on the content of his amendment but also on the very persuasive and succinct manner in which he has moved it <e> <s> no one is better qualified than the noble lord lord dulverton because of his abiding interest not only in forestry but also in the broader field of wildlife conservation and nature conservation in general <e> <s> whatever respect the conservation lobby has for the noble lord lord dulverton here in this country he has been recognised internationally for his interest in wildlife conservation <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the minister appreciates that i shall require time to study his comprehensive reply <e> <s> i was rather disappointed at the reaction of the minister <e> <s> i thought that he was unduly complacent and unduly defensive about the present situation <e> <s> that situation is intolerable in scotland <e> <s> i shall however study the new provisions included in the national health service amendment bill that the noble lord has suggested might cover the points of concern not only to myself but also to the large number of organisations involved which have invited me to state their case tonight <e> <s> i shall study them <e> <s> if it is necessary i shall return to this matter at report stage <e> <s> but if the situation which i have described is about to be covered in the new national health service amendment bill which is about to come to us then it is very acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords in addition to the environmental bodies which have been consulted in this matter can the minister tell me what are the findings of the research department of the forestry commission on the effect of acid rain on the forests of this country and of scandinavia as a result of emissions from power stations <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment which has been proposed <e> <s> at a later stage i hope not tonight we shall reach amendment no <e> <s> in my name which deals with the regional structure of the organisation <e> <s> however tonight we are specifically dealing with the regional structure of the consumer council <e> <s> while the bill goes some way to meet the requirements of the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i concur in the ministers final statement that one could not do better than hire a scottish chartered accountant <e> <s> i thank the minister for the assurances that he has given <e> <s> i hope that they will be fulfilled in the act if not written into the bill <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think we are operating in a difficult area <e> <s> no one will defend the abuses that have been so graphically described tonight <e> <s> at the same time we are passing a law which affects access to the countryside and which may be applied much more generally than merely to control abuses by a few hippies <e> <s> we should be careful about what we are doing <e>", "<cs> i cannot say <e> <s> our own rules on access to the countryside have no statutory power i suspect <e> <s> if you are a farmer planting within an area you would put up a fence or a notice but you would not take people before the criminal courts <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord ezra <e> <s> he has already indicated the volume of investment from pension funds that is in property <e> <s> it is very considerable <e> <s> perhaps due heed should be paid to the respresentations of the national association of pension funds who have drafted this particular amendment which stands in our names <e> <s> it is a <e>", "<cs> we have been discussing complicated matters in relation to this bill in the last two or three hours and we now come to a relatively simple issue of principle <e> <s> i hope that the minister will be as accommodating in relation to this simple issue as he has been on the other matters which have been under consideration <e> <s> my noble friend lady seear has asked that we be quite clear what we are about and what the bill is about is consumer protection <e> <s> the basic purpose of this bill is to protect the investor in the situation in which we now find ourselves <e>", "<cs> the minister indicated that the press council was the appropriate protection agency <e> <s> anyone who has followed the procedures and reports of the press council over the years will recognise that it has no statutory authority whatsoever and is regularly disregarded by the newspapers of this country <e> <s> it can publish nice little reports and censures from time to time but we are talking about protecting peoples investment <e> <s> to say that that responsibility should devolve to a code of practice by the press council is totally inadequate <e> <s> the consequences of removing the exemption would be that newspapers would have to ensure that any advice that they give on investment is neither fraudulent nor reckless <e> <s> that is the purpose of the amendment <e> <s> it seems to me to be completely desirable and to be operating in an area where protection is necessary <e>", "<cs> i shall beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> as the noble lord has just said last wednesday at pm col of the <e>", "<cs> on behalf of my noble friend lord chandos i should like to lend my support to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it is becoming increasingly apparent not only in business organisations but also in the city that there is a role for non-professionals being involved in these intricate and complex arrangements <e> <s> the stock exchange has recognised that in the appointment of outsiders if i may so call them to the stock exchange council <e> <s> even the council of lloyds has similarly recognised the contribution which can be made by the outsiders rather than the professionals <e> <s> it is important that that should be quantified <e> <s> that should not be overlooked <e> <s> therefore a third might be the appropriate figure and give the appropriate balance in this organisation and i have pleasure in supporting the proposed amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i add if the minister is to consider this again if the noble lord would press him so to do that it is not uncommon in city institutions such as the court of the bank of england normally to have a trade union representative he does not attend as a representative <e> <s> he is there as a member of the court and accepts the full responsibility in the same way as someone suggested in the amendment might act on the sib <e> <s> recognising his full responsibility as a member of the sib and not directly as the voice of the trade unions involved i take the ministers point that it would be quite wrong to have someone recognised as a representative of the workers he is there because of his experience but it is important such a representative is included in nationalised industries from time to time and there is similar recognition <e>", "<cs> on behalf of my noble friend lord chandos may i add my voice to the persuasive remarks made by the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey and the noble lord lord ezra <e> <s> we must ask ourselves what is the purpose of the bill <e> <s> the purpose is that the city may be properly organised and that small investors shall be protected in making use of financial services <e> <s> i know that it is the governments objective to extend share ownership <e> <s> british telecom is one example of this and i believe that the tsb is now endeavouring to attract over million <e>", "<cs> i too declare an interest <e> <s> i am a colleague of the noble lord lord obrien on the international advisory council of morgan grenfell <e> <s> therefore i shall refrain from any comment in connection with the guinness takeover <e> <s> i listened carefully to what the noble lord lord williams said and i am not sure that i was convinced by his arguments <e>", "<cs> all i am saying is that the case has not been proved that a statutory body would do it better or more effectively or more quickly <e> <s> all i am saying is that once one introduces the statutory element one may change the character of this body <e> <s> it calls on the secretary of state to make appointments to the body rather than the broad representation which presently exists and obviously operates satisfactorily <e> <s> i am arguing that we have an institution which has operated quickly effectively and satisfactorily over years <e> <s> i am not convinced that there is an argument for changing the basis of that organisation <e>", "<cs> before this bill passes the last rites of the committee stage i should like as one of the spectators of these proceedings to pay a compliment first to the minister for his dedication and understanding in handling this bill secondly to the labour benches for mounting such a formidable team who have exercised the rightful duties of this house as a revising chamber with a great deal of expertise and knowledge and thirdly to the noble lord lord hacking who was well briefed by the law society and who has also contributed to our knowledge and experience in this field <e>", "<cs> the committee will recall that when discussing this matter earlier most of us were reacting to the press report and the television picture of the vandalism created by the so-called hippy convoys <e> <s> inevitably in this chamber there was a somewhat extreme reaction that the countryside and private property must be protected from this form of vandalism <e> <s> at the same time some of us were greatly concerned that in drafting new legislation to contain or prevent this nuisance the legitimate rights of ramblers hill-walkers bird-watchers and others who enjoy the countryside should not be reduced <e> <s> i mentioned at that time that i had been responsible as chairman of the forestry commission for million acres of land in this country and had some reasonable experience of ensuring that there should be public access to the countryside that could be contained could be legitimate and could be useful without in any way damaging the forests or the open spaces for which the foresty commission had responsibility <e>", "<cs> i am not sure <e>", "<cs> because of the grouping of amendments as the noble lord lord ross of marnock pointed out the scottish dimension intrudes in this debate <e> <s> our discussion is not entirely concerned with the word only within the limited scope of the amendment of the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> the amendments of the noble lord lord ross are included in the grouping according to my understanding <e>", "<cs> an essential small pharmacy <e> <s> it is the social obligation to provide essential services <e> <s> i was about to say that an essential small pharmacy in scotland dispensing nhs items a year could receive a year in scotland but almost double if dispensing the same number south of the border <e> <s> it occurs to me that this is an anomaly that should be addressed by the government <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness will take advantage of her reply to deal with that point <e>", "<cs> we have to have some respect for the integrity of pharmacists as well as others who may be sitting in judgment in such cases <e> <s> perhaps we shall discuss this at greater length when we come to that amendment <e> <s> however the taxpayers interest as well as social obligations seem to me to be reasonably balanced in the legislation before us and we on these benches support it <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be churlish of me not to accept the ministers offer <e> <s> the noble lord will recall that the thinking behind the bill originally was to include the words a sufficient number <e> <s> the house felt that those words were not satisfactory and rejected them in favour of a proper balance <e> <s> a proper balance in a body of this kind so far as i am concerned does not mean a preponderance of practitioners despite the expertise that will be necessary in discharging their duty <e> <s> we are talking about an investor protection body <e> <s> it would be unwise to have a preponderance of practitioners despite their obvious knowledge and expertise in a very complex subject <e> <s> if the sib is to have standing if it is to be regarded as independent and to be outside special interests it is essential that there should not be a preponderance of practitioners <e> <s> in view of the assurances given to secure a proper balance i beg leave to withdraw my amendment and i look forward to the wording that is to be introduced <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for that helpful reply <e> <s> is the minister aware however that this question is prompted by the report in the responsible financial press to the effect that mr john kay the distinguished director of the institute of fiscal studies was asked by his right honourable friend whether he would serve on the sib but that this was vetoed by the chancellor of the exchequer <e> <s> since mr kay is a considerable critic of government taxation policies can i be assured that political affiliations will not influence appointments to the securities and investments board <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for delaying the house on this matter but i was not present when your lordships discussed it previously although i raised the question of anomalies in the compensation for essential scottish pharmacies in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister now that he has created the essential framework through the financial services bill for the changes that are taking place in the city whether he <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether the present difficulty will prejudice the governments support for this distinguished college which has contributed so much particularly in the important field of industrial relations to preparing people for responsibilities in that field <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there is considerable resentment in scotland over the fact that the government are doing nothing in this case although they agreed to underwrite birminghams bid for the olympic games <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister assure us that in the prospectus for any new issue in privatisation schemes some reference will be made to the labour partys plans for renationalisation in the event of its electoral victory <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the transport of coal is the biggest contributor to british rail revenue so far as freight is concerned and that that revenue was lost to some extent during the miners strike when traffic was transferred to road transport which is environmentally damaging <e> <s> what steps are being taken to ensure that coal is now transported substantially or overwhelmingly by rail which is less offensive to the environment <e>", "<cs> my lords did i understand the minister to say that the international atomic energy authority had established that there were design weaknesses in the construction of the chernobyl plant <e> <s> is he aware that this has since been confirmed by british nuclear scientists who have visited the soviet union on the matter <e> <s> can he tell the house what authority the international atomic energy authority will have to impose proper safety regulations to prevent a recurrence of this disaster <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that since the provisions of the financial services act which have recently been brought forward to deal with a specific case are in operation it is too early to condemn self-regulation as a means of supervising these affairs <e> <s> may i congratulate the government on the steps that they have taken to implement immediately the provisions in the financial services act covering insider dealing <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much welcome the references in the statement to dealing with the problem of unemployment in respect of job counselling training and so on <e> <s> however i regret that there is no reference to any discussion of high interest rates which are certainly impeding investment which must be the basis of stimulating new industrial development <e> <s> i wonder whether any consideration was given at the summit to the question of securing reductions in interest rates as we in this country are suffering from the highest interest rates in any of the ec countries <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the western isles will not be pleased to be bracketed with brent haringey and lambeth <e> <s> can he state the total amount outstanding in respect of the western isles compared with the three london boroughs which he has mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords i too like the noble lord lord mishcon did not anticipate that there would be a lengthy statement in part of this afternoons proceedings in the house <e> <s> i agreed to speak on behalf of the alliance and to welcome this bill but i apologise to the house and to the minister for the fact that i too have to leave at a fairly early hour <e> <s> however like the noble lord lord mishcon i am reassured since my experience of these matters is substantially around sports grounds in scotland that the noble lord lord ross of marnock as the president of the scottish football association will make a much more authoritative comment than i can <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords despite the fact that the opportunity is given to appeal against these valuations is the minister aware of the present situation in which the ethylene plant in fife is rated at million per annum payable to the local authority whereas if the same plant had been erected south of the border the rates payable would be million <e> <s> is not that a considerable disincentive to inward investment in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister expedite those discussions since there is a very large investment in an area of high unemployment in the west of scotland which is in jeopardy at the moment <e> <s> incoming foreign companies cannot understand why rates should be so based that it is at least twice as expensive to invest in scotland as it is in england <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the number of minutes per hour allowed for commercial advertising over commercial stations at the moment are set by statute or at least incorporated in the licence <e> <s> can we be assured that the same allocation of time observed in present commercial licensing will be observed when the new channels come on stream <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to apologise first for the absence of lord wilson of langside who as the noble and learned lord advocate will appreciate has considerable experience in this field <e> <s> he spoke to me on the telephone and promised this may not be to the delight of the lord advocate that by the time we reach the committee stage of the bill the campsie hills will be thawed out and he will be able to make the journey to offer professional and wise comment on these proceedings <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all noble lords from all sides both critics and supporters who have participated in this debate <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in the interests of invisible exports in the much maligned city in most modern banks there is a wide range of languages including japanese arabic german spanish and russian and that that assists them in conducting this kind of business <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may congratulate the minister on anticipating the report of the european communities committee which will be debated in this house on tuesday <e> <s> it may be that some of the comments we have for tonight can be held until we have the full-scale debate on the report of that committee which is being chaired by the noble lord lord gallacher because the committee does in fact argue the case for taking more agricultural land into forestry <e>", "<cs> my lords i confess that when i saw the name of the noble lord lord brockway on this motion last week when i looked at the order paper i did not anticipate that the debate would take place at so late an hour <e> <s> i thought also that it would give me an opportunity to pay tribute to the noble lord lord brockway for his consistent commitment to the cause of peace disarmament and human rights <e> <s> it is a concern which i am happy to say i share with him <e> <s> he must feel somewhat encouraged to see that there are no fewer than six speakers from the alliance benches here tonight contributing to the support for his cause <e>", "<cs> my lords while i share the concern of the noble lord who has raised this question is the minister aware that the british banks referred to have been actively engaged in the past five years in acquiring us banks <e> <s> is there any danger of retaliation in the event of any prohibition being established <e> <s> does the minister not feel that there is adequate provision in the consideration of the monopolies and mergers commission of public interest in dealing with this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches very much welcome the report submitted by the noble lord lord gallacher on behalf of his committee <e> <s> it is rather surprising that despite the attachment of the community to the common agricultural policy any policy statement on other forms of land use seems to have escaped it <e> <s> however the fact that agricultural land is to be taken out of production and alternative use is to be found for that land requires the community and the government to look at the alternatives <e> <s> in a sense lord gallachers committee anticipated the government statement which was made last week <e> <s> it endorses the use of better quality land for forestry purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the circumstances mentioned are a result of the collapse of the regional policy of the government <e> <s> some restoration of a sensible regional policy would prevent the excessive pressure on land and housing in the south-east and would enable us to utilise the infrastructure which is available in the north <e>", "<cs> my lords the content of this bill has been well covered this afternoon by experts in this house <e> <s> once more we have the good fortune to be able to draw on a wide range of experience in dealing with this matter <e> <s> i very much welcome the opening statement of the minister in which he said that abandonment is a problem for the future but steps have to be taken now <e> <s> it is almost unique in political experience these days to find anticipated difficulties being dealt with at the appropriate time <e> <s> what we are dealing with this afternoon is providing the legislative framework which makes these anticipated necessary steps real <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister say whether the experience of scottish football has been studied in this connection <e> <s> hooliganism has disappeared from the scottish football clubs which are now playing to record attendances at all football stadia in scotland <e> <s> is the practical experience of this dramatic change being studied by the minister and the football authorities south of the border <e>", "<cs> on these benches we had no view on this amendment and we were content to listen to the arguments <e> <s> as the noble lord lord bruce of donington has said this bill is about banking supervision arising from the weaknesses that were revealed in the johnson matthey affair <e> <s> this amendment of the noble lord lord bruce raises another equally important question on the relationship between the treasury and the bank <e> <s> this is not an easy relationship <e> <s> it happens in many countries that there is difficulty in the relationships particularly between a new government and its central bank <e> <s> i have found in my own experience that many countries have looked to the bank of england and to the relationship which exists in this country based on habit tradition and good sense and have accepted the kind of relationship which exists <e> <s> from these benches we should not feel justified in changing that relationship <e> <s> i am much persuaded by the noble lord lord thorneycroft who said let the body which is reporting be responsible for its own report <e> <s> it occurs to me therefore that the pressing of this amendment would hardly be justified and i could not recommend that my colleagues should support it <e>", "<cs> like other noble lords who have spoken we too are rather puzzled by the amendment which suggests that there is some limitation on the chancellor of the exchequer requesting a report from the bank of england <e> <s> in my knowledge and experience i should say that this is quite unlikely <e> <s> indeed as has been said before the bill is before us today because of the weaknesses of the johnson matthey case <e> <s> as i recall the chancellor and parliament requested a report from the bank of england on johnson matthey received it and debated it publicly <e>", "<cs> i agree with the general view that has been expressed by the noble lords lord obrien and lord bruce-gardyne because as i said during the discussion on an earlier amendment i feel that in the relationship between the treasury and the bank the balance is just about right <e> <s> i do not propose to rehearse that argument <e>", "<cs> we have dealt with the question of joint appointments before on a previous amendment and i simply subscribe to what i said on that occasion <e> <s> i agree that throughout the amendments so far discussed there seems to be an implication or a suggestion that somehow or other the bank is associated with some cosy city club and therefore we have to establish the supremacy of the treasury <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord lord bruce will not divide on this matter <e> <s> if there is an extraordinary case of the chancellor of the exchequer exercising his authority and removing an independent member from office would not parliament provide the facilities for discussing this by a private notice question or a debate of some kind <e> <s> the chancellor of the exchequer is answerable to parliament <e> <s> if it were an extraordinary case it would presumably be raised as a subject of public debate in the same way as the appointment of john kay and the sib was a matter of general comment and debate <e> <s> that facility is available <e> <s> to insist that the chancellor <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that assurance <e> <s> i have some sympathy with the point of view expressed by the noble lord lord williams of elvel but with that assurance from the government i hope that he will not press this amendment to a division <e> <s> the position is satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to thank the noble lord lord ellenborough and if he can spare a moment he might even accept the compliment <e> <s> we are indebted to him for his courageous speech in which he invited the government to think again as regards this very contentious piece of legislation <e> <s> it was courageous because the noble lord is sitting on these benches but he is also speaking on behalf of the national association of ratepayers <e> <s> they are not exactly the militant tendency <e> <s> on the whole they tend to be rather sober sensible and even conservative people <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not responsible but it is a legitimate one anyway <e> <s> i cannot find any existing scottish institution of any kind be it the small traders the private traders the trade unions the citizens advice bureaux the social workers that supports this proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he has had any expert advice from the forestry commission on the impact on forestry of emissions from power stations and if so what it contained <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to be associated with the noble lord lord marshall with whom i served for a number of years on british rail property board <e> <s> i am also happy to have this opportunity of paying a compliment to the management of british rail for developing this imaginative scheme <e> <s> it provides for improved rail services in the city and a new rail link across the centre of london <e> <s> the service will provide direct links from stations south of the river to kings cross for the consequent link to the railway service that travels north of the border <e> <s> it is a reflection of the imaginative and energetic management of british rail in this area <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that her assurances that our submissions to this important conference will be both positive and constructive are extremely welcome <e> <s> can we have some assurance that we shall be made aware of these proposals so that they may be supported or criticised before submission to the conference <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the report contains reference to regional differences in health standards and that between and death rates were highest in scotland followed by the north and the north-west <e> <s> will the minister accept in order that the economies of these areas might be improved that it is unwise to cut by per cent <e> <s> regional development funds <e>", "<cs> may i interrupt the noble baroness <e> <s> i think that the minister assured us that we were discussing a bill which would affect england and wales if it was passed <e> <s> inevitably england and wales would follow a similar pattern <e>", "<cs> this is not an argument about dates <e> <s> we have already had that argument on the previous amendment <e> <s> however it is an argument in favour of conducting an experiment before embarking on a massive constitutional change <e> <s> there is no doubt that everyone feels that the present rating system is unsatisfactory <e> <s> in scotland where this bill would apply there is also considerable resentment and a considerable volume of opinion that the proposed system is no better and that it contains within it unfairness and inequality <e>", "<cs> in view of the vote that was taken earlier on the question of dates i shall on this occasion accept the advice of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this has been a very interesting and i hope a useful debate <e> <s> as i said at the outset this is not tinkering with the detail of the bill it represents a fundamental change in the way in which we would raise money for local government <e> <s> the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls does not think that this is the appropriate place for this amendment <e> <s> however the bill concerns raising money for local services and it is obviously appropriate that if we believe there is a better system than the existing system we should have an

assumed that in this chamber we did not vote against second reading <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble lord was not present he might even have been convinced by the weight of argument that took place

the bill i am not prepared to move it at this stage <e> <s> i am not sure whether my colleague lord mackie of benshie agrees <e> <s> i shall leave him to speak for himself <e>", "<cs> may i add my plea to the invitation that the minister should look at this matter again <e> <s> it is a quite complicated issue as has been demonstrated by the noble lords lord mackie of benshie and lord morton of shuna <e> <s> it is not an easy issue <e> <s> we are not necessarily talking about shooting-lodges <e> <s> there are many working-class homes where even if the people cannot afford a mediterranean holiday or whatever and like living in the heart of the city they may enjoy very much having a little chalet or second home in the country <e> <s> it is an economic way of having a family house where the family can meet occasionally <e>", "<cs> i very much appreciate the statement made by the minister and i am delighted that he will give it further consideration <e> <s> perhaps i may say a word about the discussion which has taken place and assure the noble lord lord ross of marnock that i do not treat letters from the national trust lightly <e> <s> however i am sure he will recognise that with the number of representations and the amount of advice which we have received in the last few weeks it is easy to overlook a particular letter <e> <s> i am indebted to the noble earl lord perth

bairns <e> <s> this happens all day and all night long <e> <s> the people who run these homes are concerned about meeting this human need and not about form-filling and all the other complications of bureaucracy <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the best intentions of the government to return the turks and caicos islands to a democratic form of government <e> <s> i also welcome the advice of the minister that she recognises that democracy in the turks and caicos islands will always be a fragile plant <e> <s> they have no long tradition of democratic government and experiences of the last few years indicate that democratic government can be substantially abused <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies may i draw his attention to the fact that the next amendment to be moved deals with that point <e> <s> it may save the time of the committee if we debated the issue once instead of two or three times <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble baroness but i have a note here from the cbi which i quote <e>", "<cs> the cbi <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i am not convinced by the minister <e> <s> he is confusing two things <e> <s> if one puts to business concerns in scotland

leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in his reply the minister has tempted us to open up the general debate again <e> <s> he has said that the questions asked almost suggest that the opposition

discredited system <e> <s> however we have no intention of replacing one discredited system with another one <e> <s> the argument yesterday concerned an alternative form of local income tax <e>",

minister will also incorporate in his consideration the position of the homes as such as rateable properties and that the whole matter of the status of refuge homes as well as the status of the temporary occupants of refuge homes will be considered and that the minister will come back to us <e>", "<cs> my lords in anticipation of the debate i turned back to an interview that was given by the most reverend primate archbishop of canterbury in <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble earl how important is converting <e> <s> worse than people who see the truth are people who hang on to old ideas in which they have ceased to believe <e>", "<cs> i am much indebted to the chairman for permitting me to move an amendment which was obviously out of order because it enabled me to

happening to them <e> <s> they do not always follow the proceedings of your lordships house <e> <s> if this matter were debated publicly in scotland and a vote taken then the government may be satisfied as to whether the people accept accountability and involvement which is the purpose of the entire exercise <e> <s> however at this late stage on this easter thursday i do not propose to detain the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bruce of donington suggested that an apology was due from these benches for a lack of critical assessment of this bill <e> <s> i am tempted not to rehearse the position of the alliance but to say just a few words about the bill at this concluding stage <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister make some assessment of the value of this industry to the scottish economy <e> <s> will he keep in mind that it is bringing the consumption of salmon within the reach of many more people than could previously afford to buy it <e>", "<cs>

ministers but i shall learn by the process whether it is wise <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps we shall return to the equalities of the present system <e> <s> i agree completely with the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter that the present system is full of anomalies <e> <s> we are in the position in which we are seriously looking at the revision of the method of financing local government because the

was rather thin and as i believe in exercising democracy i felt it unwise to proceed to vote <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to reply to one or two of the points made during this very interesting and somewhat lengthy discussion <e> <s> the criticism offered by the noble viscount lord massereene and ferrard was dealt with by the noble lord lord mackie of benshie <e> <s> of course all forms of income tax are a form of means tax there is no doubt about that <e> <s> it is related to ones ability to pay <e> <s> i make no apology for that form of assessment of ability to pay <e> <s> it was suggested by the noble viscount and by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter that the amendment was somewhat vague and did not deal with some of the detail of application which would be inevitable if it was carried <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure we are grateful to the minister for honouring an obligation to the house <e> <s> he has given further consideration to the matter and has discussed it with scottish womens aid <e> <s> we appreciate his assurance with regard to the matter of confidentiality <e> <s> that is important but rather more important is the treatment the subject of the amendment <e> <s> while the minister told us he had spoken to scottish womens aid i presume that the proposition before the house tonight was put to its representatives <e> <s> i hope that they could understand it more readily than i <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been an extremely interesting discussion at a late hour <e> <s> i am indebted to the noble lord lord sanderson of bowden for expressing so forcibly the necessity for starting soon on harmonisation if there is to be harmonisation <e> <s> it is a very complex business <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that it is desirable to exhaust all avenues of negotiation before embarking on protectionist measures which could have international implications <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister regards it as very important that local authorities should be in a position to offer the register for sale <e> <s> does it mean a great deal to local authorities in terms of income <e> <s> the dangers involved as has been outlined by the noble lords lord grimond and lord ross of marnock indicate that this is a somewhat uneasy situation <e> <s> if the bill passes i think that it should encourage and place no impediment in the way of people registering in order that they may exercise their votes <e> <s> however i do not think that a hint that the register may be sold for commercial purposes to property developers or salesmen of one kind or another is an encouragement for people to register <e> <s> i wonder why the minister insists on this provision having conceded the first point that the register should not be available indiscriminately <e> <s> i wonder why he does not follow on logically and accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not speculate as to whether there will be a change of government or a change of secretary of state <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross and noble lords on these <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he deal with the specific point made by the noble lord lord ross of marnock about the equity of this <e> <s> a very expensive and highly rated house on which appropriate rates are paid now comes down to a fairly standard charge which will be imposed also on someone who lives in a very modest house which is a second home <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble lord lord grimond who has moved this amendment <e> <s> in earlier discussions on this bill we considered vulnerable groups <e> <s> i am not pretending that the farmers of orkney are in the same category as the vulnerable groups to which the noble lord lord ross of marnock has referred <e> <s> but there is an obvious anomaly which is being created by the bill <e> <s> if i read the figures right per cent <e> <s> of the water on orkney is metered and under this bill the local authority is bound to apportion the charges for water between the various users of water which will mean a rise of some per cent <e> <s> for certain users of water on orkney <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to associate myself with all that has been said in <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i congratulate the minister on his promotion to the front bench and promise him an interesting time <e> <s> may i also ask two questions <e> <s> would the minister agree that while this matter was debated in the house it was also debated in scotland during the election and overwhelmingly rejected <e> <s> secondly may i ask whether his attention has been drawn to speeches made in another place yesterday <e> <s> can i have an assurance that in the event of a rejection of the english legislation or of any substantial amendment to that legislation there would be second thoughts about the poll tax in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords finally may i ask whether the minister is aware that the last time a poll tax was introduced in this country was in and that it was followed by the peasants revolt <e> <s> is the minister not equally apprehensive about the application of this law which has been rejected by the people of scotland at this tme <e>", "<cs> i was a member of the british rail board for nearly years and if there was one thing we were good at it was producing plans <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord mulley will recall the booklets for plans that we were able to produce in british rail on its future development corporate plans freight plans and so on <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the minister can comment on the argument of the noble lord lord sefton when he said that the reason waterloo was chosen was that it was commercially more attractive <e> <s> if that is so i regard it as a very important argument <e> <s> we must keep in mind that the whole project is being financed by private capital and therefore must be attractive and viable <e> <s> there is no claim on the state for financing this project <e> <s> was that a serious consideration in the decision to concentrate on waterloo <e>", "<cs> my lords may i declare an interest in this matter since i am associated with one of the companies concerned in the inquiry <e> <s> however can i invite the minister to take on board the urgency of the matter since uncertainty hanging over companies and individuals does no good to them or to the reputation of the city <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask the minister to recognise that may day is traditionally a celebration of the contribution of the working people to the welfare of this nation <e> <s> it would be a great mistake if we were to depart from that celebration and make it a monopoly on the part of the eastern european nations <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that forestry is a major contributor to employment in the countryside <e> <s> it now employs people <e> <s> therefore may i have an assurance that there will be continued government support for an expanding forestry policy in both the public and the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord answer as to the powers of the european commission in commenting on the proposed merger <e> <s> do i assume that the ruling of the office of fair trading will be what will guide her majestys government rather than a european community directive <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that there is a great danger of this country becoming a divided nation and that it would be wrong to diminish or dismantle in any way a forum which is designed to arrive at consensus industrial policies for this countrys welfare <e>", "<cs> my lords can i ask the noble lord to read the report of monopolies and mergers commission on the proposed takeover of the royal bank of scotland by the hong kong and shanghai banking corporation and the standard chartered bank which lays down very firmly that it is not in the public interest for a scottish banking institution to be owned by a foreign company <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord confirm that the support for this promotion of trade in south africa is against the spirit of the nassau agreement <e> <s> the question is not whether we are in favour of sanctions but whether we are prepared to accept the implications of the nassau agreement in agreeing to restrict trade in certain areas <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give any assurance that the scottish note which circulates with great acceptance north and south of the border will be protected in any review that is undertaken <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to express appreciation to the secretary of state for his review this afternoon of his departments activities as contained in his statement <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate him on the incisiveness and enthusiasm with which he has tackled very serious problems in his department <e> <s> from these benches we welcome the approach of the secretary of state in bringing the academic studies closer to the requirement of industry <e> <s> we hope that that will be successful <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the encouraging answer that the minister gave in regard to the experience in scotland can i anticipate the debate which will follow by asking whether this is not another good argument for allowing scotland to run its own affairs <e>", "<cs> my lords when i read the list of speakers in todays debate my regret was that the house had not moved to edinburgh for the debate <e> <s> i am sure that it would have enhanced the reputation of the house in its concern for scottish affairs <e>", "<cs> my lords in addition to the reference to the office of fair trading will the secretary of state keep in mind his reserve powers in the exercising of the golden share in this case <e> <s> will he consider that separately from any report he receives from the oft <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the house for not putting down my name to speak <e> <s> i simply subscribe to all the eloquent things that have been said by previous speakers about our association with australia and our debt to that country <e> <s> just as the noble lord lord parry has said something about the welsh contribution to australia it occurs to me that the nation which has exported more of its people to the canadas and australias of this world than any other country is scotland for obvious economic reasons as well as for the great zest for pioneering and adventure of those people <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble earl lord perth for having introduced this debate <e> <s> he will forgive me if i do not share his lack of enthusiasm for the channel tunnel <e> <s> the debate gives me the opportunity to talk on my favourite subject which is forestry in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for that interesting reply <e> <s> despite the very substantial figures that he has quoted is he aware that the convention of scottish local authorities has indicated that the amounts allocated particularly on the current expenditure budget represent only half of the amount that will be required <e> <s> in that event will the government meet the shortfall <e> <s> further will he confirm that the amount expended on the collection of rates under the present system will be doubled under the new arrangements <e> <s> does he consider that that represents a sensible allocation of resources for local authority expenditure at a time when social services and other essential services are being severely limited <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm this <e> <s> did he state that the cost of collecting rates at the present time is million per annum <e> <s> under the new arrangements that will he million per annum <e> <s> that was justified on the basis that they would be collected from more people <e> <s> will he confirm that he is collecting the same amount of money <e> <s> it is the costs of raising that amount of money that are significant not the number of people who will have to pay rates <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister take note of the fact that a fare of is now available and on offer between london and paris <e> <s> in contrast the fare between london and glasgow or london and edinburgh is <e> <s> can the minister exercise some authority to induce a measure of competition in this area so that prices may be reduced <e>", "<cs> my lords since assurances have been given with regard to the wildfowling and stocking interests may i ask the minister whether similar protection is being given to the people who earn their living on the estate foresters and others who have to work in the area or is it strictly for the birds <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister gives some assurances with regard to expediting these investigations <e> <s> a number of individuals have been <e>", "<cs> my lords on the occasion of the proposed ministerial visits the finnish visit to this country and that of the secretary of state for scotland to finland will ministers take the opportunity to thank finnish industry for its million investment in urban new towns which is generating jobs and is providing an outlet for the timber industry particularly in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches congratulations are in order to two noble lords <e> <s> one is the noble viscount lord weir <e> <s> i join in congratulating the noble viscount on what was a model maiden speech <e> <s> i congratulate him also on another count <e> <s> he is the head of a large engineering company in the west of scotland <e> <s> in that area there has been a rapid decline of engineering and heavy industry but weirs of cathcart have shown something which is relevant to the discussion in the house today <e> <s> they have adjusted and adapted to the changing market in which they operate <e> <s> as a result weirs of cathcart contribute greatly to the survival of heavy industry in the west of scotland <e> <s> on that account also the noble viscount deserves congratulations <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the prime consideration of the government that the boots should not leak <e>", "<cs> my lords although the minister states that more has been spent on the national health service will he accept that for various reasons there is still serious underfunding <e> <s> in that event how can he justify the fact that a married couple on a year receive remission from tax under the new arrangements but a couple with per annum receive <e> <s> is that socially defensible <e> <s> are the governments priorites right <e>", "<cs> my lords i put my name down to speak in this debate because i wished to assure the noble lord lord peston from these benches that we share his concern for the promotion of business education <e> <s> i want to make a general comment and deal briefly with the position in scotland for which i assume the minister has no responsibility whatsoever <e> <s> before doing so i wish to congratulate the noble marquess lord huntly on a model speech <e> <s> i had always associated the title of the marquess of huntly with estates in aberdeenshire and the grouse moors <e> <s> how delightful it is to see that the noble marquess is an mba and a practical teacher in the field of management studies <e> <s> that i think indicates the changing climate in relation to management studies <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a certain finality about the title of this bill regional development grants termination bill <e> <s> as the noble lord lord williams of elvel said it signals the end of an agreed policy in using investment grants as an instrument of economic policy and regional development <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> will the minister confirm that the government are committed to the hectare target which has long been regarded as acceptable for forestry in the united kingdom <e> <s> can he identify the new investors that he hopes to attract to forestry because many of the traditional investors will find other opportunities for rewarding investment in other areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish the minister a very happy easter <e> <s> may i ask him whether when he returns to the borders where he will spend easter he will meet his neighbours who are active foresters and consult with them as to the devastating impact of these tax changes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we all welcome the governments commitment to exchange rate stability <e> <s> however in pursuit of that objective will the government review their attitude towards joining the european monetary system which would achieve that end <e>", "<cs> my lords before the house goes into committee i wish to raise a question that is not strictly related <e>", "<cs> my lords it must be the easter break that generates a certain amount of enthusiasm to become involved <e> <s> however i raised a question this morning with the leader of the house on the subject of the operation of this bill and the constitutional position <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like the minister to comment on this <e> <s> if the amendment that the house is about to consider were to be passed what would be the effect of that in so far as a bill has now been implemented before it has the full authority of this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i raised this matter with the leader of the house this morning because of the constitutional position to which the noble lord lord tordoff referred <e> <s> in view of the anxiety that has been expressed would it be convenient for the leader of the house between now and third reading to consider this issue from the constitutional view point and not in relation to the department of trade and industry <e> <s> it is a matter that affects the power and responsibilities of this house <e>", "<cs> i am disappointed that the minister has not responded to the invitation to have this monitoring process which the noble lord lord peston has suggested <e> <s> i can find no other way of operating it other than by the proposed amendment <e> <s> we could have this interesting monitoring sample to see how the measure works <e> <s> that should commend itself to a minister who is not afraid to experiment in his department and in other areas with which he is involved <e> <s> he makes a most unusual claim <e> <s> in rejecting the amendment and in changing the system of regional development grants he has said that scotland is doing remarkably well <e> <s> it is doing remarkably well under the present system and it is the present system that we are seeking to retain <e> <s> of course unemployment is declining and of course there are more people in scotland in the electronics industry than there are in coal mining steel and shipbuilding combined and that is a triumph <e> <s> it is a triumph for regional policy and for the scottish development agency which has been the instrument of the policy which the minister now hopes to discard <e> <s> that is the unfortunate fact <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know what harm scotland has done to have two controversial measures affecting scotland on the first day after the hols <e> <s> but i am sure that the minister will have some sympathy with me doubling as i have on these diminished benches of the social democratic party in order to deal with economic matters and scottish housing at the same time <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the ministers reference to the secrecy of that information <e> <s> can he tell us whether any calculations are made in the department on what the cost is compared with what the cost might have been if we had joined the european monetary system <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that the highland region has received million in regional aid in the last years <e> <s> it would be quite disastrous for the region if we were to lose that opportunity of further european aid <e> <s> will he <e>", "<cs> my lords by the end of this debate i hope the minister will understand the very deep concern in this house about the new policy <e> <s> the fact that the government are departing from what has been a reasonably successful policy in the past creates a good deal of apprehension to all of us who wish to see an expanding forestry industry <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister give the geographical distribution of the inquiries <e> <s> will he say how many which are government-assisted are from the south-east and how many from the less-advantaged areas such as the north-east and scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister comment on the geographical distribution of share ownership <e> <s> is he aware that in the south-east per cent <e> <s> of the population are share owners as against per cent <e> <s> in scotland <e> <s> is not that further evidence of the north-south divide and does not that cause him some concern <e>", "<cs> my lords in committee i raised the question of the date of operation of the bill which is the subject of the amendment <e> <s> i should have had more sympathy with my noble friend lord sefton of garston <e>", "<cs> my lords in committee i raised the question of the date of operation of the bill <e> <s> since then i have had some correspondence with the leader of the house and the minister in which precedents were quoted to me on the propriety of dating a bill from st march when we are considering it on st april <e> <s> i took independent advice on the matter and i am satisfied that it is constitutionally in order but while being constitutionally in order it is not a desirable practice <e> <s> i hope that in future the house and its place in these matters will be respected and not anticipated in legislation that is brought before it <e> <s> i received the assurance from the minister and the leader of the house that the procedure was in order and i accept it <e>", "<cs> i am rather disappointed that we have not been able to convince the noble baroness lady carnegy of lour and the noble lord lord strathclyde of the wisdom of the amendment <e> <s> i should have thought that with the experience which the noble baroness has had in local government she would welcome a new agency which could inject a degree of urgency into dealing with this terrible social problem <e>", "<cs> my name is attached to the amendment <e> <s> we would argue that the position outlined in the bill is anomalous <e> <s> all recipients of financial assistance should be subject to the same degree of supervisory control <e> <s> the procedures and mechanisms for doing so are already in existence and need only be extended to cover the whole range of landlords <e> <s> the noble lord lord morton of shuna has already mentioned the danger of a re-emergence of rachmanism unless there is appropriate supervision <e> <s> i suspect that the minister may wish to avoid that <e> <s> i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> we are again on the subject of the relationship between the local authority and the new agency <e> <s> it is important at this stage that their respective roles and responsibilities towards each other should be clearly defined <e> <s> bearing in mind the very important involvement of local authorities in housing in scotland i believe it may be desirable that this should be written in <e> <s> i am sure that the local authorities will welcome it and it need not impede the activities of the housing association <e> <s> i hope therefore that this may be accepted <e>", "<cs> we are getting near to the end of the proceedings tonight and i do not propose to extend them <e> <s> however the minister said that that would be one of the functions of scottish homes and that he regarded the words as unnecessary <e> <s> there is a public relations job to be done by scottish homes <e> <s> it is a new organisation <e> <s> as the noble earl lord selkirk said one of the problems in scottish housing is the conflict between the landlord and tenant and the confrontational atmosphere that arises even when one mentions the words <e> <s> i should have thought that there was a case to be made for adding the proposed wording <e> <s> it would not limit or impede scottish homes at all but perhaps give it an additional role in the public relations sense and a certain credibility and standing <e> <s> the organisation has to establish itself <e>", "<cs> my lords does the secretary of state agree that the threat of the transport and general workers union was a critical factor in the withdrawal of the ford motor company from dundee with the loss of approximately jobs <e> <s> does he also agree that it might have been wise for the secretary of state to have warned the tgwu that in the event of it carrying out its threat there could possibly have been a reference to the monopolies and mergers commission under the act which he has just quoted <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that it was common knowledge during the negotiations that there was a threat implied or otherwise that other ford workers would black the products of the dundee factory in the event of it being opened <e> <s> i am concerned not about inter-union disputes but about inward investment <e> <s> will the minister please confirm that the act provides for a monopolies and mergers commission investigation if a labour practice operates against the public interest <e> <s> can he confirm that any such threat or implied threat if carried out would come within these provisions <e>", "<cs> like the noble lord lord morton of shuna i very much welcome the response of the government to some of the points that have been made during the course of our discussion which has certainly been worthwhile <e> <s> the assurance provided by amendment no <e> <s> in connection with a written lease is very welcome and i am sure that it will satisfy the noble baroness lady carnegy of lour who raised that specific point <e> <s> if i understood it correctly the statement regarding the succession of tenancy on the death of a spouse was also welcome but it will require to be studied <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment in view of what the noble lord says <e>", "<cs> in the light of what has just been said i do not propose to press the amendment to a vote <e> <s> once more i should like to read and study what the minister has said <e> <s> he seemed to be very persuasive and at least he has persuaded himself <e> <s> i shall look at the matter as fairly as possible and i may return to it <e> <s> however i do not propose to press the amendment at this stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is extremely difficult to resist the comment that the minister speaks very rapidly about these complex problems and when he gives assurances one does not have the time to absorb the implications of the statement <e>", "<cs> before the amendment is withdrawn perhaps i may press the minister a little further <e> <s> the changes involved in this bill are important <e> <s> we shall have a new organisation scottish homes <e> <s> no one knows it at the moment it is a new quango <e> <s> it has to establish its authority and credibility in relation to the public <e> <s> therefore i suggest that to lay down a code or to set out criteria on which it would make judgments in this matter would be to its advantage <e>", "<cs> i am saying that it is a fact of life <e> <s> it is important if this new coalition of housing interests is to work that we should establish a new climate in tenant landlord relationship <e> <s> i suggest that accepting this amendment and laying down a criterion on which we judge good landlords could be to the advantage of this bill and its acceptability to the scottish public <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for the assurance he has given <e> <s> i should naturally have preferred to see that important obligation in the statute but nevertheless the minister has given his assurance in the name of the secretary of state for scotland and i accept it in that way <e> <s> i should not expect to see all the administrative rules laid down and approved by the house because we might then have another long debate on the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his assurance with regard to the changes in the community charge <e> <s> perhaps i may press him on the impact of the amendments which have been agreed in the other place on the business community in scotland <e> <s> he will be aware that his right honourable friend has decided that the uniform business rate will now be phased over five years <e> <s> the present business rate places scottish business at a great disadvantage <e> <s> the minister will be aware that close to his home is the exxon corporation which pays million per annum in rates <e> <s> if that plant were situated in england it would pay around million per annum in rates <e> <s> the uniform business rate <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister look at an earlier implementation of the uniform business rate within the terms of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords if i heard the minister aright he said that it was the intention to <e>", "<cs> the last reply of the minister has been a little more forthcoming than earlier replies <e> <s> he said that the amendment almost amounted to a blank cheque to the organisations but it states <e>", "<cs> that is not what i am saying <e> <s> i am suggesting that the noble lord should have a quiet talk with the minister in charge of promotion of government enterprise because the sum of almost million for the citizens advice bureaux is a drop in the bucket compared with his budget <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord lord young understands the greater importance of communicating and explaining <e> <s> i was commending the minister to have a further look at the situation because we are talking about rather poor people who are living in a new situation with new regulations about changing ones landlord about the fairness of rents and about the ability to transfer ones tenancy <e> <s> those are complicated matters for ordinary people to understand <e>", "<cs> my lords does the secretary of state agree that many sectors of british industry are aware of the opportunities for export to japan <e> <s> will he agree that they are limited by some of the constraints that are placed by the japanese authorities particularly in the financial sector and also the excessive tariffs on items such as scotch whisky <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister reply to the first point on the financial sector <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may encourage the minister to intervene at this stage since the case which has been made appears to the committee in general to be so overwhelming <e> <s> i wonder whether he is convinced and therefore is prepared to make some concession <e> <s> i seem to recall when we were discussing the scottish bill that the same ground was covered and i believe that some concessions were made <e> <s> if i remember rightly some concessions were made for example in the case of homes for battered wives <e> <s> the minister may recall that <e> <s> as some concessions were made in that regard perhaps the minister would care to intervene at this stage and tell us the governments view <e>", "<cs> it is extremely difficult to reply in detail when so many figures are thrown about which are speculative as to what this would cost here and there <e> <s> it costs so much to run local government <e> <s> that money must be found from somewhere <e> <s> local income tax is based on the ability of a citizen to pay for these services and therefore as a method it is preferable to the system which is proposed in the bill and which has nothing to do with ability to pay <e>", "<cs> my lords while i welcome the statement about an index-linked ceiling will the minister agree that it makes no contribution whatsoever to removing the glaring anomaly in which an industrial plant based in scotland pays million in rates but if it were situated south of the border in carlisle or newcastle its bill would be million in rates <e> <s> can the minister give scottish industry any hope that there will he a degree of harmonisation in valuation which will take care of such anomalies <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree with the scottish development agency that the existence of regional development grants was an important contributory factor in the progress which he has reported <e> <s> in view of that will not the withdrawal of regional development grants which has just taken place on the initiative of the government work against similar results in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords did i understand the minister to say that he welcomed the restructuring of companies in order to protect them from predators <e> <s> i refer to companies with which he is familiar <e> <s> alternatively does he not believe that this would be against the principle of widespread share ownership and responsibility which he has advocated <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the minister before he sits down about the assertion which he makes repeatedly that local income tax would be much more expensive to collect than the community charge <e> <s> on what basis has he made these costings <e> <s> are the costings made up to date following the computerisation of the inland revenue <e>", "<cs> i should like to supplement the question posed by the noble lord lord jay <e> <s> i speak as someone who has just completed his community charge form since the system is now in operation in scotland <e> <s> there is no question on the form although it is quite a complicated questionnaire as to who is the earner in the household <e> <s> therefore what is the follow-up <e> <s> having completed the form and submitted it to the local authority how will that authority in the words of the noble lord lord jay then find out who is the earner and who has the liability <e> <s> does it perhaps require another questionnaire <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make a general statement as we usually do from these benches on cases of privatisation <e> <s> we have no doctrinaire attitude to privatisation versus public ownership and each case will be judged on its merits but we have a strong inclination to support the idea of a mixed economy <e> <s> in that connection i support some of the concerns which have been expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the minister whether the encouraging figures which he has quoted for are the result of the previous tax regime which is now abolished <e> <s> will the minister confirm that the planting programme of the forestry commission in the past eight years has been reduced from hectares to hectares <e> <s> is it true that private planters are now cutting back on their nursery orders which suggests a total cutback in their planting programme <e> <s> can the minister inform the house where the new investors are coming from <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether in addition to the palace of westminster and the dti mercury services are being given the opportunity to quote for other civil service departments <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the scottish experience is being aired in committee <e> <s> listening to <e>", "<cs> what will be the impact on scotland if we pass the arrangements contained in the subsequent amendments in the ministers name which give effect to the transitional arrangements <e> <s> what will this do to the existing scottish legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords considering how unpopular this legislation is in scotland can the minister give any indication of the rate of return of these forms <e> <s> is he satisfied that the forms are being returned to the degree that he expects <e>", "<cs> the amendments provide the opportunity for the minister to say a word on how the glaring anomalies drawn to his attention by representative organisations and members of the committee might be dealt with <e> <s> i know from conversations with the minister that he shares the concerns expressed about the anomalies <e>", "<cs> i should like to express my support for the remarks made by the noble lord lord morton of shuna <e> <s> i should also like to assure the minister that the amendment is designed to be helpful <e> <s> it is accepted that the community charge legislation as regards scotland is through <e> <s> however the implementation of that legislation is the matter which is before us at present <e> <s> suggest that politically it might be wise for the application of this legislation to be delayed as suggested to bring it into line with the dates of the application in england <e> <s> there is a deep-rooted feeling in scotland that we are getting it first in other words we are the guinea pigs <e> <s> it must be said that it is something we do not like as has been shown by the references made by the noble lord lord morton of shuna to the election results and the various opinion polls <e> <s> therefore it might be wise just to bring it into line with the dates of the english legislation and thereby refute the criticism that scotland is being used as a guinea pig in this case <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady carnegy of lour is missing the point <e> <s> it is not whether the sum is or but whether it is just and right that nurses in scotland should have the obligation to pay the poll tax a year before nurses in england <e> <s> i am sure that the minister with his knowledge of the nursing profession should react to this situation <e> <s> that is the issue <e> <s> it is not whether the amount is or <e> <s> it depends on the extent of the local authority spending <e>", "<cs> since the provisions of this bill will be applicable a year earlier in scotland it is therefore an immediate prospect <e> <s> the highest spending areas such as the city of glasgow are high spending not because they are irresponsible but because the need is greater <e> <s> the people who live in glasgow will be compensated to the extent of a national average which takes into account areas of less need <e> <s> in these circumstances will the people in greatest poverty in glasgow suffer even more as a result of the application of the principle which the noble lord has just enunciated <e>", "<cs> for the first time in discussions in committee on the local government finance bill i find myself at variance with the noble lord lord morton of shuna <e> <s> the effect of his amendment would be to scrap what is achieved in the amendment which follows standing in the name of the government <e> <s> as has been pointed out if the noble lord lord morton of shuna <e>", "<cs> i have heard many apologies for amendments in this chamber <e> <s> that is the latest one <e> <s> i accept it in the spirit in which it is given <e> <s> it nevertheless remains true that if this amendment is carried the present totally unsatisfactory and anomalous position in the comparison of scottish rating with english rating will not be solved <e> <s> i wish to pay tribute to the noble lord lord sanderson of bowden with whom i discussed my amendment the amendment which gives greater powers to the secretary of state not only to prescribe the principles but also to prescribe the principles and the rules in connection with the application of rating in arriving at the value of lands and heritages under this part of the bill <e>", "<cs> since the passing of this amendment would exclude my amendment no <e> <s> i should like to say that my amendment is entirely covered by the government amendment and the insertion of the words rules or <e>", "<cs> anyone who lives in scotland will grasp the significance of the amendment <e> <s> a great deal of emotion and political excitement is generated on the question of the survival of ravenscraig <e> <s> it is that which is at the root of the amendment <e> <s> naturally in scotland when people see the privatisation process taking place they think for a moment what the consequences may be <e> <s> it is to protect scotland from the undesirable features of the centralisation the thrust of profit as the sole consideration a philosophy that the noble lord lord marsh supports so eloquently that we are apprehensive <e> <s> in the amendment we are trying to build in some protection <e>", "<cs> that is not what the amendment says <e> <s> the amendment does not say that ravenscraig will inevitably remain open indefinitely <e>", "<cs> does the minister accept that with previous privatisations when there has been a commitment on the part of the official <e>", "<cs> my lords since insurance companies frequently pick up the tab for servicing and repairs to vehicles is the minister taking any action to ensure that insurance companies get value for money for repairs and services <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may also thank the noble lord for the statement <e> <s> i should like to make one comment <e> <s> noble lords who travel to this house from scotland to discuss scottish legislation find it extremely difficult to make their plans and complete their travel arrangements when announcements are made on a wednesday afternoon concerning scottish legislation on a thursday <e>", "<cs> my lords while not being complacent will the minister confirm that the adverse balance of invisible payments deficit was billion in <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of the golden share has been introduced in our debate <e> <s> it would give veto powers to the government as holders of the share <e> <s> that is not implied in the amendment which is now before us <e> <s> the amendment suggests that the secretary of state should be made aware of any drastic or fundamental changes in the private company and given the opportunity to comment on them <e> <s> members of your lordships house may feel that he will have the opportunity to comment in any case <e> <s> if that is so why should not we write it into the bill <e> <s> the noble lord lord morton of shuna has described instances where decisions affecting the scottish economy were made in detroit or elsewhere and in which the secretary of state for scotland had a substantial financial interest but was not invited to comment <e> <s> a case in point is that of the caterpillar factory <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the minister but i can recall no reference to miserable performances in anything that i said <e> <s> perhaps i may just say to him while he is committing the corporation to seven years of ravenscraig that that commitment does not necessarily fall on the new company which is being formed <e>", "<cs> my lords i recall that in committee i moved an amendment similar to that tabled by the noble lord lord mackie <e> <s> i should like to take the opportunity of echoing the sentiments of the noble earl lord selkirk in so far as the minister has listened to the argument and made an appropriate amendment <e> <s> i am sure that it will be welcomed by all the bodies in scotland which made representations to me and to the minister <e> <s> i appreciate it <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment deals with the important question of tenants rights <e> <s> your lordships may recall that in committee an amendment was moved in relation to the publicity and explanations which would be given to the public so that they may understand their rights under this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am impressed by the case made by the noble lord lord morton of shuna <e> <s> he made two very important points about cost and delay <e> <s> perhaps the minister can indicate what delays are to be encountered in proceedings of that kind before sheriffs courts in glasgow and edinburgh <e> <s> i believe that courts are overburdened and that delay is undesirable <e> <s> a tribunal is a simplified system and would appear to me to be much more efficient in dealing with such matters <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord morton of shuna has dealt at great length with the arguments which have been produced by the various organisations concerned in this matter <e> <s> i do not propose to reproduce the excellent brief which i have received from shelter and other bodies which feel strongly about this <e> <s> i ask the minister only to reply on one basic and fundamental point <e> <s> i quote from the shelter representation which says <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that with the representations that have been made to many of us notably from the institute of housing in scotland people will be somewhat reassured by the statement which has just been made by the minister <e> <s> the only point of doubt is this <e> <s> all right the guidance will be given directions may be issued by the secretary of state to scottish homes <e> <s> but there are no criteria in these general statements against which the landlords will be judged <e>", "<cs> my lords the shetland islanders must be proud at the weight being given to their representations in the house at this late hour <e> <s> it is a reflection of the seriousness with which they view their position as an island community <e> <s> i too receive representations from shetlanders and should like to associate these benches with them <e> <s> i hope that their special case will receive special consideration from the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that my question is prompted by an announcement by his right honourable friend that a further - billion will he set aside to the ecgd by the government to cover defence contracts <e> <s> can he assure me that bids for power plants in jordan or petrochemical plants in nigeria or port facilities in pakistan will be treated no less favourably than bids for frigates tanks and other defence contracts <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked the minister a specific question as to whether bids for civilian projects in which contractors in this country are involved will be treated no less favourably than bids for frigates <e> <s> tornados and tanks <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to press the minister on this matter but if a further billion is set aside by the government specifically for defence contracts does that not indicate that preference is being given within the ecgd to defence contracts as against the normal criteria for civilian contracts <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we should like to welcome the ministers statement and thank him for it <e> <s> despite the generosity of the original arrangement the proposed deal should be supported <e> <s> i realise that it is a very important commercial decision for british aerospace and i believe that it would be unwise for us to press for a decision to be made before the recess and before the house of lords has offered comment on it <e> <s> i hope that we have supported the proposition in principle and that the terms of the commission will be acceptable to british aerospace <e> <s> we hope that the uncertainty over a large sector of british industry will be relieved and that it will be in british hands <e>", "<cs> my lords is it true that any such contracts are approved by the dti and by cocom in which the united states plays a leading role <e> <s> is the minister aware that last years contract for million with john brown engineering and this years contract for million with simon-carves are welcomed in terms of employment in this country <e> <s> is it true that the soviet union has never defaulted on a credit agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to commend and support the scheme <e> <s> it must be the first occasion in the house when during a discussion on tree planting i have been able to enter into debate without necessarily defending the planting of conifers in the uplands and on marginal land <e> <s> this is a different category entirely <e> <s> we are talking about planting on much more favourable land for the growing of broadleaved trees <e> <s> it must be understood by those who talk about forestry that there are certain species for certain sites <e> <s> that applies also in relation to broadleaves <e> <s> there is no doubt that the planting of sycamore may be preferable and may give a better economic return than the planting of oak on certain sites <e> <s> therefore i am delighted that the great wisdom and experience of the forestry commission will be used in discussing operational plans which will make them attractive to the farmer and be environmentally acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that only a few years ago despite the protests of resident london civil servants we moved the forestry commission headquarters from savile row wi to edinburgh <e> <s> the comparative rents in savile row are now over per square foot <e> <s> in edinburgh they are between and per square foot <e> <s> would that not suggest that the example of the forestry commission might be copied by other government departments <e>", "<cs> my lords on the face of it i should like to support the proposition put forward on the question of valuation by the noble lords lord carmichael and lord morton of shuna <e> <s> i am sorry to say that despite the anger which was expressed in the columns of the <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a matter on which i have received representations from cosla and also the scottish federation of housing associations <e> <s> their concern in this matter has been expressed by the noble lord lord carmichael <e> <s> basically it is the difference between the eight years in the english bill as against five years in the scottish bill <e> <s> this is a case where i have argued for uniformity on a number of matters affecting scotland and england particularly as regards rating <e> <s> i now wish to have a degree of uniformity with the new legislation proposed for england <e> <s> both cosla and the national federation of housing associations are not opposed to the principle of a rolling cost floor but they are concerned about the timescale <e> <s> for local authorities for example the five-year rule will be an inadequate period for price increases to offset the remaining debt <e> <s> it may also inhibit local authorities from carrying out modernisation work or even new build projects if the possibility exists for tenants to buy these houses five years later with the full discount entitlement <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords who have spoken i should like to congratulate the minister on achieving this result <e> <s> it may be recalled that the question was aired at second reading <e> <s> most noble lords who are close to the scottish housing scene realised what an important contribution housing associations have made <e> <s> their contribution to community involvement has been invaluable <e> <s> it was wrong and unjust that they should suffer from any disqualification <e>", "<cs> i am tempted to intervene in this discussion only because i think i heard the minister say that key money or premiums were not a familiar feature of the scottish housing situation <e> <s> i must say that i disagree entirely with that point of view <e> <s> we discussed the matter on the scottish bill at very great length in this chamber <e> <s> the ministers noble friend lord sanderson resisted the abolition of the premium at an early stage but agreed to give it further consideration <e>", "<cs> when this matter was discussed in the chamber we made representations on the issue on the basis of the advice and briefing of shelter the national federation of housing associations and all the other organisations which were deeply concerned with scottish housing legislation <e> <s> it was on their representation that it was desirable to abolish key money that we managed to convince the ministers noble friend that it was desirable and an appropriate amendment was made <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to oppose the bill <e> <s> in fact i approve of it and i am supported in that view by the citizens of <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the total bill for timber imports into this country now runs at billion and that per cent <e> <s> of those imports are in softwoods conifers <e> <s> will he assure us that to avoid the problem which the noble lord lord vernon has raised this afternoon increased planting will take place in this country to ensure domestic supplies <e> <s> will he also take steps to monitor the impact of the abolition of tax incentives on the future of planting programmes <e>", "<cs> my lords since my name was associated with the amendments to which these amendments refer perhaps i may also express to the minister my appreciation of the consideration he has given to the case which was put in this house and to the concessions which are incorporated in the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords yesterday afternoon we had a long debate on the constitutional position of your lordships house and its general functions <e> <s> it is refreshing to be able to examine the last stages of a bill in which the house exercised its legitimate and useful function as a revising chamber <e> <s> i agree that the bill is an important one <e> <s> it deals with an immense social problem which affects many people and those who are least favoured in our community the homeless <e> <s> i congratulate the minister on piloting the bill through the house and on listening to the representations that were made and giving them serious consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the unfortunate consequences of this policy which have been described this afternoon will the minister make representations to his right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer and the department of trade and industry for direct credit controls as an alternative to this method of controlling inflation <e>", "<cs> at the risk of delaying good news may i also say that i have seen the figure <e>", "<cs> i was not present at second reading and therefore i do not know whether this subject was discussed at any length <e> <s> however i came here today duly briefed by various interested parties and i have listened to the arguments that have been put forward <e> <s> i must say that i am convinced by the logic of the ministers argument in this case <e> <s> we are trying to establish a national scheme by way of the bill which will be common to all areas with boards making an important contribution to parental involvement in the running of schools <e>", "<cs> it is a question of whether there should be a balance or whether there should be a majority of parental control <e> <s> this is a bill to involve parents more closely in the education system and i should be happy if the minister in his reply would try to allay some of the fears that have been expressed on this side of the committee with regard to the powers of the school board <e>", "<cs> one of the useful things that we have seen in the last few years has been the greater use of school facilities for further education <e> <s> perhaps i may say to the noble baroness lady carnegy that we are not talking about people who use the schools for the badminton club but of those involved in education and who are using the schools for community education <e> <s> with the increasing amount of leisure the increased number of adults who having left school a long time ago are making more use of schools is very much part of the schools environment <e> <s> they have an interest in the welfare of their schools <e> <s> that is a good thing <e> <s> i should have thought that it was sensible to provide for them in the amendment now before us <e>", "<cs> like other members of the committee who have listened to the debate this afternoon i sometimes pinch myself and ask whether we are not getting into too much detail in laying down the rules and regulations of this very interesting experiment <e> <s> but when i come to this matter i recall the dispute in the jordanhill school in glasgow where a headmaster has been dismissed and there are threats of legal action for all kinds of reasons for and against the governors on behalf of the parents on behalf of the headmaster and so on <e> <s> minutes have been demanded and public meetings have been held <e> <s> it appears to me therefore that a competent clerk is a rather important element in the set-up <e>", "<cs> will the noble earl permit me to interrupt <e> <s> i did not wish to discuss the issue <e> <s> my point was that what impressed me about that case was the need for a proper recording of events because of the possibility of litigation to which the noble earl has referred <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord carmichael may feel that he is satisfied with that reply <e> <s> if i may say so i felt that it was an admirable statement of the assessment that would be made of the attainment of the school <e> <s> it would not be an individual assessment and attainment would cover the whole field <e> <s> do not let us underestimate academic attainment in the schools as a measure of the progress <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will be receptive towards the amendment <e> <s> the proposal is not revolutionary but it lies at the heart of the matter <e> <s> the whole purpose of the bill is to ensure parent involvement <e> <s> it is not designed merely to set up boards to run the business and allow them to decide when to report back <e> <s> the purpose of the bill is to make the parent community feel that it is part of the process <e> <s> to that extent it is important that the board should not be the sole judge of when it appears right for it to report <e> <s> the board may think that it does not appear to it to be the right moment to report but it is a two-way business <e> <s> what do the electors think of its stewardship <e> <s> the board may think that matters are going smoothly and that it does not need a meeting but how do we test that <e> <s> we test it against the electors as parliamentary candidates do <e> <s> people have elected the boards and they will make their presence felt <e>", "<cs> many years ago when i was somewhat younger and slightly more revolutionary i moved in the education committee of glasgow corporation that there should be an annual holiday on st may each year as that was a day of great labour significance <e> <s> i was advised that the department of education laid down a certain number of attendance days every year for schools thoughout scotland <e> <s> if one took an extra days holiday for may day or for any other purpose one was required to replace it in order to ensure the maximum number of days attendance <e> <s> i wonder whether that is still the case and whether a local board making use of this facility for local holidays for tattie howkin the queens visit or some other purpose would have to sacrifice some other holiday <e> <s> is that the case <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister any information on the geographical distribution of unemployment <e> <s> is the level of unemployment in the north west north east and scotland just as great as it was before the general decline in unemployment took place <e>", "<cs> my lords we are at almost the final stages of this interesting and important bill <e> <s> from these benches we very much welcome the basic proposals on the school boards <e> <s> i regret very much that the educational institute of scotland which

in particular for single-parent families where mothers have to go out to work while their children are at school <e> <s> i therefore hope that in making any further contribution to this discussion on the future of education the eis will become less political more responsible and indulge in more constructive contributions to education than sloganising about the anglicisation of scottish education <e>", "<cs> my lords while the minister accepts that british aerospace was the winner in the bid is it not customary to put on a reserve price before disposal as the government appear to be doing in the case of the girobank <e> <s> would it not have been wise for the ministry to make a valuation of the sites based on planning applications being approved before it disposed of the assets <e>",

my two friends in this industry i could not help feeling that they were perhaps unduly alarmist about the prospect of losing their franchises <e> <s> at one stage i bid for a television franchise <e>

necessarily the final criterion and that the record of the proposed contractors and the quality of the programmes will be assessed <e>", "<cs> my lords i received the impression from the minister that that statement was qualified <e> <s> i am sure that he does not intend that the process will be simply that the bids will be submitted the envelopes opened and that the highest bid will get the

understood it <e> <s> i very much appreciate the ministers clear definition of how this process will be carried out so that very strict obligations will be put on the bidders as regards programme content balance and responsibility <e> <s> i would welcome confirmation from the minister of the point that i was going to make namely that it is easy to produce promises <e> <s> we should like

some kind of prospectus that is appealing <e> <s> what is important is the performance <e>", "<cs> my lords i was saying and i hope i am correct in this that promised continuity of franchises is not always a good thing <e> <s> it is an important discipline to companies that they have to <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the ministers reply may i take it that there is no danger of similar proceedings to those which took place on the privatisation of the trustee savings bank when the government laid claim to the assets which belonged to the members or the shareholders <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an interesting debate <e> <s> i cannot however congratulate the noble lord lord mountevans on his timing <e> <s> on the eve of the christmas recess a very thin house is discussing matters of great importance <e> <s> i should have thought that the subjects raised by the noble lord <e> <s> lord mountevans and the wider debate which has been opened by the noble lord lord ezra

i hope it will he taken on board at least on this occasion that both institutes are speaking with the same mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to have that clarification <e> <s> clause is sensible

taken place <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the substantial deterioration in the service of british telecom since privatisation will the minister give an assurance that he will not be tempted to follow a similar path with the post office <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in areas of high unemployment such as the city of glasgow there are many more young unemployed people in this age group than there are places available for them on yts <e> <s> as a result they suffer from a loss of financial support <e> <s> should the government not make it abundantly clear that no one should

witty and very wise speech <e> <s> his recent experience of dealing with small countries which have achieved self-government and independence will i am sure be useful in considering the subject we are

suggested drafting is of course a short version of section of the financial services act <e> <s> as has been pointed out the sib and the sros already have an immunity and it would appear to be inconsistent if that principle is not applied for the new supervisory bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister confirm that strathclyde region which represents a large part of scotland and is

repayment of their existing debts is consuming all their available resources <e> <s> can he say whether or not this country is supportive of the brady initiatives <e>", "<cs> my lords there appears to be some illogicality in retaining wales in the bill and excluding scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords my earlier question to the noble lord lord renton may have been misinterpreted as indicating i was anxious to include scotland in the bill <e> <s> i wish to assure the noble lord that we have no desire to be included in it <e> <s> any such suggestion would be greeted with great opposition and

assurance which he gave at the conclusion of his speech <e> <s> i felt that prior to his remarks we were getting off to a second reading debate on the quality of the bill as such <e> <s> that was

half the cost of the expected price of electricity from the pwr ordered by the cegb <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister comment on the impact of the poll tax for example on nurses who live in nursing hostels and who although generally exempt from rating impositions at the moment will pay the poll tax <e> <s> does the minister not agree that this will make the profession less attractive <e>", "<cs> is not trivial a somewhat subjective judgment <e> <s> what is trivial to the noble earl may not be trivial to me <e> <s> would it not be better to have clarification of the definition of trivial as suggested by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> like the noble lord lord peyton i feel that the minister should perhaps look at this <e> <s> this is not a party matter or a matter of principle <e>

lord is trying to be helpful to the government in seeking to have a clear definition of these responsibilities such as we should demand in any public company of this kind <e> <s> i hope that the minister will respond <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether we are perhaps moving into an entirely different area here <e> <s> i should have thought that some of the anxieties expressed by the noble lord lord williams of elvel are covered by existing oversight under the financial services act under the provisions of the office of fair trading and other organisations which take a lively interest in dubious

welfare if the minister were able to give us some assurance that the government recognise public sector obligations and that these would be taken on board in the new legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that despite the comment of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords is taking a percentage of the gdp a proper comparison of military expenditure since per cent <e> <s> of the gdp of the soviet union because of its lower standard of living represents a limited amount though an extremely high one whereas per cent <e> <s> of the gdp of the united states of america is a much greater sum <e>", "<cs> there is a substantial difference between us on the matter <e> <s> the protection of the consumer which has just been quoted refers to reasonable costs <e> <s> such reasonable costs can be very substantial <e> <s> however they are reasonable for the amount of contracting work involved <e> <s> therefore the costs will be justified <e> <s> but this is a very important question it concerns the protection of rural communities <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that with the opening of the torness power <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for confirming that the target is hectares per annum <e> <s> is he aware that the timber growers organisation the official organisation of treeplanting and timber growing has estimated that this years planting

and million small trees have been destroyed since there is no market from the nurseries <e> <s> does this indicate any assurance to the industry that the targets will be met <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that there was no question of crystal-gazing when i quoted the figure showing that over the past few weeks between million and million young trees have been destroyed in this country because there is no market for the nurseries <e> <s> is that not a scandal <e> <s> is it not clear evidence of the lack of acceptance that the hectare target will be met <e> <s> is the

alternatively are we again to be dependent on an adverse balance of payments and imports from sweden or the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a pleasure to follow the good common sense and practical contribution of the noble lord lord ezra <e> <s> i am in the fortunate position of being sandwiched between the excellent contribution to this debate of the noble lord lord ezra and the

unanimous chorus which supports the amendment <e> <s> at least it is unanimous until the minister speaks and i hope that he will not ignore the very considerable support which is evident <e> <s> in

declared <e> <s> i observed there a scottish nationalist marching with pipers to declare that she had succeeded in winning the only non-labour party seat in the whole of scotland <e> <s> every other seat had been won by the labour party and only that seat in the highlands was won by the scottish nationalists <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that this facility provides considerable assistance to british exporters particularly in heavy industry while at the same time to some extent discharging our aid obligation to third world countries <e> <s> in view of these circumstances and the fact that british contractors have to be competitive with other countries can he give some assurance that the government are likely to continue this facility at least in its present terms <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that this facility has generated orders to the extent of million for british contractors <e> <s> since many of those contracts involve long-term negotiations does he agree that it would be wise to make an early announcement in that regard so that the client countries as well as the companies competing for those contracts know where they stand <e>", "<cs> my lords when the minister is reviewing the european election results will he keep in mind that more than per cent <e> <s> of the people voted for minority parties in that election and have no representation whatever in the european parliament <e> <s> is it not a disgrace that this country alone among all the european nations does not observe proportional representation which would enable minority groups to have some voice in the european parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords may i have an assurance from the minister that the principle of not one of us has not been applied in various appointments to regional health boards throughout the country <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that prestwick is an excellent but underused international airport <e> <s> is he aware that it is within miles of the city of glasgow which means that it is closer to glasgow than gatwick is to london <e> <s> does he accept that a large number of people in the west of scotland find it environmentally unacceptable to have additional transatlantic flights from a city centre airport <e>", "<cs> my lords the presence of the noble lord lord sanderson of bowden on <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the noble lord this question <e> <s> the statistics that he quoted relate to shops and supermarkets <e> <s> in the bill are shops included or just supermarkets <e>", "<cs> my lords

publics water <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that my question was prompted by the concern expressed in scotland that some of that land will be sold to be used as sporting estates from which the public will inevitably be excluded <e> <s> is he not concerned about that <e> <s> is he aware that his statement about the necessity of maintaining wood production will be very much welcomed in scotland <e> <s> however how will he reconcile that with the fact that the governments planting target is hectares and that total planting of new wood-lands this year will be hectares <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that when the matter was raised in connection with an amendment to the water bill the noble earl lord arran said that to limit coniferous planting in these areas was going too far <e> <s> will he also confirm that our total import bill for timber and timber products is billion per annum <e> <s> will he also confirm that this country is the least afforested country

what we have before us is as he said a new bill introduced at report stage of the local government and housing bill <e> <s> to that extent the house is indebted to the noble lord for denouncing the provisions of what is disguised as an amendment but which introduces new principles into an act namely the poll tax legislation which we have already disposed of <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i said to the noble lord that rates arrears tend to accumulate at this time but it indicates that the new revolution in taxation in which it is claimed that the people will feel more responsible for local

assurance from the government that as a result of that review british industry and in particular heavy industry and the plant manufacturing industry which makes a remarkable contribution to our export activities will not be disadvantaged against its competitors by any damaging change in the provisions of the ecgd <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the question indicates another anomaly in this most unpopular measure <e> <s> is he aware that in todays press the scottish banks have advised the secretary of state for scotland that they find it impossible to operate the hundreds of thousands of arrestment notices which have been lodged against non-payment of the tax <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the relationship between the central bank and the government is a very delicate one and that it depends substantially on who occupies the important post of governor of the bank of england <e> <s> may i have an assurance that in any subsequent appointments to that great and important position a distinguished banker with experience in that field would be a candidate but not necessarily with political ties <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to ask the leader of the house a question <e> <s> what is the method by which a two-and-a-half-hour debate is allocated <e> <s> could it not have been anticipated that the matter raised by the noble lord lord callaghan would

north-east schools are being closed <e> <s> is that not a reflection of the inadequacy of a regional policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am moved to participate in the debate tonight for a variety of reasons <e> <s> i had my first business experience as an employee of the co-operative movement <e> <s> like the noble lord lord graham of edmonton i was rewarded in due course with the highest honour that the co-operative movement can award <e> <s> i became chairman of the co-operative congress <e> <s> therefore i share with the noble lord lord graham a sense of dismay and disappointment at the proposals which are now before us <e> <s> i understand that it is within the conventions of this house that we do not vote against the proposals although i feel inclined to do so <e> <s> in the house of commons the vote on this proposal was to which suggests that we might be tempted to proceed with a vote in this house and give the house of commons another opportunity to review its decision <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that one method of relieving the pressure on overseas forests is to encourage domestic forestry <e> <s> is he aware that this countrys total bill for imported forest products is now billion per annum while our planting programme is falling far short of the governments target <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that it is extremely difficult to compare one rating system with another <e> <s> will he confirm that the number of summary warrants issued in scotland to non-payers of a tax which came into existence in april last year is <e> <s> is he further aware that in the city of glasgow per cent <e> <s> of those liable to pay the tax have not paid it <e> <s> can he tell me how he proposes to collect that tax in view of the fact that the scottish banks have indicated that they are unable to handle the number of arrestment notices <e>", "<cs> my lords since i am the guilty party because i asked the question perhaps i may assure the noble lord that it is no part of the policy of the social democratic party and i am sure that i may speak for the liberals in this respect to encourage people not to pay the tax <e> <s> however in view of the figure given of summary warrants issued to individuals is the minister aware that it not only represents a socially unjust tax but as suggested by the noble lord lord carmichael also an administrative nightmare <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has given the house an impressive list of various initiatives <e> <s> however perhaps he will confirm that they are not in fact working <e> <s> is he aware that young people emigrated from scotland to the south last year as against in the year <e> <s> the national institute of social and economic research says that between now and the year there will be a growth in the south-east of per cent <e> <s> as against per cent <e> <s> in the scottish region <e> <s> when will the government take stock of whether their regional policies are working <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that europe was saved from chaos at the end of the war by the imaginative scheme of the marshall plan and that this country contributed per cent <e> <s> of its gdp to assist european countries less fortunate than ourselves <e> <s> can he give us any hope that a similar imaginative plan will be agreed between us and our allies in order to take advantage of the tremendous change which is taking place in eastern europe <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the assurance that old people will be taken care of and funds made available <e> <s> will that be in any way influenced by the desire of the government to put a limit on local authority spending <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say what the logic is of putting at the end of the queue the privatisation of the scottish electricity industry when it is a relatively simple operation of two integrated companies compared with the complicated business of the whole industry south of the border <e> <s> has he seen the comment of the chairman of the south of scotland electricity board who said that early birds get the best investment opportunities <e> <s> there is a limited amount of investment available in the industry <e> <s> why should the scottish one be relegated to the end of the queue <e>", "<cs> my lords i declare an interest in that i am associated with a responsible opencast operator <e> <s> i can assure noble lords that it is much concerned that the amenity aspects of its operations are strictly observed <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not an inconsistency in that for good social reasons the price of unleaded petrol is cheaper than that of leaded petrol and yet in the case of beer the price of non-alcoholic beer is dearer than the price of alcoholic beer <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for that helpful reply and congratulate our representative in colombo on the stand he has taken on the question of human rights <e> <s> however has the ministers attention been drawn to a recent article in the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the major aid donors to sri lanka that is germany holland canada and sweden recently met and asked the sri lankan government for some improvement in this situation as otherwise it may affect aid contributions from those countries <e> <s> are the british government part of those representations <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the minister aware that the bank of england has on a number of occasions recently threatened to withdraw the banking licence from certain reputable banks operating in this country <e> <s> does he not consider that there is a case for looking seriously at taking similar action in connection with this bank <e>", "<cs> i wish to add my support for the purposes of the amendment <e> <s> i have been a trustee of at least two charities in scotland and believe that people who know their way around can generally find the appropriate charities to support their interest <e> <s> however the people who are perhaps <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister endeavouring to bring into harmony all such legislation between scotland and england <e> <s> further will he say that any changes in english legislation will be retrospective in their application in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that members of scottish regiments including the black watch on being returned to their barracks during the past year have been liable to poll tax <e> <s> that is one year in advance of any other member of her majestys forces <e> <s> is not that another injustice <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an anniversary <e> <s> i am sorry that the late lord ross of marnock is not here to listen to the debate <e> <s> it is almost three years to the day since this tax was introduced into the house by the noble lord lord glenarthur <e> <s> he said at col of the <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister say when we last had a deficit in our invisibles and confirm that it is an alarming trend <e> <s> does it affect the standing of the city of london as an international finance centre <e> <s> if so is that caused by our isolation from the european financial institutions <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that one of the important areas of rural employment in scotland is forestry <e> <s> is he further aware that the target for uk forestry established by the government is around hectares <e> <s> the figures for last year reveal that the planting programme is now only hectares <e> <s> does the minister not agree that this is a matter of considerable concern <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in his statement which dealt with this matter the noble lords right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer said that he had forgotten all about scotland <e> <s> this has caused considerable resentment in scotland <e> <s> the governments rating in the latest opinion poll has now dropped to per cent <e> <s> not per cent <e> <s> in scotland <e> <s> can the minister give an assurance that any further refinements or concessions on poll tax legislation in england and wales will automatically <e>", "<cs> my lords in replying to such questions in future will the minister be less selective in the statistics he gives on non-payment <e> <s> he referred to per cent <e> <s> payment in the borders <e> <s> there are more sheep in the borders than people <e> <s> will he give the figures for the strathclyde region <e> <s> does he accept that per cent <e> <s> of the population of glasgow have so far not paid and that <e>", "<cs> my lord in replying to that question can the minister say whether rate capping will in any way limit the new responsibilities that local authorities will assume for caring for the mentally ill and other people who become their responsibility after the bill becomes law <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my first duty to congratulate the noble earl lord carlisle on his interesting and challenging maiden speech <e> <s> i am certain that speakers who follow me will respond to his challenging remarks <e> <s> in all fairness and charity i must say that his experience of the activities of the forestry commission is at great variance with mine <e> <s> i assume that that is also true of other ex-chairmen of the commission who are present in the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house will be encouraged by the figures which have been given this afternoon <e> <s> will the minister tell us what are the anticipated revenues to the state from that massive investment and whether those revenues will be used to encourage manufacturing industry or infrastructure development instead of being dissipated <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that problems which arise as a result of there being users of the countryside other than birds must also be taken into account <e> <s> will he commend the decentralisation of the nature conservancy council in order to ensure that there is a local and intimate knowledge of all the factors in designating <e> <s> will he also pay compliment to the forestry commission for protecting the osprey and i hope the capercaillie and other rare species in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that lurchers gully is an important development for skiing and tourism in general and that the interests of the local population should not be lost sight of in the event of any designation taking place <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of a survey by the forestry commission in the north of scotland which is the habitat of this magnificent bird and that a decline in the numbers of birds there was observed <e> <s> is he further aware that the forestry commission imposed a ban on any forestry commission shooting of those birds <e> <s> the birds are not shot for eating but simply as trophies for some of our european friends who come over to shoot in scotland <e> <s> would the minister encourage the government to follow the lead of the forestry commission which is given little credit for what it does in this field <e> <s> would he also encourage the government to impose a similar ban throughout private woodlands as well as on forestry commission properties <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure to follow the noble lord lord pennock in his reassuring and encouraging statement on the prospects for the channel tunnel <e> <s> i very much regret that my noble friend lord jay is not in his seat because i think that his has been the only dissenting voice in the debate so far <e> <s> i believe that he made one or two departures from his normal logic <e> <s> first he based the assumptions of the channel tunnel traffic on a switch from the cross-channel shipping services <e> <s> i believe that he excludes and underestimates the substantial growth in total traffic which will take place as a result of the new relationships with europe <e>", "<cs> i shall welcome the ministers statement if the provision covers all disabilities including mental disability <e> <s> if that assurance is given i shall be happy with the statement <e>", "<cs> like other members of the committee i received the same brief as that provided to my noble friend lord carmichael <e> <s> i do not propose to read it again but i wish to give additional authority <e> <s> the amendment has been prepared by the care in the community scottish working group to which i am reasonably close <e> <s> it is largely a voluntary organisation concerned with care in scotland <e> <s> i can vouch for the fact that it is deeply concerned about the matter and has no political axe to grind <e> <s> i am chairman of the scottish action group on dementia which is associated with alzheimers disease in scotland and deeply involved in mental health care <e> <s> on reading the brief provided the case appears to be self-evident <e> <s> i hope that the minister will respond to the concern <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord carmichael made a very telling point when he said that there are already examples of the system of dual registration enabling homes to avoid providing high quality services <e> <s> some establishments which would have been refused registration by the local authority as residential homes because they failed to meet current standards have succeeded in being registered as nursing homes <e> <s> that is one of the problems which the noble lord lord carmichael was anxious to emphasise <e> <s> i wonder whether the ministers reply really touched that problem <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i wish to express my debt to the noble lord lord moran for drawing our attention to this important problem <e> <s> he will not be surprised to discover that i cannot follow him in some of the propositions he made in the course of his submissions this evening <e>", "<cs> shame my lords <e> <s> if the noble lord lived in islay he would not call shame <e>", "<cs> i know that but people in ireland also have an interest in peat <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has already stated his case and has made that point <e> <s> with all due respect i presume he knows the flow country <e> <s> the secretary of state for scotland quite rightly said that there is sufficient land in the flow country to protect the concerns of the noble lord lord moran and other environmentalists and at the same time provide a degree of economic activity in which people will be able to earn their living <e>", "<cs> my lords with due respect the noble lord lord moran said that he wants the whole of the flow country designated as a <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that hectares of scotland have now been designated as protected areas <e> <s> that virtually sterilises the hectares and there is no appeal <e> <s> is he further aware that this is causing great concern in scotland and emphasises the need for the administration of such matters to be in scottish hands <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but i must ask him whether he is speaking for the liberal party officially <e> <s> is he aware that the scottish liberal members opposed this view and that his party in the house of commons supported the governments scheme of decentralisation in the field <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords will be delighted to know that my train goes in about minutes <e> <s> those noble lords who have to travel seven hours to reach this house do not appreciate business of great importance to scotland being taken on friday afternoon <e> <s> i notice that the bill seriously affects scotland and in particular the provision for the future of the nature conservancy council <e> <s> i think that only two of my colleagues from the scottish peers association are able to be present this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i am speaking as an individual in this regard <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will permit me to proceed <e> <s> there has been a suggestion that such a device will minimise or reduce the power or influence of the nature conservancy council <e> <s> i do not often speak in support of the government <e> <s> however they are to be commended with regard to the nature conservancy council <e> <s> the expenditure on the nature conservancy council in the past five years in grant and aid has increased from million to million last year <e> <s> that suggests that the government are not intent as has been suggested in another place in some way to diminish the nature conservancy council <e> <s> i believe that the governments proposals are aimed at making the council more effective more democratic and more acceptable to the people who are affected by its decisions <e> <s> having said those few words i shall run for my train <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite sure that the labour party is committed to a policy of devolution <e> <s> however perhaps we should see how far we can apply those devolution devices with regard to the nature conservancy council and the countryside commission <e>", "<cs> my lords the question refers specifically to the shetland fishery but do similar problems apply in the estuaries of other rivers in scotland and what restrictions are imposed in other areas beyond shetland <e>", "<cs> my lords since the nuclear stations will be decommissioned at a cost of billion can the noble viscount say over what period that will be spread <e> <s> will he also say if the nuclear industry is being taken out of the privatisation provisions for the electricity industry whether the billion will fall to the taxpayer <e>", "<cs> my lords for the purposes of further debate in which regional policy will feature i ask the noble lord how many of the consultancies were taken up in the south east and how many in the regions <e>", "<cs> my lords i propose this afternoon to say something about regional policy which is within the remit and responsibility of the dti <e> <s> before doing so i should like an answer to one or two specific points and i am sure that the minister will give me the necessary reply in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister expect a reduction in the amount of junk mail following the very unwelcome news in todays newspapers that postal charges are to be substantially increased <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> however does he recall the statement made by the department of trade and industry in its white paper that <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government and the minister accept that per cent <e> <s> of government-funded research and development is in the defence industries as against per cent <e> <s> in germany and per cent <e> <s> in japan <e> <s> does not the new defence policy offer the opportunity to return scientists to civilian manufacturing <e>", "<cs> i apologise to my noble friend for being absent at the beginning of the debate <e> <s> i was upstairs attending a meeting of great importance to scotland concerning the environmental protection bill which we shall debate tomorrow <e> <s> i support the case which my noble friend presented <e> <s> as my noble friend lord hughes said when the subject was discussed in committee in another place mr ian lang the minister said <e>", "<cs> will the noble baroness speak a little louder or move nearer to the microphone <e> <s> we are anxious to hear her <e>", "<cs> i have much sympathy for what my noble friend lord carmichael said <e> <s> however at the same time i have some doubts about his amendment <e> <s> in my view it is a little wide of the mark <e> <s> we are talking about training and enterprise initiatives <e> <s> it offers very wide scope if one speaks of all organisations <e>", "<cs> in an earlier discussion we spoke of transferring assets from the new towns <e> <s> i felt that the noble lord lord carmichael made very pertinent points <e> <s> however we are now discussing an even more important matter not the transfer of assets but of peoples homes <e> <s> it is a very intimate and important aspect of the life of the community <e>", "<cs> i have already spoken to this amendment <e> <s> i did so when we discussed amendment no <e> <s> and i have nothing to add <e> <s> i apologise to the committee and to the mover of the amendment for speaking to this amendment when we were discussing the disposal of assets <e> <s> i can only add my voice and any persuasive powers which i have in support of this very reasonable amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the minister just one question <e> <s> can he tell me what the english legislation says <e> <s> i understand from the noble baroness lady stedman that in her area a ballot is taking place among tenants in the new town which is being wound up as to whether they wish to become tenants of the local authority the district council housing associations or otherwise <e> <s> i wonder if there is any inconsistency in the legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister seen the fraser of allander analysis of the consequences of regional policy in which it is stated that the new policy is wrong in principle and damaging in practice <e> <s> can the governments commitment to regional policy be reconciled with the fact that the london docklands development corporations state funding for this year is substantially more than the entire regional development assistance to the scottish development agency <e>", "<cs> the case submitted today by the noble earl lord onslow is not only inappropriate as the noble baroness lady carnegy suggested but i regard it as insulting <e> <s> there is an implication that the scots are not concerned about conservation and cannot be trusted to look after their own affairs in that field <e> <s> i regard that as insulting and it is to tally wrong <e>", "<cs> one of the jewels in my crown is that i moved the forestry commission headquarters from savile row where it was when i became chairman to edinburgh <e> <s> the first question i asked was where is the planting taking place <e> <s> i found that per cent <e> <s> of all new planting was taking place in scotland <e> <s> i said that that is where the headquarters should be <e> <s> by the same token in view of the substantial impact of the activities of the nature conservancy council in scotland i suggest that the nearer we get to the ground the better <e>", "<cs> can the noble earl indicate how much of the flow country is planted and how much remains for the birds <e>", "<cs> it is per cent <e> <s> of the area of scotland <e>", "<cs> will the ministry of agriculture and fisheries draw attention to such matters as it did in that case <e>", "<cs> if the amendment is pressed to a division i shall support it because of its intention <e> <s> like the noble lord lord rochester i am opposed to <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the cost of any such new arrangements for london transport is immense and that it might be more sensible socially and economically if a much more aggressive regional policy were followed in order to decentralise government and industrial activity <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in his memoirs which i commend to him a former chancellor of the exchequer said that such is the quality of statistics that when he asked the economists in his department for a telephone number they gave him an estimate <e>", "<cs> my lords while i am not against the consumer paying the market price for petroleum do the government consider that it may be <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment which has just been moved <e> <s> i speak as a former director of scottish television <e> <s> in the television organisations there is a danger of centralisation and domination of the market by the five major companies <e> <s> it is vital to the liveliness of television as well as to the stimulation of regional culture that there should be some recognition of the importance of the input from the regional companies <e> <s> i hope that there will be some provision in the bill to maintain that balance <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the agreement that exports are essential to this country can the minister give the house a guarantee that any new arrangements which are proposed by the export credit guarantee department will not put british exporters at a disadvantage against their competitors <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not pretend to defend the governments handling of this matter but since my name has been mentioned by the noble lord lord ross of newport i think i should say a word or two <e> <s> i support the government in their intention and i hope that the provisions of the bill will be implemented <e> <s> it is an exercise in devolution of authority to scotland so that we can have a much more sensitive approach to some of the difficult areas of land use and environment not from peterborough but on the ground <e> <s> it is not sufficient for the noble lord lord ross whose colleagues in another place supported this measure to say that ballots of the staff at peterborough and of the small staff in scotland were taken and that by a large majority they voted against this measure <e>", "<cs> my lords it is being said that chaos will be brought about but quite frankly this is a rearguard action by people who are opposed to part vii of the bill <e> <s> i must compliment the opponents from all sides on their efficiency <e> <s> they have written letters to <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that i was critical of the handling of the bill but that i supported the principle behind it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the leader of the house accept that the question is not designed to reflect on the parliamentary under-secretary who will answer for these affairs in this house and whose grandfather answered similarly in <e> <s> however is the minister aware that since january successive governments have had a minister of state for scottish affairs answerable to this house <e> <s> does he accept that the transfer of the noble lord lord sanderson i am delighted to see the <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that diminishing the status of this important position in the house of lords is causing some dismay in scotland <e> <s> it is generally regarded that the prime minister is totally insensitive to the needs of scotland and has already written it off in electoral terms <e>"]
