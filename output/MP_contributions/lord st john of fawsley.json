["<cs> my lords perhaps i may preface my few words this afternoon with two observations of a personal character <e> <s> first i should like to express my appreciation of the warmth of the welcome your lordships have extended to me since i was translated to this house two months ago <e> <s> i had heard of the friendliness of this house i have now experienced it for myself <e> <s> i should also like to express my appreciation to the staff of this house for their concerned help which has enabled me not only to stand upon my own feet but also to avoid unnecessarily treading on the feet of other people <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the design of this hideous pier has been before the royal fine art commission in which i should declare my interest as chairman for months <e> <s> we have found it totally unacceptable <e> <s> will the minister even after what he has said use his influence with the secretary of state for the environment so that we can get a pier there which will respect and not destroy one of the most beautiful views in the kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that at a time of declining church attendance it is all the more important for children to experience a public act of worship corporately together <e> <s> does she further agree that trying to teach re and leaving out the act of worship is like trying to teach astronomy and leaving out the stars <e> <s> what action is her ministry taking to ensure that these acts of worship are indeed acts of worship and not seminars on current affairs <e>", "<cs> my lords does not my noble friend agree that the supplementary question of the noble baroness to whom we naturally listened with the greatest of respect has really been rather overtaken by events <e> <s> does he not agree that we owe a debt of gratitude to my right honourable friend the secretary of state for northern ireland for the vigorous action taken earlier this week in appointing two inquiries into the stalker affair <e> <s> does he agree that without that statesmanlike act and the admirable restraint shown by mr haughey we should be in danger of ending up by alienating both of the communities in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that disposing of works of art which are temporarily out of favour may or may not be a betrayal of the people who have left them as legacies but could be a very bad commercial judgment <e> <s> if our museums and galleries had sold off victorian pictures a few decades ago we would have lost some of the finest pictures in our collection today <e> <s> does he realise that at one time even the mona lisa might have been obtained for a song <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support what the noble lord said <e> <s> is it not right that the best and most immediate solution to the litter problem would be on-the-spot fines for anyone dropping litter in the street <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in response to strong representations from the royal fine art commission the city of london has promised to take the necessary measures to preserve these important remains temporarily <e> <s> however is not the present problem that of permanently preserving this unique piece of architecture for future generations <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support what the noble lord lord airedale has said about incorporating a general principle into the law on this matter binding trustees <e> <s> is it not a case as my noble and learned friend lord hailsham might put it of <e>", "<cs> my lords with reference to what my noble friend lord carr of hadley said about good intentions leading to an unmentionable place is it not true that the government are leading people into a perfectly mentionable place hitherto unknown to the law namely limbo <e> <s> does that action not have grave legal consequences since it is an innovation unknown to our common law <e>", "<cs> my lords could not the government themselves acquire the site <e> <s> could not the minister persuade the government to move his own department out of the present buildings in marsham street thus enabling one of the most hideous structures in london and indeed in the kingdom to be demolished <e> <s> in any case can he give the house an assurance that whoever acquires the building the great ceremonial rooms and ceremonial hall will be preserved <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the royal fine art commission is now under entirely new management <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend realise that many people are grateful to the secretary of state for exercising economy of listing in the buildings put up in the years from the beginning of the war <e> <s> with regard to the alleged remark of my noble friend is it not true to say that in architectural matters the public judgment is very often better than that of the experts and if it had been listened to more often we should have had rather better architecture today than we have <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord lord alexander of potterhill is not in his place <e> <s> i hope that he is not indisposed <e> <s> he is one of the great figures in the education world <e> <s> i care for him particularly because when i became a minister for the first time more years ago than i care to remember he took me out for my first free lunch <e> <s> i mean my first free lunch as a minister i had been taken out to lunch before that <e> <s> however despite his absence being educations loss it is my gain as i have moved up from th to th speaker on second reading and that is something <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the vast majority of speeches <e> <s> they have been very good well worth listening to and rather better than the ones to which i was accustomed in the commons <e>", "<cs> my lords may i presume to congratulate my noble friend on adding the arts to agriculture in her list of responsibilities in this house <e> <s> perhaps i may ask her whether she is aware that unfortunately last week one of the most scandalous acts ever perpetrated by an institution of higher learning took place when manchester university sold rare books from the rylands collection contrary to the express wishes of the original owners <e> <s> in view of what the minister has said about export can she ensure that these treasures are not exported and lost to this country <e> <s> in future before such sales take place would it be possible for an inquiry to be held conducted by an independent group of scholars other than those concerned in the sale and dispersal of such a collection <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that helpful and constructive reply <e> <s> will she consider giving trustee status to the horniman museum so that it may be both nationally and privately funded <e> <s> will she consider the making of the geffrye museum an outstation of the museum of london <e> <s> is she aware that her helpful reply today has done much to allay the doubts of those who fully support government education policy but are nervous about the effect of the abolition of ilea on the arts which to be fair to ilea is one of the matters it handled well <e>", "<cs> i rise to join in the support which has been given to the right reverend prelate in moving this extremely valuable and important amendment <e> <s> religious education is given a primacy in this bill by this amendment which i certainly welcome <e> <s> while one welcomes a primacy as the most reverend primate the archbishop of canterbury will recognise a primacy is not without its ambiguities <e> <s> one wonders what exactly the relationship is between the basic curriculum the core curriculum and the foundation subjects <e> <s> what are the sanctions and consequences of each <e> <s> it would perhaps require a mind of jesuitical complexity fully to fathom these relationships <e> <s> one would welcome some clarification from the right reverend prelate when he speaks at the end of this short debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that partially encouraging answer <e> <s> is she aware of the great anxiety that has been caused by press reports stating that the new building is not to be completed but is to be scrapped at some stage <e> <s> can she reiterate that it remains government policy that all parts of the british library will be accommodated in one building and under one roof <e> <s> can she also bring us up to date as to the future of the reading room at the british museum because to lose that room and not gain a unified building will be to have the worst of all worlds <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for troubling my noble friend further but she let slip a word about new designs <e> <s> if there are to be new designs for this building perhaps i may humbly request that the royal fine art commission has the opportunity to look at them <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may add a footnote to what has been said <e> <s> i am in the happy position of agreeing entirely with what everybody has said in this short debate <e> <s> all members of the committee who have spoken seem basically to be on the same side but have a slightly different means of approaching the matter <e> <s> i should like to say how grateful i am and i am sure many other members of your lordships house are to the noble baroness lady cox and others for their sheer persistence in this matter <e> <s> they are as it were the grit in the oyster which we trust will in the end produce the right reverend prelates pearl <e>", "<cs> it gives me great pleasure to support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord birkett <e> <s> it is fitting that this amendment should be moved by a cross-bencher since it is one that commands support from every part of this chamber <e> <s> i am especially pleased to support the noble lord since i had the privilege of knowing his father who was as distinguished for his love of the arts and literature in particular as he was renowned in the practice of the law <e>", "<cs> although that sentiment does not seem to command universal consent it is one which i sincerely feel <e> <s> we should have been in much more difficulty with this bill had it not been for that approach <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that irrespective of any views which may be held on the ec there is widespread dismay at the prospect of losing the traditional blue format of british passports in favour of a limp vermilion mini-version <e> <s> since the home office maintains that there is no such thing as a european passport and since <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend agree with regard to the <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not agree that it is wholly regrettable to separate national holidays from the religious events which originally gave rise to them <e> <s> is it not the case in this instance that whitsun one of the greatest feasts of the church has virtually vanished from the public consciousness <e> <s> since this is a government who wish to promote morality would it not assist if they gave public recognition to the religion on which that morality is based <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> is she aware that there is widespread anxiety in the university world about the reduction in public funding <e> <s> is she further aware that in oxford posts have been abolished and academic posts have been suspended <e> <s> can she hold out any hope of an improvement in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that one needs only one attribute to be a good teacher and that is to have a teaching nature <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say first what an extraordinary privilege it is for anyone with an historical sense to be taking part in this debate <e> <s> the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby referred to the education act <e> <s> the debate has been going on for long before that <e> <s> it goes hack to the cowper temple clause in the s <e> <s> but i believe that what is remarkable about this debate as opposed to some of the debates in the past is that although people have spoken with passion no one has spoken with any bitterness <e> <s> that is an extraordinary transformation <e>", "<cs> it would explode <e> <s> but one has to consider not the outstanding individual hut the ordinary child in a school <e> <s> one cannot teach morality effectively to the ordinary child unless there is some higher sanction behind it <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the royal parks have lost more than trees and that the prince of wales appeal has raised which will replace one-fifth of those trees <e> <s> will my noble friend say that the government will supplement the clearing up grant with a matching replanting grant so that those parks which mean so much to the nation can soon recover their former beauty <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for what she has said <e> <s> i do not know whether to be gratified or dismayed by the <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not expect to stir the dying embers of the noble lord lord peston into flame <e> <s> however it is something to have achieved that <e> <s> i have been assailed on both sides <e> <s> on one side i have been assailed by the noble lord lord taylor of blackburn for stating the obvious and for repeating what is already in practice and already there <e> <s> on the other side my noble friend lord beloff attacks me for introducing a revolutionary idea at a late stage of the bill <e> <s> well who is to judge between those two titans <e> <s> i draw the conclusion that perhaps if they are both united in opposing my amendment it is probably more or less right <e> <s> other conclusions are certainly open to noble lords to draw for themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may follow the example of other noble lords and speak very briefly at this final stage of the debate <e> <s> i support what my noble friend lord elton has said in response to the noble lord on the opposition front bench who asks why the government have changed their mind on the issue <e> <s> it is because they have listened to the argument in this house yes certainly this house <e> <s> it is here that we get argument in our parliamentary system that is audible and intelligible <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for the amendment that she has tabled on behalf of the government <e> <s> i am gratified that my little mouse of an amendment which was moved at report stage has been transformed into a mountain by the technical efficiency with which the present amendment has been drafted <e> <s> thanks to my noble friend it has become the mouse that roared <e> <s> it is a transformation scene for which i am grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord would give way <e> <s> it was indeed a pyrotechnic display <e> <s> it was like seeing an extinct volcano suddenly erupt <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend realise that the british film industry is now facing the greatest financial crisis in the whole of its history <e> <s> unless something is done we shall soon wake up and find that there is no british film industry at all able to take advantage of the opportunities to which my noble friend referred <e> <s> does he understand that the film has now become a major art form particularly for young people and that it gains for us prestige throughout the world <e> <s> will the government look again at the most crucial economic matter which is the provision of initial development grants for the film industry such as are enjoyed in other european countries and which the industry must have if it is to survive <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that i fully support the government policy of rolling back the frontiers of the state <e> <s> unless one is a nineteenth century liberal there must be areas where the state rightly exercises influence and intervenes <e> <s> one such area is a crucial industry that is facing this threat and the loss of which would be a major national disaster <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend will accept congratulations to the government for this bold attempt <e> <s> however will she bear in mind if i may dare to use an agricultural metaphor that it could turn out to be a mares nest <e> <s> if unfortunately it does so will she ensure that the money is devoted to other arts projects however large the sum may be and principally to the royal opera house the national theatre and the royal fine arts commission <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend agree that the prime responsibility for what one can only call an act of cultural vandalism rests not upon the government but upon ken livingstones glc and the succeeding residuary body <e> <s> would it not be a splendid thing if the government like a white knight came to the rescue <e>", "<cs> and saved the noble and learned lord lord hailsham and saved one of our oldest theatrical institutions <e> <s> will my noble friend use his considerable charm and powers of persuasion to ask the secretary of state to intervene and act in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend perhaps tell us why the noble lord lord dean is attacking the noble lord lord jenkins since he is no longer a member of the labour party <e>", "<cs> my lords i too thank my noble friend for that encouraging reply <e> <s> is he aware that president ceausescu having ordered the destruction of large parts of historic bucharest is now intent on destroying cemeteries houses and churches which form a large part of our european heritage in transylvania <e> <s> can some further action be taken possibly through the united nations to call a halt to that career of vandalism <e>", "<cs> my lords does not my noble friend agree that what is important as regards this building is not its use but the preservation of its architectural features and its ceremonial rooms <e> <s> in view of the record of the london residuary body in <e>", "<cs> my lords does not this discussion show the wisdom of following the advice of lord melbourne why cant you let the matter alone <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that encouraging reply <e> <s> but does she not agree that it is a flagrant breach of trust to offer a map which is part of the national heritage in general and that of hereford in particular for sale at public auction <e> <s> will the government act swiftly in this matter by raising the money in conjunction with the noble lord lord charteris of amisfield to make sure that the sale does not take place <e> <s> in the long run is not the solution to this problem to recognise that our cathedrals are national treasures which should be supported by the nation <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend accept that what has emerged from these exchanges is a very welcome determination from herself to do everything that she can to save the map for the nation <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware of the important report published today by that most influential select committee in another place namely the public accounts committee which describes the conservation and storage situation in our national galleries and museums as a national disaster <e> <s> would it not be a fitting way to mark museums year if the government could initiate a major programme to quantify the problem and above all to improve the standards of training for conservation <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that i am marginally grateful for that reply <e> <s> will he bear in mind that beauty is not only in the eye of the beholder it is an attribute of the deity <e> <s> does he agree that most people think that chartres cathedral for example is superior to a pre-fabricated bungalow <e> <s> pending divine illumination will he encourage local authorities to issue guidelines on questions such as the bulk scale massing and context of buildings within their area <e> <s> will he encourage them to appoint local panels along the lines of the fine art commission to advise them in such matters <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the british theatre is not only the brightest jewel in our cultural crown but it is also a major earner of foreign currency <e> <s> so what justification can there be for a candle-end economy in stopping a grant of to an essential theatrical resource <e> <s> will my noble friend get the government to change course on this matter and get them to provide a permanent home for this unique collection <e> <s> if that is not done the collection will next month find itself on the streets <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may join in the bidding for this somewhat hypothetical sum <e> <s> is my noble friend aware of the project of the royal fine art commission called learning to see which is intended to raise standards of visual appreciation and education in our schools which is the only way to ensure good contemporary architecture <e> <s> since he is a generous and benevolent person himself with his own money will he pass on those qualities to his governmental colleagues and see whether we can have some public money for an important project which is at the moment totally privately financed <e>", "<cs> my lords following the important question of the noble baroness does this report cover quails eggs <e> <s> the consumption of quails eggs though by a minority is very considerable <e> <s> is there a danger from them as well <e>", "<cs> my lords thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that the royal fine art commission is reasonably content with the treatment of county hall but is deeply disturbed by the inclusion in the development of a monstrous white elephant of an office building which will by its bulk and height dominate scotts riverside building and will cast a giant shadow in front of it <e> <s> in view of the importance of the site to the capital and to the nation will my noble friend persuade his right <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend who has so kindly said that he will intervene with the secretary of state for the environment on the question of the office building also draw to his attention the fact that the rest of the south bank site is being developed and that it is essential for aesthetic reasons that the development of the county hall site and the rest of the south bank site be co-ordinated <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that many people will support the noble lord lord annan in his fears for the destruction of that historic part of london <e> <s> can the minister assure the house that keystone crescent which is as fine a crescent as pelham crescent will not be destroyed because that is my understanding <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask a friendly question from next door <e> <s> is it the case that under these arrangements the prime minister has a discretion to alter the order of names as received from the church and does her majesty enjoy the same discretion <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that interim answer <e> <s> does he not think that this is a case where the government should make their views known clearly and at once <e> <s> does he not realise that british rail is proposing an act of vandalism to sweep away acres of good housing shops small businesses and offices which constitute a real community not yuppiedom but a real rooted working class community <e> <s> is not the existence of such communities what living in a city is all about <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that instead of being so obsessed with the purity of our water supply those countries would be better employed seeking to improve the quality of their wine supply <e>", "<cs> my lords as the lower house is now externally in pristine sparkling form is it not fitting that the house which is first in dignity should not lag behind like a dowdy dowager but should be speedily restored to its youthful splendour <e> <s> can the minister assure the house that the commercialisation of the psa welcome as it is will not delay this further <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that these curmudgeonly sentiments that have been expressed are not shared by many others in this field who are very grateful indeed for the statement that has been made <e> <s> with regard to the question raised by my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls does my noble friend agree that a death-bed conversion is just as welcome as an earlier one <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that the great objection to those poster hoardings is not that they are advertisement hoardings but that they are badly and hideously designed <e> <s> will he give us some indication as to when the cleaning will begin when it will end and above all that as soon as it is completed those eyesores will be removed <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that reply is he aware that the arbitrary division of entries into two categories business and residential makes it extremely difficult to find urgent numbers such as those of doctors <e> <s> is he further aware that worse is to come in that directory inquiries is apparently to be computerised into a metallic voice so that inaccuracy in name or address will mean that the inquirer will not find the number <e>", "<cs> my lords may i have an assurance which many people would welcome <e> <s> can the minister assure me that the black taxi cab service which is the best taxi service in the world will in fact be preserved and not deregulated <e> <s> may i take this opportunity in relation to the remarks made by my noble friend lord bruce-gardyne to wish him luck the next time he wishes to get a taxi <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that helpful answer <e> <s> is he aware that the close of ely cathedral which was recently saved from desecration at the hands of the dean and chapter only by the generosity of mr paul getty is now under threat again from the dean who proposes to breach the medieval wall and intrude into a garden of the close an office building and a car park <e> <s> coming on top of what has been going on at salisbury and the mishandling of the mappa mundi at hereford does this not show that deans are dangerous <e> <s> would it not be a great help i am sure that the right reverend prelate agrees with me if the government enabled deans to get on with their proper job which is that of serving god and they looked after mammon <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for her helpful and constructive reply <e> <s> is she aware that it is now proposed to factory farm red deer in order to provide venison for supermarkets <e> <s> is it not an outrage to confine such sensitive and essentially wild creatures in conditions similar to those for pigs <e> <s> will the government intervene to put a stop to it <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the monarch of the glen knows as much about agriculture as the queen of sheba knows about the arts <e> <s> will she have a look at the walford college of agriculture in shropshire where experiments are being carried out in this vein <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that when the passport is handed in one will receive not another blue british passport but a limp piece of vermilion plastic <e> <s> can he do something about that so that we can retain our traditional blue passport <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble and learned friend for that answer <e> <s> however does he agree that the crown courts are <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that while it is extremely important to preserve our past heritage it is equally important to ensure that our own generation adds worthily to it <e> <s> is not mr peter palumbo to be congratulated on commissioning a first-rate building from a major british architect <e> <s> is he not also to be congratulated on his persistence determination and tenacity which make bruce and the spider seem pusillanimous <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has suggested that one contacts an environmental health officer when faced with this problem <e> <s> can he advise the house how one contacts such an officer on a saturday or a sunday <e>", "<cs> my lords does not my noble friend agree that if the remains of this great patriot and friend of britain were laid to rest in his own country it would do more than anything else symbolically to help the great changes that are taking place in poland and would be a way of laying to rest too the still repeated calumny that the british government had someting culpable to do with the circumstances of his death <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for what i take to be an eirenic reply <e> <s> does he agree that these royal parks constitute a most important part of our national heritage <e> <s> is it not right to protect them from the proposed disruptions arising from ventilation shafts for a new underground railway earthworks for power lines and commercial encroachments from the suggested equestrian centre <e> <s> would not conservation status help the parks to resist such depredations <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that aristophrenic reply <e> <s> will the government consider setting up a fund on the lines of the national heritage fund which within its resources would make matching grants for money raised by appeals in the private sector <e> <s> would not the permanent safeguarding of our cathedrals the most precious jewels in our heritage crown not only be worth while in itself but also constitute a fitting commemoration of the coming millenium <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that i am greatly indebted to him for his constructive and open-minded reply which promises well for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has mentioned the situation of the homeless <e> <s> will he tell the house what the government are doing to help those in london and our large cities who are without homes <e> <s> is it not an affront to the conscience of the nation that so many people young and old should have to spend christmas on the streets <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that helpful reply to my question which has not so much been superseded by events as placed in a new context <e> <s> can he say what international action is being taken to provide food for romania particularly in the rural areas where <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for pressing my noble friend on this point but can he give some guarantee that action will be taken this week <e> <s> there are many people in romania at starvation point and unless aid reaches them soon it will be too late <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that helpful answer <e> <s> is he aware that the streets of many of our great cities especially london now resemble battlefields and that the residents are continually tormented by the chatter and vibration of electric drills <e> <s> should not companies such as westminster cable television which are profiting from the use of the public <e>", "<cs> my lords would a way out of this miserable dilemma be for the government to consider amending the law of blasphemy so that it covered insults to the moslem religion <e> <s> then the moslem community would have some other recourse a non violent recourse to satisfy their outraged feelings <e>",

intimated by either <e> <s> does he agree that the three graces represents a major work of the th century classical sculpture revival which was commissioned for britain and should be retained here <e> <s> does he further agree that the situation has been dramatically transformed for the better by mr jacob rothschilds generous and ingenious offer at the weekend involving million <e> <s> what is the governments policy regarding that offer <e> <s> that is not subject either to litigation or court action <e> <s> may we have a positive response to that offer <e> <s> in view of this capricious incident does the minister agree that the rules governing export of works of art should be reviewed <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that we now know that no fewer than four ministries are involved in the matter <e> <s> since there is only a fortnight before the export ban expires is it not right that the suggestion of the noble lord lord strabolgi should be followed otherwise between all those ministeries the matter will be fumbled <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend explain how the stamps without value do not get letters delivered abroad and the stamps with value do not get letters delivered here <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend agree that the one thing needed to be a good teacher is a teaching nature <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply and i give it if i may two cheers <e> <s> i ask him to accept my congratulations on having advanced this cause so substantially <e> <s> does he realise that a private purchaser is wholly acceptable provided the public have permanent access to the object <e> <s> meanwhile can he tell the house what has happened to mr jacob rothschilds ingenious offer <e> <s> has that fallen into limbo or is it about to be resurrected <e>", "<cs> my lords cannot we all give four cheers for the barclay brothers <e> <s> if one simple amendment to the offer were made instead of the public being allowed to see the item for years they would be allowed to see it in perpetuity <e> <s> in those circumstances everybody would be happy <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply to which i am able to give one cheer <e> <s> is he aware that many in the art world would accept the intervention of private funding in this sphere if there were access for the public in perpetuity and a permanent export ban <e> <s> but in the absence of a public interest what possible grounds can a conservative government have for intervening and distinguishing between one private owner and another <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the framework within which the owners make their decision is laid down by the government <e> <s> when shall we hear what that framework is <e> <s> is it not a fact that the longer the situation continues and the more ministers are involved the greater the state of confusion <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> i very much welcome the lifting of the proposed ban on religious bodies owning satellite television stations which occurred since i put down my question <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that one way forward in this difficult and perplexing area would be to have a religious station jointly owned by the mainstream religions including the jewish faith from which we draw a great many of our values <e> <s> would that not be a truly ecumenical venture <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> but can i ask him to go further than the broadcasting bill <e> <s> in view of the great potential satellite television has for the future should not the government positively encourage new entrants into this field which would create a market and by competition raise standards <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> while i welcome the proposals to penalise the worst abuses practised by a minority of estate agents is not the only long-term solution to the problem to transform estate agency into a properly regulated profession with qualifications for entry <e> <s> while the government are considering that possibility will my noble friend also consider whether written offers to purchase property should not be made binding <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that i obtained a copy of the regulations through the devious means of asking the library <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend accept the gratitude of everyone who is interested in the hospice movement for her encouraging words <e> <s> in view of some of the comments that have been made can she make it clear that the hospice movement exists not only for people who are doomed to die but for people who are seriously ill but will recover and leave the hospice <e> <s> therefore there is hope in the hospice <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend recall that although the window tax was graduated it was an extremely easy tax to avoid
