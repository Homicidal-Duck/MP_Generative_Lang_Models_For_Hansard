["<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord mansfield i beg to introduce a bill to make new provision for scotland as respects the law relating to the qualification of jurors to amend the law relating to jury service in scotland to make further provision for scotland in respect of prior rights in the estates of deceased persons to provide a procedure whereby an heir of provision may establish entitlement to act as trustee to remove an obligation to preserve inventories of the estates of deceased persons in scotland to make further provision in respect of performance of the duties of sheriff principal to amend the law relating to the jurisdiction and powers of the sheriff court to empower senators of the college of justice to act as arbiters and oversmen in commercial disputes to make further provision in respect of awards of compensation by the lands <e>", "<cs> we are grateful for the brief way in which my noble friend lord mottistone has outlined his first amendment and has asked these two particular questions <e> <s> as we understand the position it is that each company will stand entirely on its own merits according to the legislation in the bill and according to clause under the definition <e> <s> as we understand it it will be the case that wholly-owned overseas subsidiaries will not be public limited companies under the definition of the bill unless these companies fall within the ambit of public limited companies as defined in other parts of the bill <e> <s> regarding the second case mentioned by my noble friend the governments position is that companies which are limited by guarantee but without a share capital would not meet the criteria of public limited companies as set out in the bill and therefore these would not be public limited companies within the scope of the bill <e> <s> i hope that this will satisfy the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if i mentioned overseas subsidiaries but the wholly-owned subsidiary of a united kingdom public limited company if that subsidiary fulfils the requirements in the bill of a public limited company could be a public limited company of its own accord <e> <s> but if the subsidiary does not fulfil all the requirements as set out in the bill then the subsidiary company will not be a public limited company <e>", "<cs> the effect of these amendments would be to replace the new definition of public and private companies in clause with the present definition of private company in section of the companies act <e> <s> clause continues to be the cornerstone of the whole bill and any tampering with this clause and the linked amendment to clause schedule would alter the bill grievously <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> i am given to understand that the words of section are indeed written into this clause and are applied to this clause alone <e> <s> section is to be repealed but for these transitional provisions for the companies and small associations that i mentioned <e> <s> i understand that it is necessary to maintain a part of section which is written into the clause i think there is a reference in <e>", "<cs> i should like to assure my noble friend that there will indeed be guidance notes such as he is thinking of <e> <s> that is very much part of the governments plan and i can assure him that these notes will be issued <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i shall repeat a statement which is being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede and also the noble baroness lady seear for their welcome in varying degrees for the statement <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope once again that there were no implicit threats but i should like to stress to the noble lord lord jacques that three months ago he was asking about the pay of postal workers in that particular part of the service <e> <s> three months ago the post office offered a pay increase of per cent <e> <s> plus a further per cent <e> <s> which was to be paid for by way of three particular items <e> <s> this package was successfully negotiated with the postal workers executive but it was rejected by five to one by the union membership <e> <s> negotiations are still continuing <e> <s> we believe that the offer that has been made is certainly generous and i wonder whether in the light of that generous offer an inquiry is called for at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that negotiations should be continued with the postal workers but with the executive <e> <s> i believe that if any investigation needs to be carried out it should be carried out within the union of postal workers and not within the post office as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend for those two questions <e> <s> i do not think that the government or indeed the post office can give any firm reply as to whether it is the intention of the post office to employ postal workers for further extensive hours of overtime during the next three of four weekends <e> <s> i hope the post office will do what it deems necessary to clear the backlog <e> <s> that may involve some overtime or it may not <e>", "<cs> my lords i would take issue slightly with my noble friend <e> <s> i agree that the service appears to be worse in some areas but i think that <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord and i take his point but of course all members of your lordships house will be aware that your lordships and indeed members of the public obtain what we pay for <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the government are concerned i am sure they are considering every form of improvement of the post office as a whole <e> <s> i do not think it would be for me to comment at this stage on any possibilities or probabilities of separation or otherwise of the telecommunications industry from the post office as a whole <e>", "<cs> failing a wish on the part of any other member of the committee to speak i will be as brief as possible <e> <s> i noticed that the eloquence of the noble lord lord mishcon was in its usual flowing state but that he appeared to be a little more cautious and to be sticking fairly closely to the subject <e> <s> i hope that he and the committee will allow me to stick equally closely to the fairly lengthy amendment he has just moved <e>", "<cs> if i may reply instantly the noble lord lord wedderburn may care to see when the peachey report was signed <e> <s> this is rather like being a rabbit in a shooting gallery <e> <s> this is not necessarily personal but the noble lord rains the points down very sharply <e> <s> perhaps a more apposite comparison would be that it is like facing some of the famed tennis stars at wimbledon <e> <s> i do my best but i must point out that this report was published and signed on th december <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is now prepeating at a slower pace which i have been able to grasp and which perhaps the rest of the committee has been able to grasp his first argument <e> <s> the government do not believe that they should make such haste <e> <s> the noble lord has said that there will be two companies bills <e> <s> indeed i look forward to hearing just the same speech as the noble lord has made during the proceedings on the companies bill when we shall deal with exactly the same matters as we are dealing with tonight <e> <s> we want this matter to be as perfect as we can make it <e> <s> i do not believe and indeed the government do not believe that we shall get it right at this stage <e> <s> there are several consultative processes which we wish to continue <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank my noble friend lord mottistone for moving these amendments so carefully <e> <s> i hope it will meet the agreement of the committee if like my noble friend i too take the three amendments nos <e> <s> and together <e> <s> it appears that the question of time which has been allowed to make the changeover from an old name to a new name is the reason for the amendments <e> <s> in earlier consultations it was thought and we have heard this from my noble friend that six months was unreasonable <e> <s> on the contrary it has also <e>", "<cs> i will go at a more moderate pace <e> <s> i apologise <e> <s> the committee is coming to its end it is getting late and we have had a long day <e> <s> i sensed that it was the feeling of the committee that we should press on but i do take my noble friends point that this is complicated <e> <s> at the moment i have not got down to the most complicated pieces but i will heed his warning <e> <s> i take also as always points from the noble and learned lord opposite to go steadily and to make as few mistakes as possible with the law <e>", "<cs> i must apologise if i was short-tempered with the noble lord but we have been practical <e> <s> if anybody <e>", "<cs> i mentioned fifteen months <e>", "<cs> i am under instructions that we will consult and confirm our observations before the report stage <e>", "<cs> before we conclude may i say that i think there is nothing between the government and my noble friend on his question of biscuit tins or other containers <e> <s> i mentioned milk bottles at length simply because i had not any further tangible or practical experience of other items <e> <s> what we are concerned with in clause is statutory names by which companies will be known <e> <s> with the galaxy of lawyers on the opposition benches this is what they are going to be dealing with not the question of misrepresentation which i think is what the noble lord lord mottistone and myself have argued over for many years on consumerism correct labelling and correct description of the goods <e> <s> what is at issue tonight in clause and these amendments is the statutory name of the company <e> <s> very often what one finds on the biscuit tin or anything else will be a registered brand name and goodness knows what will happen when we come into the territory of pharmaceuticals and similar products <e> <s> then we find even greater problems because very often one needs a magnifying glass to find out the name of the company and where it is registered <e> <s> tonight we are worried about the statutory name of a public limited company <e>", "<cs> my lords i would suggest to the noble and learned lord that never could i have received such reprobation and a word of caution with such charming demeanour <e> <s> i should like to thank him and also take careful note of what he has said <e> <s> although if the noble and learned lord believes that legislation is dealt with in another place with more contumely perhaps he will recall some of the later stages of the committee stage of this bill in your lordships house when some of us on the government front bench felt i seem to remember myself quoting something like a rabbit in a shooting gallery as the points rained down <e> <s> we fielded some of them <e> <s> we moved three amendments <e> <s> i take note of the pea of st anthony so carefully put forward by the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i hope we can suggest that this is a mere pod of peas but at least that this is a start to the stew <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to remind the noble lord lord lloyd that this is report stage <e> <s> perhaps he could ask a question <e> <s> if he could draw his remarks to a conclusion they ought to be in the form of a question <e>", "<cs> my lords one or two points have come to my notice <e> <s> first i would apologise to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> first of all i particularly should like to thank my noble friends lord mottistone and lord redmayne for raising this very important question of the time which is to be allowed for public companies to make this particular changeover from their old to their new name <e> <s> the noble lord lord mottistone has pointed out that i gave various assurances during the <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to my noble friend lord auckland for raising this very interesting and important issue this evening <e> <s> i should say immediately to my noble friend and the house that although what i shall have to say in reply to my noble friends question will be fairly brief neither i nor indeed the government regard the question or its subject matter as unimportant <e>", "<cs> my lords not only do i understand it but i am interested in the spelling because it seems that the acronym does not come out as it should <e> <s> never mind my lords <e> <s> representations have been made through both the mail users association and the post office users national council and also directly to ministers and the government especially tonight <e> <s> i shall have time i hope to explain that the government do not think that it would be right to subsidise the postal charges on these special items <e> <s> my noble friend pointed out that the united states gives it seems much better rates on the postage of periodicals and magazines <e> <s> my noble friend quoted the particular instance from the united states to australia probably western australia or perhaps the whole continent of australia <e> <s> i certainly believe his claim <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very pleased to do that <e> <s> i take careful note of everything that has been said by my noble friend as well as by the noble lord lord ponsonby <e> <s> if there is anything that i have missed then i shall certainly be in touch with them before your lordships disappear to the far-flung areas mentioned by both noble lords <e> <s> my imagination was stirred by the thought of how much we might have to pay to send trade journals to the south pole and other settlements <e> <s> i shall be interested to hear the views of noble lords when there is a fuller house <e> <s> i hope we can leave it there tonight and i undertake to see that everything that has been raised in your lordships house tonight is brought to the careful attention of both my right honourable friend and the post office not forgetting the two organisations which the noble lord lord ponsonby mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have received the inspectors report and expect to announce their decision shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords the relief of any congestion at heathrow and indeed increase of services elsewhere for instance at gatwick will continue to be the important objective of the governments civil aviation policies <e> <s> to this end the british airports authority will continue to maintain its present policy of widening the disparity in the landing and the other charges at heathrow and gatwick and indeed the policy will continue of allowing no airline which is not currently operating scheduled international passenger services at heathrow to begin operations there <e>", "<cs> my lords we accept the noble lords proposition that there is great urgency but we believe that there is a relatively short time until the publication of the report and until the report is published we believe it would be in-appropriate to comment further on any steps that might be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i think if the noble baroness lady burton will wait to see what is in the report we might then be able to take a firm stand but i do not think it is right to commit the government to take any action at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the assumptions which have been taken into account in the report will be prepared and put forward in the report <e> <s> i could not comment further on the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are always pleased to receive invitations from the noble lord parry but noble lords will be aware after listening to radio reports of congestion on the main motorway to and from london that at this stage the suggestion is i think inappropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is another question but the government have no intention of rushing any authorities into precipitate decisions <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that concorde is even faster <e>", "<cs> my lords no quota under the multi-fibre arrangement has been exceeded <e> <s> the government are satisfied that where other suppliers exceed agreed or notified levels action is taken as quickly as possible <e> <s> allegations of dumping or subsidy are investigated by the eec commission under the relevant provisions of the gatt <e> <s> i know of no case which has been subject to a delay of three years but if the noble baroness would care to send me details i will look into the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lady hornsby-smith has covered a varied number of points in her supplementary question <e> <s> however she opened with a comment on quotas <e> <s> it would be reasonable if i were to point out to my noble friend that as regards particular textile quotas under the multi-fibre <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not entirely clear about where there is a staff shortage whether it is at the eec or in this country <e> <s> if the shortage of staff is at the commission i do not think that the government can be held responsible <e> <s> if the noble lord is complaining of a shortage of staff in the department of trade i would not necessarily agree with him on that score <e> <s> certainly the house may feel that my noble friend lady hornsby-smith has a case <e> <s> the government are looking into it and are aware of most of the abuses <e> <s> but as i pointed out in my original answer if the noble baroness knows of a particularly outrageous case of dumping i should be very glad to look into it and try to settle it <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the government are aware the commission is doing everything it can to invoke these safeguard arrangements and i think the government are satisfied that these arrangements are satisfactory <e> <s> nevertheless i will look into the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that question is verging away from the original question <e> <s> however i shall certainly look into the matter and inform my noble friend in detail <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are aware of the situation as regards products under both the multi-fibre arrangement and other voluntary arrangements entering the country from south-east asia <e> <s> however i think that that question is a little wide of the question that has been raised as regards the eec commission <e> <s> the government cannot be responsible for the shortage of staff in the eec commission but the government are doing their best to assist so far <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are indeed aware of the level of unemployment in the wool textile industry <e> <s> nevertheless the government believe in upholding agreements such as are embodied in the multi-fibre agreement <e> <s> i do not think that i can go much further on the question of united states oil pricing than i went in my original answer to my noble friend lady hornsby-smith <e> <s> at present that is as far as i can go <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have received a number of allegations that imports of shetland knitwear arriving from mauritius have not originated in that country <e> <s> these allegations are being urgently investigated <e> <s> at the governments request the eec commission has asked the mauritian authorities to agree to voluntary limits for their exports to the united kingdom of knitwear <e> <s> we have asked that these negotiations be pressed as a matter of extreme urgency <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are at one with the noble baroness in her wish to decide this matter urgently and very quickly <e> <s> the government are determined that it shall be decided within a matter of months rather than years <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is another question but i should be happy at any time to engage in discussions with the noble lord outside the chamber on the trade descriptions act <e>", "<cs> my lords the information that the government have is that no countries are exceeding their quota by exporting garments via mauritius <e> <s> i think it is important that the house should understand that <e> <s> the garments coming in from mauritius at the present time seem to be produced in that country <e>", "<cs> my lords i will convey the noble lords wish to the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are treating this as a matter of urgency and there are negotiations in progress at this moment both in mauritius and in the united kingdom <e> <s> the customs and excise are taking particular care to examine all the garments which are in question to see that they are indeed of the type described and from mauritius <e> <s> it is being treated as a matter of urgency both in mauritius and here <e>", "<cs> my lords i could attempt to find out and let the noble viscount know but i think that might be another question for another minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e> <s> your lordships may be aware that insurance companies in great britain are at present authorised and supervised under the insurance companies act while those in northern ireland are subject to separate but virtually identical northern ireland legislation <e> <s> the insurance companies bill which i now commend to your lordships will establish a uniform regime by extending the act and the relevant statutory instruments to northern ireland and repealing the northern ireland insurance companies legislation <e> <s> i should like to stress at this stage that the bill is basically a technical measure <e> <s> it makes no material change to insurance supervision in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the leaflet to which the noble lord refers was sent to approximately million addresses without telephones as well as some million dwellings with telephones <e> <s> the cost was approximately <e>", "<cs> my lords the post office is all the time attempting to increase its standards of productivity and the noble lord will i am sure accept the fact that this leaflet was sent out to allay alarm which had been felt by many of the customers of the post office <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it would benefit the house and help my noble friend if i were to explain that the method used for the delivery of this leaflet was the post offices household delivery service which was both the quickest and cheapest method of providing this information to telephone customers <e> <s> there was a considerable cost saving in both money and time <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be churlish of me not to reciprocate the kind wishes of the noble baroness and indeed her charm and courtesy is welcome as indeed was also that of her colleague who spoke earlier on a scottish motion <e> <s> in commending these orders we hope that they will make a generous contribution to the economy of scotland and of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that one intervention should be sufficient <e>", "<cs> my lords the first thing i should like to do this evening is to <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i may return that comment with the reply that i believe the noble baroness has misunderstood me <e> <s> i was not associating her point with paragraph i had finished with paragraph <e> <s> the point she raised very early on was that in general these directives and this directive in particular were somewhat unwanted and she asked whether the government could bring pressure to bear i think that that was the gist of her comment to stop these unwanted unnecessary and otiose directives coming <e> <s> i shall certainly ensure that her views are passed on <e> <s> it may be that it is not a matter for my department indeed it is far more likely to be within the province of my noble friend lord trefgarne and the foreign office at a diplomatic level <e> <s> i take the point of the noble baroness but stress that it is not connected with paragraph of the report <e>", "<cs> my lords i see that i have been on my feet for a number of minutes and i hope that i have set out and stressed the governments view that directives should lay down minimum standards <e> <s> i think that the noble baroness lady seear quite fairly raised the point with me that some of the directives in spite of wishing to raise minimum standards were muddled and woolly <e> <s> i do not think that there is anything between the noble lord lord jacques and myself and i hope that there <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not think i can <e> <s> certainly not tonight <e> <s> i think it is highly unlikely that it would be finally implemented <e> <s> i hope that the consumer credit act is in no way what i have been describing as woolly thinking and is not subject to the criticisms that we have made of some of the more loosely worded directives tonight <e> <s> the principle is the same that problems have arisen since and that we shall attempt to see that the consumer credit act is continually revised and updated <e> <s> i could not certainly not tonight give the noble lord lord mishcon any guarantee as to when we would see the consumer credit act as being in its final perfect form <e> <s> nevertheless i shall write to him later about that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft weights and measures act milk order laid before the house on th november be approved <e> <s> this order will allow liquid milk to be sold in an alternative range of prescribed metric quantities from st january <e> <s> the existing range of imperial quantities already prescribed under the weights and measures act is not affected by this order since the government do not intend to dictate the pace of metrication by phasing out these imperial sizes <e> <s> specifically nothing in the order prevents the trade from continuing to deliver the traditional and most popular pint bottle to the doorstep <e> <s> this honours assurances given by successive governments for the last or years <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful for the welcome we have had for this order from the noble lord lord ponsonby <e> <s> i just wondered whether the noble lord was stepping back into the previous debate about sex films and that kind of thing if he was wondering about two-packs <e> <s> i am not sure what is the capacity of what the noble lord was calling single person packs <e> <s> he will be reassured to know that millilitre packs of milk are legal now by this order <e> <s> nevertheless i have not got the answer <e> <s> i am not sure about odd packs let us say millilitres or something like that which may be a two-person pack but i shall endeavour to find out and inform the noble lord as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is right but the noble lord and the house should know me better and that we shall be back i hope at these benches before that date <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the noble lords comments and i am sure that if he and i could between us lift a kilogram sack of coal we should be very happy <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for explaining the purpose of his amendment so clearly and concisely but i think it would be for the benefit of the committee if i were to clarify one particular aspect of this part of the bill and this refers to the <e>", "<cs> i am terribly sorry that my noble friend is not convinced <e> <s> the point of difference between what i have mentioned and what my noble friend says rests entirely on the notices i have referred to and above all on what the government believe would be the convenient way to inform the coach operators which would be through their association <e> <s> i fear that i cannot give a promise to bring forward anything more conclusive or much clearer <e> <s> i shall certainly examine what my noble friend has said but i hope he will accept that the <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> we have considerable sympathy with my noble friend lord inglewood and indeed with the noble lord lord ross of marnock whose <e>", "<cs> i should like to finish this particular point if i may <e> <s> british rail are considering i am told that this will cover a matter of months much more <e>", "<cs> i do not think that is possible <e> <s> the railway by-laws extend throughout the united kingdom not to england alone not to england and wales nor to scotland separately but throughout the united kingdom wherever british rail run their services <e> <s> therefore it would i am given to understand be impossible to extend restrictions on the carriage of alcohol on railway trains to football supporters using the trains within scotland just as it would be totally outside the scope of this bill to control the carriage of alcohol by scottish supporters going to watch scotland playing in england on trains which are passing through carlisle or even berwick <e>", "<cs> i cannot go further than what i have said so far but may i make it absolutely clear to my noble friend lord teviot that any alterations in the permission given to any person to take alcohol on a football special train anywhere in the united kingdom in scotland or in england or in wales are outside the scope of this bill <e> <s> that matter is to be dealt with entirely by british transport by-laws and that is the position so far as railway travel by football fans is concerned <e>", "<cs> can i make it absolutely clear to my noble friend that i am not <e>", "<cs> i would think that my noble friend lord inglewood seeks by this amendment if i understand his intentions correctly to ensure that the controls on the carriage of alcohol and of drunken spectators on coaches travelling to and from matches will extend not only to travel entirely within scotland hut also to travel to other parts of the united kingdom to attend matches outside scotland and secondly to travel from other parts of the united kingdom to attend matches within scotland <e> <s> i hope to try to explain how the provisions as they stand in the bill would be expected to apply <e> <s> controls on the carriage of alcohol on coaches and other vehicles would since this is a scottish measure apply only within scotland <e> <s> moreover they would apply only in relation to travel to or from these designated events <e> <s> once again since this is a scottish bill only events in scotland can be designated <e> <s> thus travel to or from a scottish match can be subject to control and a coach taking glasgow supporters to a match in manchester would not since the match is in manchester and in england be a designated event hence the coach would not be subject to controls introduced by his clause <e>", "<cs> i hope that i am not parochial <e> <s> the entire bill applies to scotland and the provisions of carrying alcohol on football supporters coaches will apply to any coaches which are attending a match in scotland <e> <s> that is the position <e> <s> anything else will have to be dealt with by an english law dealing with english welsh or scots supporters going to a match in england or wales <e> <s> the whole purpose of this bill is to deal with something which is not a parochial matter in scotland but a very serious matter in scotland <e> <s> i should like to assure the noble lord lord teviot that we hope that these provisions will go some way to curing a scottish problem <e>", "<cs> i am sure the whole committee appreciates the object of the amendments which have been moved by the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> i think this is the first occasion on which he has spoken from the dispatch box <e> <s> if i am right i should like to congratulate him on the excellent way in which he has moved <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is addressing one member of your lordships house who does exactly what he has said <e> <s> i do not often travel by coach but i have travelled by coach to a rugby match which we do not see being designated in scotland at the moment <e>", "<cs> i do not have a heavy goods vehicle licence so that would be illegal <e> <s> but i have considerable experience of seeing football coaches leaving my home town for these matches which will be designated <e> <s> i also had experience in my youth of seeing them leaving glasgow and i see coaches frequently arriving at matches now <e> <s> but i stress that the provision in clause does not mean that a driver who did not authorise the carriage of alcohol and who had no reason at all to believe that it was being carried before he set off on his journey would be liable if during the course of the journey alcohol was discovered and it was very well put by the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> the only duty of the driver at that stage if he had taken all reasonable steps before setting off to see that alcohol was not carried by the passengers as they got on to the coach would be to take any reasonable steps to continue with his journey <e> <s> the instructions that i have are that primary responsibility rests not on the driver who will in most cases be the employee of the licence holder except in the exceptional cases which were described by the noble lord <e> <s> lord galpern <e>", "<cs> but on the hirer of the coach and i understand that the hirer is covered by clause <e>", "<cs> certainly so far as amendments nos <e> <s> and are concerned which i understand cover the duty of the employee as regards carrying alcohol on a coach we will certainly look into everything that has been said and see whether we can make the clause any more clear by bringing it into line with what i have said <e> <s> with that assurance i hope that the noble lord lord underhill will feel able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should stress again that when as we hope this bill is carried into law there will be extensive publicity directed to the new law relating to carrying alcohol on football supporters coaches <e> <s> i believe that this will be circulated to football supporters clubs all around scotland <e> <s> the duties of the driver will be made much easier if the publicity is successful <e> <s> i do not see any necessity for drivers to carry out body searches and i am sure that the provisions of clause would not go so far as that <e>", "<cs> i shall be brief and once again give an assurance that we shall look at what has been said on this amendment and come forward with any suggestions at report stage <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank my noble friend lord teviot for presenting <e>", "<cs> i do not think that my noble friend heard the beginning of my remarks so let me make it crystal clear to him that the words authorises and permits would both cover cases where the person in this case it is the employee had failed to take adequate steps to prevent alcohol being carried on to the coach <e> <s> i think that i said when referring to the two earlier amendments moved by the noble lord <e> <s> lord underhill that we did not think that it was reasonable for a driver to carry out a body search and that would clearly be necessary to discover a hip flask if it were carried on the person of a supporter hoarding the bus <e> <s> we do not think that it is reasonable for the driver to do that <e> <s> hence we do not see that the driver would be liable to have committed an offence if solely a hip flask was carried on by one would hope only one or two of the passengers not by everyone <e>", "<cs> i have nothing further to add except that i shall take my lesson on <e>", "<cs> we discussed t his amendment at an earlier stage and i gave the assurance that we would take this amendment away and look at the clause <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will feel free in the light of my assurance to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we are grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for reminding us again of the levity of the day of the second reading <e> <s> there is one error that the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey made that he should never take or need to take smelling salts <e> <s> i believe they are permitted under the bill at present as a medicinal product <e> <s> the noble and learned lord should know that scotland have scored try for try in all their matches but they have still contrived to lose <e> <s> if scotland win at murrayfield then the noble and learned lord may need his smelling salts but possibly he may need something stronger at the game or outside since it is not envisaged at the moment that murrayfield would as yet be a designated ground but that may come further on <e>", "<cs> it seems that this amendment wishes to introduce into the provisions of this part of the bill applying to the offences of being drunk at a designated sporting event or in a coach travelling to or from an event the additional requirement that the individual concerned was not only drunk but also incapable of looking after himself <e> <s> i do not think that this would be helpful because the term being drunk is not synonymous with the expression being drunk and incapable <e> <s> it is the intention of the provision to deal not merely with those who have consumed so much that they are falling about and are liable to cause themselves injury but also with people who are drunk but whose state is more likely to result in their causing injury to others by their violent behaviour rather than to themselves <e> <s> the term drunk does not require further definition because it will apply simply to a person whose appearance and behaviour is reasonably interpreted as that of a drunken person <e> <s> the noble lord may know that the term drunk is already used and applied in the licensing act to which i referred earlier <e> <s> i think that the reference was to carrying crates on board a bus <e>", "<cs> my lords responsibility for enforcing these provisions rests with the independent certification officer <e> <s> in his report for the certification officer said that the requirements of sections and of the act had raised some difficulties his office was devoting increased attention to these matters with the aim of bringing about a progressive improvement in accounting and auditing standards wherever it was needed <e> <s> i understand that the certification officer will be describing the progress made since then in his annual report for which is due to be published in about three months time <e>", "<cs>

would be necessary if the postal business were to achieve its financial objectives <e>", "<cs> my lords to answer the latter part of my noble friends question the post offices main objective is to achieve increased efficiency and within those parameters the post office has the power to charge what it feels reasonable to achieve its financial and efficiency targets <e>", "<cs> my lords those of us in your lordships house who have been listening to the noble lord lord davies of leek have been observing these signals for many years <e> <s> we have been attracted and charmed by them over the years <e> <s> the post office is looking at all kinds of methods of improving its efficiency but i think the house would not wish to go into the realms of all your lordships imagination <e>", "<cs> my lords i have noticed that one branch sorting office has particular troubles with mechanisation as described by my noble friend though i am not aware it is birmingham <e> <s> perhaps i may be allowed to communicate with my noble friend by letter dare i say by internal letter within your lordships house which tends to be as efficient as the post office <e> <s> i will endeavour to find out and inform my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i can inquire about that but i have no information about it at the moment <e> <s> there are winged messengers behind me but i would not rely upon them <e>", "<cs> my lords i think this is a matter for the post office management in that it is seeking to attract labour where there are areas of labour shortages in the post office <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend in another place is considering this particular point and is awaiting a report on the breaking of the post offices mail monopoly <e> <s> i understand that my right honourable friend will be receiving a report in the very near future and i am told that the indications are that it will be within the next three months <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is in part perfectly correct in some cases the reply to his point is yes while in other instances what he suggests is not the case <e> <s> the post office management is at all times attempting to maximise the use of its available finances mechanised equipment and indeed labour <e>", "<cs> is it not the other way round my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it would be in order for me to reply fairly swiftly to the first point raised by the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey <e> <s> i had not covered amendments nos <e> <s> and in my remarksi thought that probably i had wearied your lordships long enough on the first two amendments which were in the style of paving amendments as the noble and learned lord rightly pointed out <e> <s> he went on to refer to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> the first comment the noble and learned lord made was about the linchpin of our amendment being designation of an event <e> <s> we see the merit of what he said in that so far as i am aware guidelines are already available not necessarily for the transport authorities but there are thoughts already as to which events should be designated events and i hasten to reassure the noble and learned lord about the events to which he was referring when he was last with us either in committee or on second reading when he spoke of murrayfieldthat is not yet scheduled to be a designated event but we see that

whether there are crowds of alcoholic persons going around to other functions or that dare i say it <e> <s> womens rural outings devolve into incredible orgies <e> <s> i do not think so <e> <s> but i should think the driver has some experience of driving <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that that is the case <e> <s> i am given to understand that it is not the interpretation of this clause that

seems rather like the curates egg yes and no in various parts <e> <s> the noble lord is right in saying that the driver should continue if he discovers that alcohol is on board the coach if it is a reasonable thing to do and if the driver could take steps to have the alcohol put off the coach then no he is not allowed to continue <e>", "<cs> my lords the house has heard quite enough from me on

should like to thank the noble and learned lord for his generous welcome for what we have tried to achieve with the amendment <e> <s> we shall look at it again <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to reply very swiftly and briefly to my noble friend lord inglewood <e> <s> at the outset i should like to say that the british transport police whom he has described when dealing with any offences which relate to or which are committed on railway property enjoy exactly the same powers as the regular police under the existing law <e> <s> as my noble friend said they are the county policebut i think that they would be a regional police force in scotland <e> <s> therefore we can see no necessity for a special provision such as that which is contained in this amendment in

made under the consumer safety act be approved <e> <s> the proposal to make these regulations is prompted by the realisation that statutory intervention is necessary to reduce the fire risk presented by much of the modern upholstered furniture on sale to the public about which for some time past there has been considerable concern <e> <s> this concern has arisen primarily on account of the use of polyurethane foam as a filling material although fire hazards are by no means confined to furniture containing polyurethane foam <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin by thanking the noble lord lord wallace for what he had to say about the regulations and for his kind words about my presentation of what i think the house will agree is quite a complicated chemical subject <e> <s> i note that the

soft furnishings <e>", "<cs> my lords i suggest that this is a matter which the department can consider <e> <s> i suspect that it might require considerable discussion with the manufacturers and the research organisations <e> <s> i understand that this is part of a great parcel of subjects being discussed with the organisations <e> <s> perhaps i can make a note of the noble lords particular query

drafted in such a way that its effect is still somewhat uncertain and that particularity is in itself a major reason for caution <e>", "<cs> we can very well understand the reasons which led the noble lord lord mccarthy and his noble friends to table this particular amendment <e> <s> when we look at subsection of clause and if we look particularly at paragraph <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mccarthy opened his presentation of the amendment with real fire and vehemence but lost me when he described this as a different category <e> <s> he did not say whether the man had been expelled but seemed to leave the poor person in limbo <e> <s> he referred to inexact legalism which i would describe as a sort of interesting ritual dance but it still seemed to leave the unfortunate person

criticised the government in fairly round terms <e> <s> he castigated small businesses and had a good political dig at my honourable colleague down the corridor <e> <s> he mentioned badgers and other

for unfair dismissal in respect of any employee unless in this particular case he had notified that employee on engagement when that employee first signed the contract of employment or was taken on that he the employee would have to serve an extra year before acquiring the right to make a complaint of any unfair dismissal <e>", "<cs> we should like to thank the noble lord lord spens for putting forward the amendment so succinctly and so clearly at this late hour and we also wish to thank the noble viscount lord <e>", "<cs> may i attempt to explain what we believe are the effects of the amendments to which the noble lord lord wedderburn has just spoken <e> <s> they would amend the employment protection consolidation act so that an employer who engaged an employee for a task which would be completed at an unspecified time would be and this is the nice word deemed to be taking the employee on a fixed term contract <e> <s> thus if the contract expired without being renewed the employee would be deemed to have been dismissed and so he or she would have the right to complain of unfair dismissal and <e>", "<cs> the committee will have been interested to hear the comments of the noble lord lord mccarthy <e> <s> he made great play with the problems of the lower paid but i wonder whether those problems are relevant to the provisions of this clause <e> <s> i should like first to remind the committee that under the provisions of clause an employee is entitled to a guaranteed payment by his employer to a current maximum of a day for the first five days of lay-off in each quarter <e> <s> one wonders what are the reasons behind these provisions <e> <s> it would be interesting to examine them <e> <s> they were primarily designed to cover lay-offs of short duration <e> <s> the responsibility for paying workers during lay-offs of this kind which normally last no more than a few days should fall just as properly on the employer as on the state <e> <s> the present provisions with the built-in limits were designed to ensure that employers should provide minimum standards of protection to workers on temporary or short-term lay-offs <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do adjourn during pleasure until eight oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or even to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft insurance transfer of general business regulations laid before the house on nd june be approved <e> <s> these regulations implement a requirement of the european communities non-life

industry does for the united kingdom especially his last comment about the balance of payments and how we would wish to improve our balance of payments in general with the community <e> <s> the noble lord took a fairly firm line with this directive on insurance services which we are grateful he gave some advance notice of but in general i have nothing very detailed to add to what the noble lord and clearly he is an expert has dealt with <e> <s> i refer to the specialised professional matters as well as the other matters he was speaking about in regard to our mutual profession <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that we on these benches would join with other noble lords and indeed the whole house in expressing our indebtedness once again to my noble friend lord buxton of alsa for raising what i have found to be a fascinating question on oil pollution of the sea by ships which is undoubtedly a matter of continuing public interest and concern and above all of especial concern to your lordships house <e>", "<cs> i have more to say on that subject my lords and if the noble lord will be patient he may find that i will cover the point he has in mind <e> <s> the noble lord lord kennet

friend that these problems are being considered at the moment and indeed that all views are being taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend does not expect me to go beyond

other age groups depend on the success of the governments policies designed to reduce inflation and create a climate for investment and enterprise which in turn will lead to increased economic activity and lower unemployment <e> <s> the government do not themselves create job opportunities but the manpower services commissions youth opportunities programme provides work preparation and training schemes for the young unemployed which have proved successful in helping young people into regular employment <e> <s> this programme has been expanded to provide about per cent <e> <s> more places in the year and this will enable the commission to continue to operate its undertakings to unemployed school-leavers and to young people who have been unemployed for months or more <e> <s> also the temporary short-time working compensation scheme and the job release scheme will contribute towards reducing unemployment and helping hard-hit groups such as school-leavers <e>", "<cs> my lords

much to crow about at the central glasgow election <e> <s> the noble lord is correct <e> <s> unemployment is at a very grave level in scotland <e> <s> this is one of the reasons why the government are increasing their expenditure on the youth opportunities programme just for the school-leavers that the noble lord mentioned <e> <s> the government are doing everything they can to assist in this grave

the comments made by the noble baroness and i will pass them on to my noble friend lady young <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may reply to the noble lord lord bruce and i am grateful for the support from my noble friend i have said three times that the government do not create employment <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord bruce certainly understood that and he realises that <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord will appreciate that the matters he attributed to my right honourable friend the secretary of state may be relevant but i would remind the noble lord that these matters of young people entering jobs and of their respective wage rates are very largely a matter for collective bargaining <e> <s> certainly the wages of both young people and other people in employment are very carefully considered by the employers and the unions with particular relevance to the possibility of giving young people opportunities to enter industry <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an interesting suggestion <e> <s> i shall pass it on to my noble friend the minister but i would stress that we believe the youth opportunities programme is the best and most relevant source of aid in this continuing problem

noble lord lord mccarthy carefully read out it was i in fact who undertook to reconsider the position <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord and the house will note that the concluding comments that i made were with the hope of having something to submit on report <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that this particular clause in spite of the very interesting arguments that have been advanced by the noble lord lord mccarthy provides a very limited exemption <e> <s> we intend to allow small employers <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave perhaps i could reply briefly to one point <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house and i hope that i shall have it as greater providence has not yet struck me down may i say that the noble baroness lady seear raised one particular point which i think was relevant to what the noble lord lord mccarthy had to say <e> <s> it was that small employers were very worried about the legislation and that we should have legislation which was indeed clear <e> <s> i know and i am sure that noble lords all round the house will know that it is not so much what is written into the legislation as what employers believe that is said and feel how the legislation treats them <e> <s> above all with small firms it is the amount of time that the proprietor or the management have to spend on particular cases of this type <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion which stands in the name of my noble friend lord mansfield on the order paper <e>", "<cs> i think the question was put and the contents did not reply <e> <s> i am afraid that the not-contents

place early last year that questions had been asked in your lordships house and that answers had been given under the previous administration <e> <s> i believe that these went some way towards alleviating fears of the organisations not just of the general council of british shipping <e> <s> we understand that the organisations which would be and indeed are concerned with this order are now very broadly satisfied and happy with the provisions of the order <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i had hoped that the amendments were relatively clear <e> <s> i would think that the fact that the health service is being reorganised in england and wales at present has nothing to do with this amendment <e> <s> but we will check what the noble lord has said and come back to it on

to thank both the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the lack of clarity was on my side and i apologise <e> <s> it was certainly in my mind that the noble viscount was worried about the lack of discussion <e> <s> i hope that i said that we do not think there is anything that we can enact by statute to enforce discussion between employees and employers on this or any other special subject <e>

companies have to publish as they will have to do what they have done and their possible programme for the employment of disabled persons they will take this into account and will discuss it possibly informally with their employees <e> <s> with that i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house do now adjourn during pleasure until eight oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all noble lords who have given the order what i believe was in general a very charming welcome <e> <s> perhaps i may attempt to answer some of the questions i was going to say peer by peer

point with the noble lord and with others of your lordships who take particular care over the drafting <e> <s> the noble baroness lady seear made the point about the million threshold for me because she thought it was relevant <e> <s> she had one other query so far as i recall and that was to do with local monopolies and the level of what might or might not be described as a local monopoly <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer which i hope might satisfy the noble baroness is that where we find that there is what is termed a monopoly in a local area and this is over per cent <e> <s> i shall come to this later the anticompetitive behaviour of the firm which the noble baroness finds might be blatant even can be and indeed will be investigated even if the firm is below the million limit <e> <s> but we believe that there are adequate powers in the act for such anti-competitive behaviour to be investigated <e> <s> we believe that the director general already has powers to investigate <e> <s> of course such behaviour has to be brought to his notice but we do not think that there is any special problem as far as local monopoly is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords no the normal export credits

clear or specific views <e> <s> there have been roundabout views which have appeared through the press <e> <s> my right honourable friend should be very grateful to receive any further observations

seek by sheer weight of numbers to stop others from going to work or delivering or collecting goods <e> <s> such mass picketing whether or not it is described as a demonstration goes beyond peaceful persuasion and may well result in breaches of the peace or other criminal offences <e> <s> the law provides immunity only from civil actions and it does so only for those who picket peacefully at their own place of work <e> <s> however we agree with the noble lord that it is important for the code to be absolutely clear on this point and we shall certainly consider whether something more can be done in the final version of the code <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i should go much beyond my original answer except to stress that if picketing goes beyond peaceful persuasion criminal behaviour consists of intimidation of any sort then there is a clear breach of the criminal law and that can be dealt with under the appropriate law <e> <s> the code does not necessarily have relevance in that area <e>", "<cs> my lords i am tempted to ask which government and which policies <e> <s> however i think that we are hours too late <e> <s> i tried to deal with closed shops yesterday <e> <s> i do not think i can go further than my previous answers on the civil and the criminal law <e>", "<cs> my lords in so far as it is within my power i will certainly do that <e> <s> i will pass on my noble friends comments to my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i am not going deaf <e> <s> did i hear the noble lord say sound language <e>", "<cs> my lords if i have heard aright from noble lords opposite there could be most interesting definitions of what is and what is not foul language but i think we should leave intimidation and matters of that sort to the courts and especially to noble and learned lords be they on the woolsack or in other parts of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be fascinated to go into etymological details with the noble lord over the teacups or perhaps in other parts of your lordships house but i shall bear his comments in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords the government very much regret that the trades union congress has made it clear that it does not support the code particularly as the government have drawn on the tucs own guidance in its own pamphlets when drafting this particular code <e> <s> the government do not believe that the decision of the tuc reflects the views of the majority of its members who have been shown consistently to support the employment act and indeed the codes of practice <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be happy to try to give the noble and learned lord an answer but i fear the wrath of the usual channels more than i do the house <e> <s> however i shall

having in nigeria <e> <s> but in all cases the government are ready to do whatever they can to assist the united kingdom manufacturers concerned who suffer loss of both sales and reputation from this practice <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to hear the value of the parts which are sold every year in the united kingdom but if my right honourable friend is to issue warnings or is to take any action on safety grounds he requires specific evidence <e> <s> therefore if my noble friend would get in touch with my right honourable friend or the department then i am sure the department would be able to take action for indeed it has a great interest in safety matters of this type <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the existing british standards are followed by manufacturers in this country and indeed there are provisions in the road traffic act setting out grounds for prosecutions in cases where defective parts have led to a loss of safety or an accident <e> <s> i do not think we would want to take further action than that at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords to answer the first part of my noble friends supplementary question this can be dealt with by the patent laws which are applicable to this country and to other nations <e> <s> where there is clear evidence of breach of the patent law the government may take action but i do not think i can say anything more specific

reply to the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> i hope he will accept indeed the house should know by now that a fierce scottish heart beats here in the absence of my noble friend lord mansfield

training retraining resettlement and job creation of which at least half is reserved for schemes in regions of high unemployment including the united kingdoms assisted areas <e> <s> this year the united kingdom has been allocated million from the social fund <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may reply briefly to my noble friend <e> <s> first i would apologise to the house for the length of the answer but as i am sure the house will appreciate if your lordships care to glance at the question on the order paper it is an extremely long and complicated question to which i hope i gave a reasonable and satisfactory reply <e> <s> my noble friend asked about the regional and social fund and i can assure her that the government and indeed the community are examining the question of the restructuring of the community budget so that allocations from the social and regional fund will remain very much in line with our needs and we hope that the entire budget can be restructured <e>", "<cs> my lords that could be another very long answer but i think the question on the order paper refers to the help that can be obtained from the community and i hope that the noble lord would not wish me to go into my lengthy answer again <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that the unemployment rate in the united kingdom is substantially below that of at least two members of the european community <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not propose to attempt to reply on monetary policy but i do not think and the house would not agree that contributions from the eec of million from one fund and million from another fund are crumbs <e> <s> if the noble lord thinks that he must have quite a large appetite <e>", "<cs> my lords in some cases it supplements but in most of the cases to which i have referred it is a contribution to the united kingdom so that we may make the best use of our own resources <e>", "<cs> my lords i have tried to answer a number of different questions but i am afraid that the noble lords question while valid would probably be better directed to my noble friend lord trenchard who answers questions on industry <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has made the point very clearly <e> <s> i am very grateful to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the colour is immaterial <e> <s> the policy is what matters and we believe that this government have the right and the courageous policy and we intend to pursue it <e>", "<cs> my lords we do so already <e> <s> these matters are a constant preoccupation of the manpower services commission <e> <s> nevertheless both the msc and the government believe that there is scope for improving our national training arrangements for apprentices and others <e> <s> though some progress has been achieved in bringing our approach to skill-training up to date apprentice training retains many unsatisfactory features <e> <s> these issues are currently being studied by the government and the msc <e>", "<cs> my lords i had hoped that i had pointed out in my original answer that both the government and the manpower services commission were not totally satisfied with apprentice training <e> <s> indeed all parties in industry as well as the industry training boards are seeking methods of improving apprentice as well as adult training for relevant skills <e> <s> but i am sure that the noble lord and the house will appreciate that apprentice training is very much the employers responsibility <e> <s> therefore standards which have to be attained are very much at the behest of employers and industry itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly bring that point to the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e> <s> it is a rather detailed matter and therefore i shall bring it to his attention and if necessary i shall write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords that was not the only suggestion <e> <s> i believe that the main thrust is to improve the quality of apprentice training and certainly this government are looking to that as their main objective <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships always enjoy small and quiet verbal arguments especially across the floor of the house and especially when they do not come from this dispatch box <e>", "<cs> my lords i would go very far in agreeing with the noble lord lord byers <e> <s> i think that he and the house would agree that it is not the exclusive responsibility of employers indeed other parties have a major part to play in apprentice training <e> <s> i am not sure whether the noble lord lord scanlon is present today but his views play a very important part in apprentice training for the engineering industry training board <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who has undergone this form of apprenticeship i shall retain my own opinion on that matter but i think that a very sound form of apprenticeship is to speak in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not possible to provide a precise answer in the form which is requested by my noble friend as statistics are not kept on this basis <e> <s> but in the three-month period up to st october a total of million compensation was paid to firms claiming support under

noble friends second question the department is very grateful that this scheme at least is of some assistance <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i could not answer that question the noble lord might he satisfied and perhaps the house might be happier if i wrote to him giving that information <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures that i have given cover all payments under the temporary scheme but the method of payment is somewhat complicated <e>", "<cs> my lords i could not reply without notice to such an unconfirmed report but i do not think that we should be too precise over the figures <e> <s> possibly we shall find out <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe the noble lord mentioned or <e> <s> was that unemployed pounds or units of account <e> <s> i think that that question is probably a little wide of the question down in the name of my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder if the noble lord could ask a question <e> <s> we must get away from having a dialogue across the floor if the noble lord could ask a question very quickly we could have a written answer and we could adjourn <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend had introduced the order <e> <s> the noble lord lord donaldson and the noble and learned lord had given my noble friend a full list of their questions <e> <s> my noble friend has said he would write <e> <s> i just wondered whether the noble lord lord donaldson would not think that he is pressing my noble friend a little hard at this hour when my noble friend has given an undertaking that he will write and cover everything that he has said <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord trenchard i beg to introduce a bill to make provision with respect to deep sea mining operations and for purposes connected therewith <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords a draft directive which would liberalise the provision of insurance services across national frontiers within the european community has been under discussion in brussels for a considerable time <e> <s> until that directive is adopted the eec treaty permits member states to maintain their own national requirements for matters covered by the directive provided that those requirements are not discriminatory <e> <s> at present all member states restrict to some degree the freedom of their nationals to insure abroad <e> <s> the government are doing all they can to bring the negotiation of the insurance services directive to an early and successful conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for what my noble friend has said <e>

act and thirdly to consolidate all the fees for the statutory services provided by the company records office <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very grateful for the reception by the noble lord lord bruce of donington of these regulations <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned the microfiches <e> <s> i noticed that during the course of my remarks the microfiches even found their way over to the noble lord

microfiches in cardiff <e> <s> apparently they are all back but we can deal with that matter later <e>", "<cs> my lords i am so sorry <e> <s> the noble lord was typically precise and i apologise if i have been less precise than i should have been but i think he will accept one of the many fees as spelled out in the regulations <e> <s> i think that it appears on page <e> <s> i called it the fees and i am sorry if i was not precise <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all this evening i believe that the government and indeed the whole of your lordships house would like to thank and indeed should thank the european communities committee under the very able chairmanship of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords as a result of the relaxation of the telecommunications monopoly the user will be able to obtain from the market the terminal equipment he needs when he needs it at a competitive price <e> <s> secondly he will benefit from a considerable expansion in the range of equipment and services available as a wide range of manufacturers and others who are freed from the restrictions of monopoly are able to exploit advances in information technology and thirdly the stimulus of competition

that it is the intention of the government that the bill should proceed through this house during the course of this parliamentary session <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that my noble friend is approximately correct <e> <s> i think that at the moment approximately per cent of residential subscribers have an extension telephone which i think means more than one listening apparatus in the house <e> <s> so far as the expense is concerned certainly i do not believe that the united kingdom is at the bottom of the league in that respect or even in respect of delay in installing telephones <e> <s> but i am happy to confirm to my noble friend that it is the intention of the government and indeed of british telecom to improve the range of choice and indeed the efficiency of the

private organisations would be allowed under certain circumstances to attach various instruments to offices houses or other residences but the network the actual wiring which goes from one place to

house do now adjourn during pleasure until eight oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords on th february my right honourable friend the secretary of state for employment met miss joanna harris and three other employees of sandwell metropolitan borough council who had been threatened with dismissal if they did not join a trade union <e> <s> he reaffirmed his support for their refusal to give in to the councils tactics and restated his condemnation of the councils intolerant policy and noted that nalgo is also disregarding the tucs own guidance on the closed shop which urges tolerance <e> <s> my right honourable friend went on to explain how the law now operates since the passage of the employment act <e> <s> the government are currently reviewing the law on the closed shop in the green paper on trade union immunities <e> <s> developments at sandwell will be fully taken into account in the review <e>", "<cs> my lords may i reply to the noble lords questions in reverse order <e> <s> the government are reviewing trade union immunities so far as the closed shop is concerned in the green paper which is under discussion <e> <s> all of us are aware of the sense of outrage and indignation which this particular case has aroused all round the country <e> <s> the noble lord asked me about a surcharge on members of the council or on the council itself <e> <s> that is a hypothesis <e> <s> the question of a penalty or a fine will be taken up and decided by an industrial tribunal <e> <s> so far as we understand it miss harris has not yet gone to a tribunal <e> <s> that is her right <e>

lords i would not repudiate anything which my right honourable friend says <e> <s> far be it from me <e> <s> i am always tempted when noble lords quote from letters to say to them read on read on because very often such statements are taken out of context <e> <s> i do not think that the noble lord is doing that <e> <s> the noble lord asked me about fobbing off employees <e> <s> the employment act does no such thing <e> <s> that act strengthens the position of the employee <e> <s> under the act if an employees case is proved to be conclusively in the employees favour at the industrial tribunal that employee stands to gain a very large sum in compensation <e>", "<cs> my lords the law of this country and indeed the employment act does not entirely support everything that the noble lord has said <e> <s> we believe that the employment act has strengthened the position of each individual employee who wishes to work throughout industry in the united kingdom either in a union or outside it <e> <s> in this particular case miss harris wished to work for that authority <e> <s> when she entered employment her contract in no terms stated that she had to join a union and we believe that the employment act strengthens the right of miss harris and indeed the right of every similar worker <e>", "<cs> my lords i take my noble friends point but i hope he will accept that in the last resort this government and many others have recognised that no government and no law can force people to work together <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe the question of whether it is lawful or unlawful in this young ladys case has yet to be decided and indeed that is the very reason for which industrial tribunals exist <e> <s> it is they who decide whether or not the council has acted according to the law <e>", "<cs> that well may be my lords but i think the noble baroness will recognise that that is a different question from the one which i have been asked today <e>", "<cs> my lords the government share the feelings of your lordships house <e> <s> i understand that it is for the industrial tribunal to decide on the merits of the case and the industrial tribunal can require the employer to reinstate or re-employ the employee if the employees case is found to be justified <e> <s> i think that we should not pre-judge the case nor indeed should we go on with the duties of the industrial tribunal <e> <s> i understand the case will come up early next month and i think we should leave it at that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to be able to confirm that british airways

compare them with british airways figures <e> <s> in a recent survey in at least two respects british airways compared very favourably with all the transatlantic carriers especially in the field of technical developments and safety <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to my noble friends question lies in at least four different fields <e> <s> i wonder whether he will be satisfied if i write to him on the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i am reminded of the biblical term that one should render unto god what is due to god and unto caesar what is due to caesar <e> <s> we should render tribute to the

consultative committee of accountancy bodies <e> <s> the government agree that it is a very important item which ought to appear in every companys profit and loss account <e> <s> but the effect of the amendments which the noble lord lord bruce of donington has proposed extend a little beyond mere duplication of the requirement contained in paragraph <e> <s> if the item is inserted as an additional line into the profit and loss account formats which are formats and on pages and the government believe that there would be uncertainty as to whether or not the item was covered by the power given to companies by paragraph which also is on page <e> <s> this allows companies to combine together items in the profit and loss account and to show the breakdown only in a note to the accounts <e>", "<cs>

investments is meant to be helpful <e> <s> i hope that the words recognised stock exchange will give to my noble friend some indication of where the listing of the investments takes place <e>", "<cs>

lengthy discussion this afternoon on realisable <e> <s> it is perfectly clear to me what market value and stock exchange value mean <e> <s> i hope that i gave a partial explanation to the noble lord

consider everything that he has said <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord bruce has proposed this amendment and indeed we have also considered whether there seems to be any lack of clarity as to exactly what type of information is demanded by paragraph <e> <s> it has been put to us that it might be better to have separate information which would be required in respect of the items which are described under the two particular elements i and ii in sub-paragraph <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord bruce has pointed out that the use of the word provided in paragraph would make for some uncertainty and he has doubts about it <e> <s> it also seems that he has doubts as to whether or not the amounts in paragraph would be within the definition of provision <e> <s> the government agree that the applicability of the definition of provision for liability and charges to these particular items and indeed the implication for a proper balance sheet treatment requires a little further consideration

appropriate <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will accept that <e> <s> we do not want to clutter up the bill and to waste your lordships time with completely unnecessary amendments but we will take on board everything that the noble lord has said and if we deem it necessary we will bring an amendment forward to meet his point <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has moved these two amendments together and it seems that they are addressed to the particular parliamentary procedure which is applicable to the power provided by subsection <e> <s> clause gives power to the secretary of state to modify the accounting exemption provisions by statutory instrument <e> <s> these provisions are defined in sub-paragraph as the provisions of clauses to <e> <s> as we understand it the amendment which has just

power that he seeks in his amendment i understand already exists in clause of the bill which we were discussing a little earlier this evening <e> <s> my noble friend will find it at page of the bill at lines to <e> <s> this subsection already empowers the secretary of state to modify the accounting exemption provision by statutory instrument and by virtue of subsection of clause which is just above the original paragraph on page the accounting exemption provisions means all the provisions in clauses to and this naturally extends to amending the criteria in clause <e>", "<cs> it is apposite once again that i should <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to move other noble lords amendments for them <e> <s> i hope it is for the convenience of the committee if i speak to that amendment <e> <s> the amendment the noble lord has moved is in our opinion something of a retrograde one because we believe that the standards of training and of expertise required of an auditor of a company a company is a fairly specialised incorporated body with great privileges and we believe that an auditor of a limited company is someone who must employ the highest standards are the same as far as the auditor is concerned regardless of the size of the company whose accounts he is to audit <e> <s> i do not think anybody in the committee would suggest that a solicitor and i look carefully at the noble lord lord mishcon and indeed my noble friend lord noel-buxton who advises only private clients of whatever means or power would need a lower standard of qualification than one who advises large organisations or corporations <e> <s> i do not think anybody would hold that view <e> <s> i hope the same view would be held in regard to anybody auditing a limited company <e>", "<cs> did my noble friend wish to take both amendments together <e>", "<cs> it would suit the committee well to take the directors first <e> <s> we are grateful to my noble friend for moving this amendment which deals with a subject which has arisen in this house on earlier bills and is still a point at issue <e> <s> this subject has been raised by the law society for scotland <e> <s> the committee will see that section of the companies act requires the disclosure in the accounts of any transaction or arrangement other than any loans which are dealt with elsewhere in the act between any limited company and its director in which the director had any material interest whether direct or indirect <e> <s> taking one example of the provisions for disclosure we can see the contracts with the company for the employment of someones services or another example property transactions between any one person and a company <e> <s> disclosure of either of these points should reduce the risk of any misuse of company resources <e>", "<cs> i once again thank my noble friend for moving what he says is a very simple amendment <e> <s> i live in hope that this explanation may be a little briefer but more favourably received by him <e> <s> we accept that the purposes of section of the act are to require disclosure in matters of contracts which concern officers of the company <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend will accept that there are no <e>", "<cs> the proposals of the government to reform the legislation governing company names whether on first registration or at a subsequent change are contained in clauses and of this bill <e> <s> all these recognise the difficulties which have been experienced over so many years and have been expressed all round the committee tonight <e> <s> these have been experienced certainly since the act in seeking to apply the discretionary powers which are enshrined in section of the act <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend will appreciate that there are names now on the register <e> <s> this number is increasing by something in the region of new names every year <e>", "<cs> the noble lord was not rude but he has interrupted <e>", "<cs> thought i had made the position clear they are objections received by the registrar <e> <s> that is clear is it not <e>", "<cs> objections received on any grounds objections received by the registrar out of new names every year

hope that puts the figure i gave of objections by companies already on the register about their name or trademark being stolen removed or somehow threatened by a new interloper as to speak <e>", "<cs> among other things yes but it is not just the registrar it shows that the scale of objections and thus the scale of the problem is out of well over <e> <s> that is the main thrust of my argument and i am sure there are others which the noble lord lord mishcon with his facility would be able to adduce but i am advancing my argument on a fairly broad front and i hope the committee will bear with me while i attempt to complete my answer to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i wish that i could help my noble friend further but i do not think that there is much that i can say other than to suggest to him that the type or statutory size of a particular limited company could not be adduced from its name or from any letters that might follow the name <e> <s> the purpose of the companys name is to set it apart from other registered companies <e> <s> we have already gone into the question of likeness and similarity quite enough for this evening <e> <s> i fear that i do not think there is any method

amendment that i moved and were to insert the words which are in the marshalled list at the end to delete what is now in line and to insert the words in the manuscript amendment i think then the particular paragraph would make some sense because the paragraph would read <e>", "<cs> is my noble friend referring to the bill or the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think there are different prints of the bill <e> <s> the bill i have been working from tallies with what i have moved this afternoon <e>", "<cs> yes certainly <e> <s> the words i want to leave out are <e>", "<cs> i think it is the

dealt with by my noble friend the minister <e> <s> as far as the printing is concerned i accepted responsibility as a lord in waiting for your lordships house <e> <s> the department informed me that

way in which my noble friend has explained his amendment <e> <s> indeed we all but come to expect such clarity of lawyers and solicitors especially of my noble friend lord noel-buxton <e> <s> i am

be for the convenience of your lordships if the house were to resume in order to take a statement <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord wedderburn has moved his amendment in <e> <s> i think considerable hope at length and in considerable detail as we have come to expect from the noble lord but i wonder whether i could put to the committee one or two parallel thoughts that were not mentioned by the noble lord lord wedderburn <e> <s> first of all the purpose of clause which we are considering is not necessarily to introduce new grounds for disqualification <e> <s> i am sure that if the noble lord will consider clause he will see that it covers much of the ground that is already stated in section of the act <e> <s> also we hope that clause will streamline the existing procedures for disqualifying those persons who are already liable under section of the act and under section of the companies act <e>", "<cs> in replying to the noble lord lord monson far be it from me to curtail his tour of the major companies of our economy nor indeed to take issue with the noble lord lord lloyd about what he calls glossy advertisements <e>

but i would suggest the average investor is pleased to see the performance of his company set out in detail and in pictorial form which is easily visible and easily digestible <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord lord lloyd is right in criticising any company whatever its size for making its affairs more legible and more agreeable to the public and indeed to its shareholders <e>", "<cs> may i respectfully suggest to the noble lord just one word patience <e> <s> i am coming to his views and especially when i am allowed to proceed in replying to the noble lord lord monson <e> <s> in considering this amendment i hope the committee will allow the government to state their view on whether it really is a proper function of company law to regulate such details of the administration of companies <e> <s> very often these details may be important as the noble lord lord monson said <e> <s> nevertheless they are details and <e>", "<cs> i hope that i shall not take any time from the noble lord lord monson but the noble lord lord bruce made various criticisms of my reply <e> <s> i have nothing to add <e> <s> my case rests <e> <s> as regards the glossy brochures the noble lord lord mancroft is far more eloquent than i as regards the amendment of the noble lord lord monson the government do not treat the noble lords views with flippancy but i hope i managed to suggest to the noble lord that we believe that company law and this bill is not necessarily the best method of achieving what he wants <e> <s> we believe that the law should not compel companies but it should not go out of its way to make difficulties for any companies which wish to aid their shareholders <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very grateful to the noble lord lord strabolgi for his kind remarks and for forgiving the clerical error regarding the date when the amendment order will come into operation <e> <s> the noble lord asked me two questions <e> <s> i am informed by my noble friend the minister that this order has been passed by another place <e> <s> the second question which the noble lord lord strabolgi asked me was one which i had intended to inquire into <e> <s> i understand that the number of cases which have occurred over the last few years have averaged between five and <e> <s> if therefore we say that they can be counted on the fingers of two hands i think we shall be reasonably accurate <e> <s> perhaps however i may inquire into the precise number of cases which have occurred and write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may take the last speaker first and thank my noble friend for his support <e> <s> of course it is interesting that the first three speakers on this amendment should perhaps have to declare an interest in this matter since i understand that my noble friend and lord bruce and myself are all members of various august bodies which have to do with the specialist presentation of these matters <e> <s> the main thrust of these four amendments was put forward by the noble lord lord bruce as he has pointed out at an earlier stage <e> <s> i think he quoted certainly one column number but if the noble lord would look at column of our proceedings at an earlier stage i think he will find there the same point moved by himself previously and my reply to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i await with eagerness the intimation of the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may assist with the point raised by my noble friend lord morris i am sure that there are terms which have been in use for many years and which explain the position very clearly <e> <s> these four amendments are very much in accord with the fourth directive which of course is what we are implementing in this bill <e> <s> perhaps i may take further advice on the points raised by my noble friend and if i find that there is a major point i will communicate with him in writing before the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords as always we are grateful to the noble lord lord bruce for moving this amendment which we recognise is intended to shed a little light on quite a thorny problem that has afflicted the accountancy profession and indeed the presentation of accounts in this particular area <e> <s> the purpose of this amendment seems to be to alleviate the alleged inconsistency between an accounting standard that deals with the accounting treatment of stock and work in progress and what is found in paragraph of schedule to the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that there is consistency between my noble and learned friend and myself on this point <e> <s> i think i have been most accommodating at least i trust so <e> <s> in dealing with amendment no <e> <s> we look forward to consulting further with the accountancy bodies <e> <s> i have said that it is the true and fair view that must predominate and i hope that the noble lord will accept that this particular method of valuing stock which may or may not be appropriate should be included <e> <s> as i said the fourth directive requires that methods of valuing stock should be explicit and not implicit <e> <s> i think everything i have said is consistent <e> <s> i think i have been accommodating and i hope the noble lord will accept the concept that we have held this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble lord lord bruce would accept that the government believe that this amendment does not add anything to the present meaning of paragraph <e> <s> paragraph refers to the historical cost accounting rules and sub-paragraph follows immediately with the words those rules <e> <s> clearly to everybody accountants and non-accountants this is a reference to the historical cost accounting rules <e> <s> therefore i hope the noble lord will accept that the proposed change is unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very grateful for the kindness shown by the noble lord lord bruce and indeed i am instructed that this amendment which he has put forward has been met by amendments nos <e> <s> and to which i have spoken <e> <s> nevertheless we thank the noble lord lord bruce <e>", "<cs> we are grateful for the support of the noble lord lord bruce for the amendment i have moved <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that once one <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that amendments nos <e> <s> and which are in the names of the noble lord lord bruce of donington and the noble lord lord ponsonby are covered by the amendments to which i have just spoken nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> with that very brief explanation i hope that the noble lord lord bruce may be satisfied <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very grateful to the noble lord lord bruce for moving this amendment <e> <s> i hope that it will be to the convenience of the house and the noble lord lord bruce if i attempt to deal with the six amendments three to clause and three to clause together <e> <s> i noted what the noble lord lord bruce said about taking legal advice <e> <s> as he is no doubt aware the government also took legal advice <e> <s> once both the noble lord and the government take legal advice there is no knowing where we might end up <e> <s> the noble lord said these are plain drafting amendments and that he hopes they will clarify some aspects in particular clauses and of the bill <e> <s> our legal advice is that for reasons which i think i should briefly explain to the noble lord the existing drafting is to be preferred <e>", "<cs> my lords i can hardly be surprised that there is no member of your lordships house who wishes to follow into the intricate discussion the noble lord lord bruce has set before us as to the duties of auditors although all that he said was very relevant <e> <s> i wonder whether he is correct in thinking that the auditors risk is any less in carrying out a positive duty as opposed to a negative duty <e> <s> if an auditor expresses an opinion and his opinion is found to be ill-founded as the noble lord knows and indeed i know the legal profession are on to him fairly quickly <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear to tread down the same path as we trod at the committee stage but we have certainly been over some of these arguments before although as the noble lord lord monson will remember at an earlier stage we had all sorts of extraneous discussions as to whether glossy reports should or should not be sent out at the companys expense to the shareholders each year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am advised by the manpower services commission which is responsible for operating the youth opportunities programme that there are no plans to extend the length of work experience on employers premises schemes in agriculture and other allied industries beyond six months <e> <s> the main purpose of a work experience scheme is to provide unemployed young people with a realistic introduction to working life and this can normally be satisfactorily completed within six months <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all very grateful for the help which my noble friend gives to the youth opportunities scheme <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend and the house noted that in my reply i said that work experience on employers premises schemes can normally be satisfactorily completed within six months <e> <s> but there are of course exceptions <e> <s> i am advised that in all cases flexibility is encouraged by the department <e> <s> i hope this is so in the cases which have been mentioned by my noble friend <e> <s> we all realise that depending upon when a young person starts work in an agricultural <e>", "<cs> my lords that is possibly a trifle far from agriculture <e> <s> however i shall certainly endeavour to convey the noble lords comments to my right honourable friend given the pipes of pan among shepherd boys <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> i should first remind your lordships that this bill deals with a number of different subjects <e> <s> it also deals with the subject of lloyds <e> <s> i am a member of lloyds <e> <s> the bill deals with the supervision of insurance companies generally <e> <s> two of the clauses in the bill touch upon lloyds <e> <s> however these two clauses do little more than repeat the provisions of the lloyds general business regulations and also the insurance transfer of general business regulations <e> <s> they only apply to lloyds as a whole some financial and other requirements that the bill in earlier clauses applies to insurance companies <e> <s> having said that i hope that your lordships will see no difficulty in my speaking on behalf of the government to the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all of us are grateful for the benign and charming reception that this bill has received from your lordships this afternoon and especially in view of the detailed explanation which i gave i regret that my preliminary comments were considerably in excess of the joint comments of these two experts one of whom is a broker and another an eminent chartered accountant speaking from the liberal benches and the opposition benches <e> <s> but i <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think the government would flinch from saying that probably there might be others so the blame might not be totally on those two or more member states <e> <s> be that as it may many difficulties have been put in the path of the directive <e> <s> it is a very welcome development that the council of ministers has taken a close interest in the directive <e> <s> at the meeting of the council of ministers in march last the council of finance ministers confirmed the great importance of implementing the freedom of services and the need to make more rapid progress <e> <s> those terms we have heard in relation to all sorts of legislation both in this house and elsewhere <e> <s> nevertheless if the council of ministers uses such terms then at least the onward march of the services directive is beginning to gather steam <e>", "<cs> my lords have i not heard <e>", "<cs> i apologise my lords <e> <s> i am sure it would be desirable that actuaries should act as an auditor might act when he is looking at the accounts of a company and i hope that actuaries will continue to carry out their duties on an annual not a triennial basis <e> <s> i understand that at present they examine the assets of long-term life companies on an annual basis in most cases and the government would consider it desirable that actuaries should continue to carry out their duties as they see fit on an annual basis <e>", "<cs> one of the great pleasures of this particular stage of the bill is that comments have been addressed from all round the committee to my noble friend the minister and we can surprise noble lords in that i am allowed to reply to the amendment <e> <s> i hope the noble lord lord ross allow me to deal briefly with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i was not too sure whether he wished to deal with amendments nos <e> <s> and together or whether no <e> <s> stands on its own <e> <s> i accept that they both deal with approximately the same point <e>", "<cs> certainly we would never claim that any orders which would come to be made under this particular provision would be a matter of great moment but we do believe that there is a very strong case for maintaining the modest degree of some parliamentary control over the order-making procedure which the clause provides for at present <e> <s> when this bill was first introduced in another place the clause provided a significant restriction on the secretary of states discretion in that the only factor he was allowed to take into account in deciding whether or not to alter the prescribed sum was inflation or to be accurate and to use the words of the clause as it was in another place a change in the value of money <e> <s> but by the time the bill reached your lordships house that restriction had been removed <e> <s> we felt it made a useful improvement to the bill <e> <s> i am sure it would not surprise the noble lord lord ross and his noble friends on those benches that this restriction was removed as a result of an opposition amendment but we felt this was something which improved the bill and we accepted it <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that in my young parliamentary career i have before had such a wonderful invitation that maybe the noble lord lord ross of marnock might applaud me <e> <s> however i can say quite honestly that he has done exactly what i did when i first looked at the clause walked right into a major trap <e> <s> in all humility i applaud the noble lord lord ross because i did it myself and the department cheered and said that i was not quite accurate <e>", "<cs> i have not finished yet <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord does so i should like to tell him that on the figures he gave us the <e>", "<cs> we are always a bit apprehensive when the noble baroness lady phillips leaps across i must not say hadrians wall and assists your lordships in considering scottish matters <e> <s> i hope that she and above all the noble lord lord ross may bear with me while i attempt to explain some of the points that have been raised and to answer some of the questions which have arisen during the course of discussing this amendment <e> <s> this amendment seeks to exclude completely central heating installations from rate valuations <e> <s> to do this would be a major departure from the basic principles of domestic valuation <e>", "<cs> i am sure we are all grateful for the clear way in which the noble viscount has moved his amendment <e> <s> the committee will be aware that this amendment was tabled fairly late but that is through no fault of the noble viscount <e> <s> it is similar i think almost identical to a provision which was enacted in the water bill for england and wales about a month or <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government have today filed with the european court of human rights their observations on the further written observations of the applicants <e> <s> there is and has been no question of the government asking for a postponement and i must point out that if the applicants counsel has not asked for additional time to submit further written observations the proceedings would have been concluded as soon as those concerned had answered the questions which were put to them by the court at the end of the oral hearing <e> <s> the government for their part submitted their answers well within the time limit set by the court <e>", "<cs> my lords we are always pleased to receive congratulations from whatever quarter of the house and we are grateful to my noble friend for his comments <e>", "<cs> no on both counts my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it is the governments duty to come between the tuc and various other parties who wish to take their case to the european court <e> <s> the answer to the other two questions the noble lord put to me is no <e>", "<cs> my lords much of what my noble friend said may be true but it is certainly not the governments fault since the government are in the position of replying to any submissions that have been requested both by the court and the applicants <e>", "<cs> the noble lord was good enough to speak to three amendments in clause <e> <s> he has explained very lucidly and is entirely correct in mentioning the british telecom monopoly in terms of the running of the system and not necessarily in dealing with particular services as such <e> <s> i hope he would accept that there are a number of places in the bill where we believe it is much more easily understood if one refers to what we call the provision of services rather than the running of systems <e>", "<cs> this is indeed a question of definition and semantics and i will certainly give my noble friend an undertaking that i will consult my advisers and get in touch with him about these queries before the next stage or during the next stage <e>", "<cs> i listened carefully to what the noble lord lord lloyd had to say and i took careful note <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> the committee will have listened with attention to the detailed way in which the noble lord lord jacques proposed his amendments <e> <s> the noble lord has pointed out that the subject of these amendments was discussed in another place about a month or six weeks ago <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to all three noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> perhaps i may first take up a particular point which was raised by the noble lord lord bruce <e> <s> he mentioned two major aspects of the work of life assurance companies and he particularly referred to the investment policy <e> <s> i think that what the noble lord lord bruce was suggesting was that the actuary would carry out his duties in studying the solvency of the company and i agree with the noble lord that the actuary can only work along his own professional guidelines <e> <s> indeed as the noble lord has pointed out accountants were referred to as archaeologists <e> <s> certainly the government would not want actuaries to carry out work in such a way as to be considered students of the crystal ball and to be involved in soothsaying and foretelling the future <e> <s> i believe that the actuarys duty is fairly broad and well laid down by the guidelines issued by the professional institutions and we consider that this should be dealt with between the actuaries and the professional institutions <e> <s> it is certainly for the actuaries to act if they are dissatisfied with the flow of information coming from the company either in a particular case or in general <e> <s> we believe that it is a matter for the profession to regulate for itself <e>", "<cs> the noble lords amendment may deal on a very broad scale with the protection of policyholders but the actual thrust of the amendment is entirely on what information should be disclosed and should be demanded by the actuary from the company <e> <s> i think that is a little narrower than the entire field of the protection of policyholders <e>", "<cs> yes as always <e>", "<cs> the committee will be very grateful to the noble lord lord banks for speaking to his two amendments which as he pointed out are technical <e> <s> i hope that the committee will bear with me because they are very complicated and somewhat difficult to understand although i think that they fall into the bill in a fairly logical form <e>", "<cs> i should like to attempt to reply to the noble lords who have spoken in the order in which they spoke <e> <s> i should like to attempt to reply very briefly first to the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> the noble lord informed the committee that he had been in touch with the life offices association and the british insurance association and he said that they had indicated their full support for these amendments <e> <s> the information that i had was that the opposition was not so total as in such a letter as the noble lord lord bruce might have but that there were one or at the most two companies which still found some difficulty in this matter <e> <s> i think that this matter is very germane to the point raised by my noble friend lord oneill <e>", "<cs> of course the whole committee will never be surprised to hear the robust comments of the noble lord lord bruce with his great knowledge of the affairs of the european parliament and indeed european institutions <e> <s> i am not entirely sure to which directive the noble lord refers but if it is the one which the noble lord normally raises on these occasions we might call it bruces hobbyhorse i am given to understand that this particular animal has made certain strides forward <e> <s> perhaps i may consider what the noble lord has said and write to him a little more expeditiously than i did following the last occasion on which i promised to write to him and indeed the noble lord lord banks <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank all my noble friends and indeed the noble lords lord lloyd of kilgerran and lord davies of leek for the fascinating discussion that we have had <e> <s> i hope that it will be permissible to take these four amendments together the two spoken to by the noble lord lord lloyd and <e>", "<cs> i shall reply briefly to the point raised by the noble lord lord davies <e> <s> from my nonscientific description of laser which i gave to the noble lord and indeed to the committee i think he will find that the definition of lasers as we have used them in committee this afternoon is covered by the words to be found in line on page of the bill clause electro-magnetic <e> <s> further down the noble lord will find in paragraphs <e>", "<cs> i am not entirely sure to which clause the noble lord refers <e> <s> was he referring to clause <e>", "<cs> i was referring to both clauses and and subsection i in both clauses simultaneously <e> <s> i am advised i hope that this may bear some relevance to the query raised by my noble friend lord torphichen that those lasers which are used entirely on a single set of premises are exempt from the monopoly by virtue of clause i <e>", "<cs> we discussed this matter at some length when dealing with amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i must apologise to my noble friend in that i have no separate note on the difference between perceiving and receiving in the human eye <e> <s> however subject to any assurance i can give him to the effect that the clause as drafted covers the points that were raised in committee if there is any logical or drafting matter here perhaps my noble friend will permit me to get in touch with him before the next stage of the bill <e> <s> i suspect the answer will be more than esoteric but i am afraid i do not have the esoteric answer with me this afternoon <e>", "<cs> it would appear that the wish of the noble lord lord glenamara and the purpose of his amendment is to build into the bill a limitation that we simply do not find in the act but which is indeed at present laid upon british telecom through its authorisation to license from the secretary of state <e> <s> we believe that that would be a retrograde step and an unfortunate one too for in effect the amendment would require all licences to be renewed after not more than years or perhaps even to lapse <e> <s> furthermore the amendment would take away the discretion of the secretary of state <e> <s> we believe that it would create some uncertainty which would be very undesirable in some particular cases that i shall enumerate later <e> <s> any uncertainty and the removal of discretion is the opposite of what is needed if any liberalisation is to be effective <e>", "<cs> i wondered whether the noble lord had concluded his remarks or was drawing his remarks to a close because i have one or two comments which i should like to make before the noble lord decides how he will deal with his amendment and it may be that it would be convenient if i were to make them now <e>", "<cs> i would require to take further guidance on whether a private limited company was the same term as an individual but i could not add anything to that <e> <s> i did say that an irrevocable licence would not be granted to an individual <e> <s> licences issued to an individual will have a time limit <e> <s> i said that <e> <s> as to whether an individual is classified as a private limited company i do not think i would want to define that immediately but i could write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i must admit that my noble friend is leading me and i suggest some members of the committee down a fascinating path as to the lifting of restrictions upon individuals being a licence or not <e> <s> i do not necessarily accept his drafting and legal point at the moment <e> <s> possibly we might return to it and we might read what all of us have said on this point <e> <s> i am advised that when i mentioned individual that includes a company or group of companies <e> <s> i hope that that will help the noble lord lord glenamara <e> <s> also i am advised that general licences may be as i call it irrevocable or as perhaps the noble lord lord lloyd calls it irrevocable <e> <s> we shall have to consult the dictionary to see who is correct <e> <s> i am given to understand that licences to individual companies will be subject to time limits therefore they will not be irrevocable <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should have replied to my noble friend <e> <s> i think that it was the noble lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> i must apologise to my noble friend <e> <s> nowhere in clause does it say irrevocably and we connect the word individual either as a company or as a group of companies <e> <s> the query he had was covered <e> <s> so far as all the answers i have given and i have given three if not four answers to the noble lord lord glenamara in trying to answer his point i think i have covered licences to individual companies <e> <s> these will not be irrevocable <e> <s> then going back i said that the word individual included a company or a group of companies <e> <s> i said that general licences may be either revocable or irrevocable <e> <s> i do not know what other cases the noble lord might have had <e>", "<cs> if the noble lords direct question is not covered by what i have given in the course of my reply <e>", "<cs> as always <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now considered on report <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house will be grateful for the general and enthusiastic welcome given to this order this afternoon <e> <s> if i may i will thank my noble friend for his very kind welcome and his kind remarks about the individuals he mentioned and the services that they have rendered to this beautiful island and to the outer islands in past years <e> <s> i am afraid that i am unable to tell him at this stage what will be the future plans as to the grand link of car ferries in the outer isles <e> <s> i understand that this particular order is to authorise the construction of an access road slipway and a fendering system on each side of the sound of berneray which is very much needed as my noble friend pointed out and also to provide facilities for a new ferry between the islands of berneray and north uist <e> <s> i shall certainly endeavour to find out what are the plans for the future of such a system if there be such plans <e>", "<cs> we are very grateful to my noble friend for moving his amendment so briefly and so succinctly <e> <s> the house is always grateful when one of your lordships attempts to clarify any legislation <e> <s> i was interested that my noble friend added a touch of conservative philosophy when he spoke about giving greater freedom <e> <s> but i hope my noble friend will understand that despite his intention to shorten and clarify the wording of subsection the amendment is a little faulty <e>", "<cs> my noble friend seems to have a point in that he believes that there is a clash between subsection and clause <e>", "<cs> it seems that there is concern about clause <e> <s> when i first looked at clause in conjunction with clause <e>", "<cs> i am sure that we all understand my noble friends concern about advertisements especially that the power to require any information which has to be included in the advertisement of telecommunications apparatus should extend to any kind of advertisement because i think that any kind of advertisement is included in subsection in advertisements of any description <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that subsection is something of a definition subsection in that many of us including my noble friend might think that advertisements of any description might have referred to advertisements in subsection which i mentioned and to <e>", "<cs> the noble lord doth tempt me and i believe that he tempts the entire committee to remain here until i am certainly over pensionable age by the time we have sorted through every definition of advertisement and indeed every statute which contains a definition of the word advertisement <e> <s> the earlier remarks i made about the trade descriptions act are especially relevant and i hope that that deals with the particular point at issue which was raised by my noble friend <e> <s> i hope that by reproducing in this bill the relevant section from the trade description act we shall meet the particular case <e> <s> if the noble lord lord avebury were to glance at the printing in the margin at the bottom of page of the bill on the right hand side he would see <e>", "<cs> it might seem or might not seem surprising that the government propose leaving out an entire clause of the bill and i shall try to explain why we believe this to be necessary <e> <s> at the same time i wish to speak to a series of amendments namely amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> these are all drafting amendments and i propose to give a brief explanation of the situation <e>", "<cs> interventions from my noble friend are always welcome in this committee whatever the hour of day or night <e> <s> i hope that what i may have to say may go some way to satisfying him and the committee <e> <s> we appreciate my noble friends efforts to improve the clarity and drafting of this bill but i think that he and the committee may agree with me that by his amendment we are going a little far since it is i understand laid down that bts auditors must belong to one of the bodies recognised for the purposes of section <e>", "<cs> i would hope that they are not but i understand that section of the act is the master section as far as this particular provision in clause is concerned <e> <s> i understand that all the bodies mentioned in section are allowed to carry out the audit of bt <e>", "<cs> the committee will always take note of relevant and forceful comments from my noble friend lord mottistone <e> <s> indeed we take note of them <e> <s> the winged messengers have sent a brief rejoinder to the remarks of my noble friend lord morris <e> <s> i am informed that the bodies which are listed in the post office act are indeed those which are listed in section of the act <e> <s> i hope that that may satisfy him on that particular point <e>", "<cs> but section applies to this bill and that is the master section <e>", "<cs> i have an apology to make to the committee <e> <s> it is indeed one of a plethora of amendments that i spoke to <e> <s> i am grateful to the observant watchdog who goes by the name of my noble friend lord mottistone for pointing this out <e> <s> i apologise to the committee <e> <s> indeed this was one of eight amendments <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has sought to explain the reasons for his amendment and i understand that he spoke to both amendment and amendment <e> <s> as far as no <e> <s> is concerned it may appear to be innocent certainly nobody would ever accuse my noble friend of being simple he tends to do his homework as the committee will have observed in the long days we have been discussing this bill but i believe that that amendment the first amendment at least would make nonsense of subsection of clause <e> <s> paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole house will be very grateful indeed very interested to have heard the noble lord lord bruce proposing the amendment which as he points out is marginally different from the amendment and the similar new clause which was proposed by his noble friend lord jacques at an earlier stage in the bill <e> <s> indeed a similar new clause to the one that was proposed in committee and similar proposals of that type were considered in committee and at the report stage in another place <e> <s> therefore i think that the house indeed all of us would consider that this matter which has been explained by the noble lord lord bruce tonight and indeed at an earlier stage by the noble lord lord jacques has received very considerable and detailed attention <e> <s> certainly none of us would quarrel with that <e> <s> the appointed actuary plays a very important indeed a crucial role in respect of the company to which he is appointed <e> <s> he depends very much on the information which he is given <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment which has been moved by the noble lord as he will know and as no doubt the house will have observed seeks to delete from the local government planning and land act the enabling power to allow charges to be made for planning applications in scotland <e> <s> the system of fees for planning applications is based on the principle that local authority expenditure should in appropriate cases be offset by the charging of reasonable fees for local authority services <e> <s> the government consider it appropriate that the cost to local authorities of development control should be offset in this way so that the burden is shared between the developer and the community <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all fascinated to hear from the honourary president of the scottish football association about the doings of queens park but i hope the fanatics of the game will not care to read the noble lords remarks about third and second division <e> <s> that would go down well north of the border <e> <s> perhaps they might care to read his remarks just as they read those of us on this side of the house but i think not <e> <s> the noble lords remarks are on the record and we shall look forward to examining them tomorrow with great care <e>", "<cs> my lords i had the feeling that the noble lord lord hughes was attempting to lead me indeed he may well be leading me down a slippery slope towards a major trap as far as the particular activities of architects are concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the noble lords word <e> <s> however i am sure that the noble lord will see all the way through the particular paragraph that the local authority may vary consent <e> <s> i think that the main reply to his query is contained in the words <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment moved eloquently by lord thurso is identical to one he moved at an earlier stage of the bill <e> <s> we have therefore discussed it at some length but i hope he will find my remarks on the subject tonight a little different and that they may satisfy him rather more than he felt was the result of my reply at the earlier stage <e> <s> the governments position has never been negative indeed we are actively considering how the law in scotland should be changed but there are good reasons why action immediately would not be justified and i shall explain the reasons albeit briefly <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not want to go any further than to say unless some difficulty arises from the consultations that are under way at the moment <e> <s> i do not think that the noble viscount would want us to select any idea which might arise in our minds and suggest that that should be the main stumbling block to enacting the legislation <e> <s> we do not think that there will be any major difficulty but we still have to allow for the possibility of some major difficulty arising in the consultations <e> <s> however i think that i have given a very firm commitment that we intend to meet the intention behind the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly the government do not do things of this ilk <e> <s> i am totally lost as to what the noble lord is seeking but certainly not <e>", "<cs> i think it might be convenient if we resume the house now to take other business <e> <s> i understand that the target which has been agreed through the usual channels is eight oclock <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords letters containing offers of recurrent grant were issued on th june <e>", "<cs> my lords the government sympathise with and appreciate the concern that has been expressed at the uncertainty which has been caused by the delay to which my noble friend referred <e> <s> i would stress however that the department has treated very sympathetically any cases of hardship caused by the delay <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for those kind comments <e> <s> indeed i recall that when i was in his position in the house i used to have to try to decipher a great deal of gobbledygook <e> <s> i too found the subject matter fascinating but i was more fortunate than the noble lord lord wallace in that i had a speaking brief prepared together with the legislation and copies of what had been discussed in this house and in another place <e> <s> however i am glad the noble lord has found the order acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand it has been agreed through the usual channels that we should take a dinner break now <e> <s> i therefore beg to move that further consideration of the bill on report be adjourned until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord morris has already said my noble friend the minister lord trefgarne attempted to give an explanation to my noble friend at an earlier stage about this amendment <e> <s> the word expedient in this case could be construed as narrower than the phrase requisite advantageous or convenient <e> <s> while the government have no wish to narrow the powers of british telecom the advice we have received makes us unable to accept the addition which my noble friend seeks to make to the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend said this subject was raised in committee and as the house may be aware my noble friends proposal would require british telecom or a wholly-owned subsidiary to obtain the consent of my right honourable friend the secretary of state before it issued any shares stocks or other interest to a nominee of british telecom itself or to one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries <e> <s> the definition of a wholly-owned subsidiary of another body corporate which we find in section of the companies act means that even if shares in a wholly-owned subsidiary of british telecom are transferred to a nominee of that company or to a wholly-owned subsidiary that company remains a wholly-owned subsidiary subject to the same controls under the bill <e> <s> there is thus no need for the secretary of states consent to be required <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has in cricketing parlance howled me something of a tricky and fast ball <e> <s> i shall answer with a dead bat and say that if my noble friends wishes cannot be met i shall certainly endeavour to see what can be done <e> <s> i hope he will agree that i should write to him on the last part of his query <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord morris has this afternoon added to the very lucid account which he gave at the committee stage <e> <s> i hope that he will not expect me to go further into a definitive opinion on a matter as intricate as european economic <e>", "<cs> my lords first i owe my noble friend apologies for not getting in touch with him <e> <s> he and the whole house know that we have had more than enough time and opportunity to be in touch with each other both formally and informally since the last stage <e> <s> i shall also have to apologise to my noble friend for the fair length of my reply to his very relevant and well-constructed amendments <e> <s> but i hope that what i have to say will provide even greater clarity in the perception or reception of what we are discussing today <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very grateful to my noble friend lord mottistone for moving his amendments so clearly and for being so helpful in giving us all the references to the comments of my noble friend the minister lord trefgarne at an earlier stage in the bill <e> <s> i have listened carefully to what my noble friend has said hoping that it ties up with what was said and is more or less parallel with what was said at an earlier stage <e> <s> i hope that he and the house agree that the first amendment sought by my noble friend would oblige my right honourable friend the secretary of state to consult with other bodies than british telecom when making decisions on the licensing of any systems or apparatus and also when approving standards or apparatus for connection to the public network <e>", "<cs> my lords may i take the first point and reply to my noble friend lord mottistone <e> <s> i am advised as indeed i hope i had said that there is no specific provision in clauses and to oblige the secretary of state to consult but on the other hand there is nothing specifically to prevent him consulting with whomsoever he chooses <e> <s> i think that would go some way towards disposing of the question which was raised by my noble friend lord morris as to forcing the secretary of state to consult various bodies <e> <s> i think it might also be relevant to the question asked by the noble baroness lady phillips at an earlier stage in that if we put in one body there would be at least a hundred possibly a thousand who would also fit into that category at some special time who would require to be consulted or might feel that they should be consulted <e> <s> i hope we can take it that the wording of clauses and is permissive and will not do anything to impinge on proper and valid consultation where relevant by the secretary of state with interested bodies who feel they have a relevant case to put to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that this may be a convenient moment to move that further consideration of this bill on report be adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords as i am sure my noble friend will be aware the relaxation of the monopoly is indeed the policy of the government <e> <s> we believe that it is right that the secretary of state who is answerable to parliament should be responsible for granting the main licences in the strategic sense that will make a reality of liberalisation and indeed which will define its principal directions <e> <s> most of these cardinal licences will be general licences that are granted under this clause and others which will give everybody the right to run a system of a specified kind <e>", "<cs> my lords we should need to take great care in defining the areas <e> <s> my noble friend talked about general areas in respect of clause <e>", "<cs> my lords it is clear from my noble friends speech and from various comments of other noble lords that there is still some misunderstanding about the exact scope and purpose of subsection <e> <s> i hope that in the course of my brief remarks i shall be able to alleviate some of the concern that is felt about this subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords before i attempt to reply to the amendment which has been moved by my noble friend lord mottistone or indeed attempt to put any quantity upon the penalty for the total delays in one year of british telecom or words to that effect we shall certainly be able to garner it from the <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of the five amendments which have been spoken to by my noble friend would i understand be to give to british telecom an exemption from liability in tort only for unreasonable actions which are covered by clause <e> <s> thus presumably if british telecom caused a person loss or damage when acting reasonably in such cases it could be held liable <e> <s> i appreciate that the tort of negligence which is the one we are mainly concerned with in this case is primarily concerned with what we call unreasonable actions <e> <s> it has been described somewhat irreverently as leaving undone those things which ought to have been done and doing those things which ought not have been done <e> <s> i am sure that will help my noble friend lord morris it is beginning to help me anyhow <e> <s> however i am advised that this is not invariably the case my quotation does not always match up with what the noble lord seeks to apply in clause <e> <s> therefore we think it would be very strange to give british telecom an exemption for its unreasonable actions but not for its reasonable ones however remote the chance might be of a case brought in this latter example <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe this amendment proposes that in the event of the government going so far as to withhold their consent or approval from british telecoms application for any long-term finance in the money markets the secretary of state should write to british telecom giving the reasons for a particular decision <e> <s> if any amendment is required and i would remind the house as i am sure my noble friend is aware that the government have recently announced an increase in british telecoms external financing limit for this is agreed with the business as a matter of general policy not as a special decision on whether a particular loan will or will not obtain government consent <e>", "<cs> my lords it was i who explained to my noble friend at that late hour in our deliberations that section of the companies act does not supersede or in any way replace section <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the house will appreciate the efforts of my noble friend to add clarity to the bill tonight <e> <s> of course we accept my noble friends wish that the bill should include nothing that is excessive and indeed that he wishes to cut any unnecessary verbiage from the bill and above all to see that it is as short and as understandable as possible <e> <s> but i hope my noble friend may be able to accept that his drafting is not adequate in this particular case <e> <s> the proviso subject to any terms of the agreement to the contrary has to qualify the verb shall as in line on page of the bill and the amendment simply cannot be construed in a way that is consistent with what is in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand it has been agreed through the usual channels that this might be a convenient place to adjourn consideration of the bill on report <e> <s> i see my noble friend who will have further information on this <e>", "<cs> my lords we have listened with great care to the arguments put forward by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that amendment no <e> <s> c was inserting one or two conditions into the clause and the noble lord especially mentioned clause <e> <s> i hope i gave the assurance that it is our intention that licences issued to individuals must be in writing <e> <s> that certainly would be the practice of my right honourable friend when issuing licences <e> <s> i am advised that amendment no <e> <s> c would be otiose and that it is not necessary in the bill in that we shall be insisting upon this <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave i would repeat that my instructions are that it is not necessary <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government fully subscribe to the general principles contained in international labour organisation convention no <e> <s> employment policy convention to which ilo recommendation no <e> <s> is a useful supplement <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bruce of donington mentioned by name the manpower services commission and their forecast but the special employment measures which are being undertaken by the government in the current year will receive approximately billion and that will not be a mere fleabite <e> <s> i would also add that the youth opportunities programme alone will be assisting more than young people in the present year which is a major improvement over the last two years <e> <s> i think that that in itself is an adequate response to the queries of the experts <e>", "<cs> in one word my lords no <e>", "<cs> my lords the policies of education run hand in hand with the youth opportunities programme <e> <s> certainly so far as the question posed by the noble baroness is directed at youth opportunities in general and unemployment it can be answered by the fact that government policies are first to reduce inflation which in itself will produce stable employment opportunities once we have conquered inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i might draw the noble lords attention to paragraph of article in the convention where i think the noble lord will find these words <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a helpful question for which i thank the noble lord <e> <s> indeed we are doing that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for support from my noble friend and indeed from all quarters of the house but i think that is going just a margin wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think so <e> <s> i do have a document which relates to every country which has ratified conventions since which was a little before my time <e> <s> no doubt the noble lord could tell us that the policy is the same and has remained the same in the ilo ever since then <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that again is a little wide of the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords before i reply to the very interesting and substantive points raised by my noble friend lord ferrier and most amusingly and charmingly by other noble lords all round the house i may commence by reciting to my noble friend one of the lines in the national anthem of france <e>", "<cs> my lords during the examination of the draft directive in brussels the british representatives are continuing to press for the inclusion of a state of the art defence on the lines explained by my noble and learned friend the lord advocate on th november last year <e> <s> this would i think cover the risks which the noble lord has in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will know far better than many noble lords how many are the complex issues involved in the entire concept of product liability and in the directive itself <e> <s> the government are continuing discussions in brussels which are confidential but we have high hopes that we shall reach an agreeable settlement <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not able to go so far as to give a definite date or period of time but i should have thought that it would be years rather than months and that that would preclude what the noble lord had in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords the government expect to publish the green paper on copyright and related topics in the middle of this month <e> <s> it will be entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl may indeed press me to try to give a more precise date but i am afraid that i could not go further than my original answer <e> <s> the government are indeed aware of the need to update the copyright act and if the noble earl can be patient till the middle of this month he will certainly see the more precise ideas that are in the governments mind at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords the green paper will have many recommendations but i am afraid that i must ask the noble lord to be as patient as the rest of us <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i could go quite as far as that <e> <s> i am afraid that once again must ask the noble lord to be a little patient till the middle of this month <e> <s> perhaps we can then go into it in further detail <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are very grateful for the welcome that has been accorded to this order by the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede <e> <s> i too was very interested in the subject of baby-beef when i read the order and thought that i should have to give some description of it <e> <s> therefore i was pleased that the noble lord did not press me to give a more technical description of male bovine animals of a certain age <e> <s> i understand though i am not too sure that it is a question of how many teeth the beast possesses before it passes into adolescence <e> <s> baby-beef is hardly known in the united kingdom <e> <s> as i mentioned during my remarks baby-beef does however have significant importance for at least two member states and from my own knowledge a third <e> <s> therefore the question of exports of baby-beef from yugoslavia to greece is of great importance to the community and to yugoslavia <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until ten minutes to eight <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do adjourn during pleasure until eight oclock as i understand was agreed by the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords the government were glad to be associated with the consultative document <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are well aware of the needs for technological training especially in the industries my noble friend mentioned <e> <s> indeed the open technical training is intended to work through existing education and training institutions <e> <s> we believe that the open university and indeed the bbc will both be very useful vehicles for this concept of the open tech <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed everything the noble lord has said is very much in the mind of my right honourable friend in the department of employment and the government intend to use every educational opportunity and facility to further the concept of the open tech be it the open university be it the bbc be it television be it colleges of advanced technology every avenue will be used for this new concept <e>", "<cs> my lords i would have to take advice on the computer language being taught to children <e> <s> the programme that i have outlined relevant to the question on the order paper deals with postgraduates and young people who have left school and are receiving further education either at work or before they go further into new technological industries <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is a little wide of the original question on the order paper but certainly the noble lords comments will be noted in the department <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall take very careful note of the noble earls comments <e> <s> as one who studied for two years and got an o-level in greek i believe it is particularly relevant that we should study newer languages <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very interested to note the relevant points raised by the noble baroness on the university of aston <e> <s> i think the first part of the noble baronesss question was a little wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords comments are very welcome and indeed he is very accurate we accept them <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my earlier answers did give the noble lord some indication that the open tech goes a little further than the open university as such but of course the open university will be a very valuable vehicle for the overall concept of open tech as suggested by the manpower services commission <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will have due warning of further questions to be put down by my noble friend <e> <s> indeed we are grateful for his interest <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords question is rather like the curates egg it is good in parts and not so good in other parts <e> <s> indeed the whole concept of open tech accepts that we need further and continuing efforts to improve the technological skills in training particularly as regards young people in our country <e> <s> but so far as the first part of the noble lords question is concerned

the house do adjourn during pleasure until <e>", "<cs> the noble lord was not meant to hear it <e>", "<cs> really <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ross of marnock said that he wanted an explanation <e> <s> i hesitated to intervene in the volley of comments that were flying across the committee but in clause a and and similarly in clause b and it is crystal clear to me that subsection seems to explain in part what goes on in subsection of both the clauses <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross and i think this is very relevant to his amendment no <e> <s> asked what changes would be prescribed <e>

people <e> <s> there are copies of the consultation paper which will detail the regulations <e> <s> these are available in the library <e>", "<cs> my remarks were possibly a little long for the noble lord lord hughes but i did point out that b and d hung together that b was specifically at the behest of the roman catholic hierarchy in scotland and that d spelt out everything in far more detail <e>

and denominational schools <e> <s> possibly i should declare an interest in that i went to a denominational school i suppose from the age of eight until but i must be one of the few people certainly on these benches speaking on this matter who according to the noble lord lord taylor must take care <e> <s> he said the figure was one in six in dundee i do not know what it is in scotland as a whole <e>", "<cs> the scottish office does in fact read very carefully the comments that are made from all parts of your lordships house and i have no doubt that they will read the comments of my noble friend as well as the comments of the noble lord lord ross and others through the ages <e>", "<cs> my lords the committee will have listened with care to the explanation of the amendment by the noble lord lord mccarthy and i am sure we were grateful for his references to the explanatory notes <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord will accept that it will not be often that the secretary of state his ministers or representatives of the department would expect in any way to direct the commission over any particular organisations or groups of organisations whom it should consult <e> <s> we continue to believe that the commission should normally be left to undertake its own consultations as it sees fit <e>", "<cs> i have listened and i am sure that the committee has listened with care to my noble friends <e>", "<cs> i am grateful and i am sure that the committee too will be grateful to my noble friend for explaining both amendments at once <e> <s> as my noble friend has stated both amendments certainly amendment no <e> <s> concerns the situation where an industrial training board has come to an end and is abolished <e> <s> i am sure that we would accept that logically that must mean the cessation of the operation of the board <e> <s> it will mean that any obligations that only the board could have imposed will be extinguished <e> <s> but in the event of winding up or abolishing the industrial training board it is very important to ensure that first the affairs are discontinued and wound up in orderly manner and secondly that there is a reasonable degree of equity between the contributors and the levy payers <e>", "<cs> my memory is fairly fresh from what my noble friend had to say at the committee stage of another bill last night <e> <s> i will save the time of the committee and say i will gladly write to my noble friend and spell out in detail what i have in mind <e>", "<cs> as i and i am sure the committee have grown to learn the noble lord lord mccarthy <e>", "<cs> my lords all the facilities of the manpower services commission will be available to help those workers who lose their jobs as a result of the defence review and who need help in finding new jobs or training for fresh employment <e> <s> it is the governments policy to create the conditions in which firms can be helped to become more competitive and so create the new jobs needed <e>", "<cs> my lords if i could take the second supplementary question first the government are well aware of the concern of parties including the local authority to see that any land held by the royal navy

considered by the government and others <e> <s> so far as the first supplementary question asked by the noble lord lord jacques is concerned as he and the house will be aware and we shall be hearing

supplementary question on land if the land is not covered by the royal navy or indeed is not part of the ministry <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the house will agree and the noble lord lord shinwell will agree that the so-called run-down which is not closing portsmouth altogether there will still be approximately workers in the dockyard after the entire review has taken place will take at least three years <e> <s> this we understand and we hope will give reasonable time to see what further opportunities can be made available for the workers who lose their jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not entirely sure which bodies the noble lord believes take the decision <e> <s> ministry of defence land which is surplus to requirements is something i have already covered in two answers <e> <s> i confirm that if there is any surplus land the government will make sure that the local authorities are able to take what action they wish <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to admit that i have not seen the precise information to which my noble friend refers but i will acquaint myself with it <e>", "<cs> my lords the one thing i have always learnt and i think the whole house will have learned when dealing with lawyers and particularly the noble and learned lord is never to deal with hypotheses <e> <s> if there is land which is surplus to requirements for the ministry of defence then indeed it is entirely up to local authorities or any other interested parties who may wish to acquire that land to take the normal and traditional steps <e> <s> if the noble lord has any further questions perhaps i could write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords the particular point raised by the noble lord was the run-down in the change in defence strategy that is three years <e> <s> the government would not nor i think would anyone else suggest that three years is entirely sufficient <e> <s> indeed there is no period that would be sufficient <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house do now adjourn during pleasure until pm as i understand was agreed through the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we should be grateful for the interest and indeed for the comments which have been expressed by the noble lords lord ponsonby lord jenkins and lord annan <e> <s> the latters weighty presence brings a tremendous depth and breadth of experience to one side of the entertainments

noble lord would allow me to inquire i shall certainly let him know as soon as may be during the recess <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the noble lord lord jenkins with his enormous experience is in

lord ross have a note of how the groupings were going to be made <e> <s> however if i could now deal with amendments nos <e> <s> and i think the house will agree that what i have to say about those is quite enough for the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble lords lord ross and lord davies would accept that the purpose of my somewhat lengthy remarks was to clarify a doubt which had been presented to the government in this rather narrow field <e> <s> i hope the noble lord lord ross will accept that <e> <s> he may object to the length of my remarks but surely he should know that we do have to take care where doubt has arisen <e> <s> i promise him as i promise the rest of the house that i will curtail my remarks in respect of later amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords from the opening remarks of the noble lord lord ross i thought that the house was due for a fairly long explanation <e> <s> however the noble lord has spelled out the reasons for his amendment and it seems that the question of whether to use either the word may or the word shall is one that both in this particular bill and in others gives rise to much anxious and vexatious debate <e>", "<cs> my lords no statistics are available on the number of overseas persons who were temporarily employed this summer in united kingdom hotels and restaurants but i am sure that the house will be glad to know that the hotel and catering industry training board manpower information survey indicates that only per cent <e> <s> of those employed in the industry are non-british <e> <s> furthermore per cent <e> <s> of trainees and per cent <e> <s> of young persons aged between and employed in the industry are british <e>", "<cs> my lords while expressing some jealousy for my noble friend as to whom he picked up on the motorway i think i heard him say it was a young male scandinavian but possibly i did not hear that first time i am happy to inform him that there are no statutory powers which would compel employers especially in this sector to disclose any information on the ethnic origin of their employees <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness will be interested to know that at present over persons

responsible for giving careers advice and vocational guidance to young people <e> <s> they are aware of the opportunities available in this sector and i am sure they will be aware of the problem if they read what the noble baroness has had to say <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend would like to put down a specific question possibly we could look into the matter on that basis <e>", "<cs> my lords i did mention before and i reiterate that there are no powers at the moment which would compel employers in this sector to disclose the kind of information which would help the noble lord and possibly the house <e> <s> i am afraid i am a little in the dark as to the particular events to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> i hope he is not thinking of the royal wedding <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for the comment of my noble friend <e> <s> of course nationals of member states of the european community are free to travel wherever they wish within the community so there is complete freedom of movement there <e> <s> as far as foreign nationals who do not have this right to come and work in the united kingdom are concerned there are fairly strict rules which are very carefully adhered to <e> <s> these protect employment within this particular sector but we do bear in mind what my noble friend has said <e>", "<cs> my lords on nd july my noble friend lord trefgarne told the noble baroness that a statement would be made as soon as possible <e> <s> for the time being i have nothing to add to that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that is a little wide of the

describes as popular solvents is best left to the individual trader or far better education by police parents teachers and others taking a much more personal line with the possible young sniffers

that the noble lord lord peart will bear in mind the figures that i stressed to him of the apprentice opportunities available in west cumbria in other industries <e>", "<cs> not necessarily my lords

himself <e> <s> i believe that we were all most interested and fascinated to hear the brief relevant and powerfully argued speeches <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall take the last question first <e> <s> we shall not hinder the proposed legislation before your lordships this afternoon <e> <s> as i stated in my conclusions we have reservations as to whether the bill will achieve what we believe its supporters hope it will achieve <e> <s> with regard to government legislation on the whole question of copyright and piracy of videos we shall introduce it once we have completed the usual process of consultation following the green paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i try to answer the two questions from my noble friends lord harmar-nicholls and lord drumalbyn <e> <s> i stressed that the government had shall i say <e> <s> neutral feelings on this bill <e> <s> i stressed that we did not feel that it achieved entirely what we believe its supporters hoped it would achieve <e> <s> i stressed to the noble lord lord jenkins of putney that the aims and objects of the bill before the house this afternoon were part of a wider field of copyright reform <e> <s> i said that we should bring forward legislation in due course after having taken consultations on the green paper <e> <s> so far as the question of my noble friend lord drumalbyn is concerned it is entirely for the noble lord lord fletcher if he wishes for any assistance to speak to the government when doubtless we should afford to the noble lord all the courtesy that i hope we usually show <e>", "<cs> my lords the post offices

improved productivity <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly i shall convey the comments of the noble lord to the post office <e> <s> no doubt they will be fascinated to read of the exchanges across the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is a little wide of the original question but i shall endeavour to find out and to write to my noble friend as far as i can obtain detailed advice <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the post office will be pleased that the almighty also watches over norwich <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord was kind enough to warn me he might wish to say a few words on this brief and i hoped fairly simple bill which is before us today <e> <s> certainly i had noticed that there were paragraphs in the schedule <e> <s> the noble lord has asked a number of very detailed questions <e> <s> i shall attempt to answer some of them <e> <s> i hope that he and your lordships house will bear with me when i say that i do not think that i can give him the detailed answers to everything that he asked today <e> <s> i shall attempt to answer as much as i can <e> <s> may i inquire as to the precise details and indeed the legal explanation of what he pointed out to your lordships in paragraph of the schedule as to what were works deemed to be within the western isles islands area <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indebted to the noble lord <e> <s> i have no information as to wave energy or indeed the time-scale of such a modern development in other forms of energy generation <e> <s> i will endeavour to obtain some precise information and pass it on to the noble lord lord ross as swiftly as possible <e> <s> i hope i have answered most of the queries of the noble lord lord ross <e> <s> i can assure him that we are very grateful for his interest in this part of lewis <e> <s> we shall examine his comments very closely and i will write to him as i promised earlier with answers that have not given today <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord mansfield i beg to move the motion standing in his name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has been kind enough to speak to a number of amendments in his name on the schedule before us this afternoon <e> <s> as he has pointed out all these amendments seek to extend to regions in their role as weights and measures authorities the right to be consulted on applications for licences <e> <s> there are later amendments on the marshalled list which similarly seek to extend other powers of inspection and entry to the weights and measures authority <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i could correct a doubt that could be in my noble friends mind <e> <s> i said and the noble lord lord ross seemed to agree with me that i would be loath to think that an application could be refused by the licensing authority because of doubts about a trader expressed by the weights and measures authority which were not supported by evidence of relevant convictions <e> <s> i think that that goes a long way towards meeting the point that has been expressed by my noble friend but in addition to the comments that i have already made i would also stress that there is no need to give the express right to bodies such as consumer authorities or weights and measures authorities to object any interested body has the right to object to the licensing authority when licences have been applied for <e>", "<cs> i will <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has pointed out that these amendments follow on from the group of amendments that he spoke to earlier <e> <s> my noble friend has suggested that <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend and the house will see that in some respects if that would please my noble friend this group of amendments is similar to those moved and i would say at the outset that the government would resist any extension of the three categories of authorised person already identified by my noble friend in the clause namely a local authority official the police or the fire authority <e> <s> we believe these three categories are sufficient for the purposes of this clause which concerns the right of entry and inspection <e> <s> if we increased the category we believe there would be no end to the various official bodies which could legitimately or otherwise claim that they should have a power of inspection and entry to premises <e> <s> however the government are very keen that the businessman carrying on his legitimate activity should not be plagued and this is not to strong a word by a steady stream of callers from statutory bodies wishing to inspect premises <e> <s> in our view we have got the balance right and the three categories identified in the clause are those essential to ensuring that the licensing requirements are being adhered to <e> <s> the weights and measures authority which incidentally is not the licensing authority but the regional authority already has powers to enter and inspect weightng apparatus or equipment <e> <s> i cannot see that it requires the wider powers suggested by this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord and the house will be very interested to learn that as regards this particular amendment we are not of the opinion that there is very much between the noble lord and myself on this particular issue <e> <s> this is a fairly short clause and i hope fairly definitive <e> <s> under the clause as drafted i am satisfied that the local authority has some flexibility in balancing its books <e> <s> for example there is no requirement in the clause that proceeds must equal costs in a month or a quarter or indeed a calendar year or any year <e> <s> the local authority thus has some flexibility in ensuring over whatever period it may choose that its fees and expenses are ultimately in balance <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the clause as drawn does not preclude a small profit or a small loss either way <e> <s> but in both paragraphs <e>", "<cs> my lords the provisions of clause which we are considering in these three amendments are designed primarily to cater for the situation of a taxi which is journeying to what we call a named destination such as an airport or a station in another area <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross has suggested the scenario that that taxi having dropped its fare at let us say the airport or the station would not then be entitled under the existing law or the bills present <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ross will be very disappointed <e> <s> there will be no compelling reasons from me but just nagging accuracy i hope <e> <s> of course it is difficult to predict exactly at this time what kind of conditions we might need to prohibit <e> <s> indeed our hope is that such a prohibition would not be necessary because in the joint working party we envisaged and envisage still with local authorities and the trade that a wide measure of agreement can emerge <e> <s> the conditions which are prescribed under clause may reflect a view of the consensus with the implication that local authorities will not feel it necessary or desirable to add substantially to the core of conditions <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know how much things have changed if at all since the noble lord lord ross occupied cars used by the scottish office <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord ross seems to query why we have provided this special defence for a public service vehicle waiting on a taxi stance <e> <s> we find two main arguments <e> <s> first of all we think it would make a nonsense of the general prohibition of unauthorised use of a taxi stance if any vehicle was able to use a taxi stance for the purpose of picking up or setting down passengers <e> <s> to give one example i would say that chaos could ensue in public places such as railway stations or airports if the driver of any vehicle was able to wait in a taxi stance to pick up or set down passengers <e> <s> it would soon become quite clear to the drivers of all private vehicles that this was much the most convenient way of avoiding parking issues not least because by their function taxi stances tend to be most conveniently located to any points of access <e> <s> on the other hand there are far fewer public service vehicles <e> <s> of course many of them operate from bus stops and their likely use or abuse of this provision is very limited in the extreme but we consider that it makes some sense to have emergency provisions for them <e>", "<cs> my lords we have consulted the draftsmen on this amendment and we are happy to say that we are glad to accept it <e> <s> as the noble lord lord ross has pointed out the amendment makes clear that not even vehicles which are exempted from the general taxi provisions in clause are exempt from the offence provisions which we discussed earlier in clause and <e> <s> therefore we are happy to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall deal with that when i have dealt with the first amendment marked no <e> <s> my lords <e> <s> these amendments are designed to give a more precise definition of what we call private markets than the present clause provides for <e> <s> we now propose that for the purposes of the clause a licence is required for a private market which is to be defined as a market <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house may i say that i hope that i can assure the noble lord lord howie that the amendment that i moved purely gives the local authority discretion if they see special circumstances not to change the full expenses because there may be varying circumstances that i am sure the house and the noble lord lord howie could imagine where possibly they might see that it was not reasonable to charge the full cost of rendering some repairs to the owner or the occupier <e> <s> there could be special circumstances why the full cost should not be charged and this little amendment simply seeks to give the local authority in such circumstances the discretion to charge a reasonable share of the cost <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ross of marnock made a very powerful argument about going to the sheriff and covered various other points <e> <s> but when he expressed his views as to the matter of timing between and days then i think the minds of your lordships were drawn to the reasons which lie behind his amendment <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord will be aware and indeed the house too that action in emergency for any access to pipes or drains under subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave perhaps i might try first of all to reply as a non-lawyer to the noble lord lord ross and then to answer some of the very valid points as i think them to be raised by my noble friend lord campbell <e> <s> the main thrust of the question by the noble lord lord ross was why is the sheriff brought into this particular clause <e> <s> i cannot say that i think all property owners would agree with the noble lord lord ross in his description of sheriffs as being some sort of ogres and terrifying bogeymen who strike terror into the hearts of largely innocent citizens <e> <s> i think he is stretching his point a little in that kind of description <e>", "<cs> my lords as data on export orders are collected from only part of british industry no overall figure of their value is currently available <e>", "<cs> my lords the latest figures available for show that the trade surplus for the year for the united kingdom was in the region of billion dollars which we believe compares very favourably with the comparative surplus figure for the united states of billion dollars while japan and west germany had deficits of approximately and billion dollars respectively and we think that is a great success story <e>", "<cs> my lords i will write to the noble lord with the current figure as of todays date <e> <s> i would point out that they are approximate figures of very large sums of money <e> <s> nevertheless i will do my best to see if i can obtain a sterling equivalent for the noble lord <e>", "<cs> yes my lords so far as the united kingdom figures are concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords to elucidate on the first part of the main question data on particular export orders in value terms are available in the united kingdom only on merchant shipping but there are indicators of new export orders placed with engineering and they are published monthly <e> <s> those two are the only reasonably precise figures we can give at the moment <e>", "<cs> that is rather wide of the original question my lords but i shall endeavour to find out and write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures i have are for <e> <s> i am afraid that i could not without notice compare them with those for <e>", "<cs> my lords having given the figures for i will inquire into the relevant figures for and write to my noble friend <e> <s> the figures are not yet available <e>", "<cs> my lords inquiries have been made about the position <e> <s> i understand that elstree aerodrome is privately owned by the montclare shipping company limited who operate it under ordinary licence issued by the civil aviation authority <e> <s> this enables the licensee to give or withhold permission for his aerodrome to be used as he thinks fit <e> <s> the terms under which permission is given are a matter between him and the users <e> <s> i regret that in the circumstances i cannot comment on the fees charged to mr chutani or any agreements between the aerodrome and the london school of flying <e>", "<cs> my lords the licence under which elstree aerodrome is operated is laid down in the air navigation order <e> <s> the grant of the licence is regulated under article of that order and of course the civil aviation authority may attach conditions to the grant of the licence <e> <s> any of those conditions would concern the safety of aircraft operations <e> <s> if there are any complaints or specific problems as to a licence between an individual and the private owner of the aerodrome that would leave any aggrieved individual in the position of taking the normal action which would be available to any other aggrieved individual <e>", "<cs> my lords when an aerodrome is licensed for public use as opposed to ordinary use then of course the aerodrome must be available to all persons on equal terms and equal conditions <e> <s> but the airfield at elstree is licensed under the air navigation order for merely ordinary use and is available for the use of the licensee and persons who are specifically authorised by the licensee <e> <s> under the current licensing regulations there is no requirement that all users should be accepted on the same terms so far as landing fees or any conditions are concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly take note of the position but i think that i should not comment any further <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord is under a slight misapprehension <e> <s> it is not the licence fees that are at issue but rather the landing fees that are being charged by the licensee to a private individual <e> <s> so far as the main part of the noble lords supplementary question is concerned the answer is no <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the other licensed airfields are concerned i do not think so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the house will be grateful as i am myself to the noble lords lord ponsonby of shulbrede and lord taylor of gryfe for what they have said about these two orders today <e> <s> the noble lord lord ponsonby raised the very valid question raised also by the noble lord lord taylor of index-linking of the limits and the rise in value of the limits i have introduced today over and above those of <e> <s> i am afraid i have not got a precise and detailed answer compounded over the full period but i will ascertain the precise statistics requested by both noble lords in as succinct a form as possible and i will write to them <e> <s> i hope that will satisfy your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords so far over organisations and individuals have commented in writing on the consultative document and comments from others are still awaited <e> <s> we shall need to digest these views before deciding how to proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the government will make haste but i wonder whether the noble baroness has got her usual glasses on since as far as i am aware there is no green paper <e> <s> there may be a consultative document and your lordships may agree that it is a different shade of green but there are still views coming in and as the noble baroness and the house will be aware it is a very complicated subject <e> <s> there are indeed two options in the consultative document but the government do not wish to take an over-hasty view as a result of all these views that are coming in <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope i can reassure my noble friend so far as debate is concerned <e> <s> the house will see that the noble baroness has her name to a no day named motion on the order paper <e> <s> with regard to this subject having been under discussion in your lordships house or elsewhere for a long time i would remind my noble friend that the consultative document was published on th december last year and the closing date for the reception of views of individuals and organisations was th march with a very brief extra time limit which we are still in now <e> <s> we shall need to digest albeit hastily these many views that have come in from the organisations before we can take any definite view or take any further action <e>", "<cs> my lords my instructions are that we shall of course be considering publication of either a white or green paper or indeed any other coloured paper <e> <s> the noble baroness will see that there is a mixture of the two already <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the question asked by the noble lord about the affirmative resolution is not affected by or in any way contravened by the amendment that we are seeking to make <e> <s> so far as the negative resolution procedure is concerned the only reason for the amendment is to tidy up what the draftsman thought was a small defect in the normal negative resolution procedure in either house <e> <s> as i hope i set out to explain the government thought is that clause as it stands could be taken to show that any successful prayer would annul the order as of the time of making the order whereas i understand the amendment would leave the actual withdrawal of the order to the secretary of state <e> <s> i have been handed a note to say that the noble lord <e> <s> lord bishopston is quite correct <e> <s> i hope that he will be able to accept that and if i have misled him or the house then i would apologise <e>", "<cs> my lords the choice of names for the vip suites at heathrow airport is a matter for the board of the british airports authority and not for the government <e> <s> i understand that the proposed changes were prompted by the reduction in the number of suites in the central area from four to two and the consequential difficulty of choosing which of the four names of equally famous aviation pioneers to drop <e>", "<cs> my lords we would certainly agree it is very sad that these famous names will no longer be noted and attached to the suites in the central area at heathrow <e> <s> i will certainly convey your lordships opinion to the british airports authority <e> <s> my noble friend is quite correct i understand that there is an additional vip facility as he described and i shall check whether a name might be applied to that facility <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that despite the present dispute at heathrow <e> <s> inconvenience to air travellers has been kept to a minimum <e> <s> it would not be appropriate for the government to intervene in this dispute but i do hope that in everyones interest a settlement will be reached very soon <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to my noble friends first question i understand that it is indeed the case that other members of the british airways staff have assisted in various duties which are normally carried out by the ramp workers <e> <s> as to my noble friends second question there have been reports on the point he has indicated but i am afraid we should require verification from british airways management themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords in so far as british airways are not always aware of the comments of the noble baroness i shall certainly draw to their attention the noble baronesss remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i can endeavour to bring the remarks of both my noble friends to the attention of british airways but as there is to be a meeting of the union side tomorrow i do not think that i should go any further on that this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know from where my noble friend obtains his information but it is a trifle dangerous to suggest that something is indeed a fact when it may not be <e> <s> but i shall give the assurance which i gave to both of my noble friends that i will bring his remarks together with theirs to the attention of british airways <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments green paper on copyright designs and performers protection which as your lordships i am sure are all aware was published last july invited a lively vigorous and to my mind fascinating public debate on all aspects of copyright <e> <s> for that reason alone i with i am sure the whole house am very grateful to the noble lord lord lloyd of hampstead for affording your lordships the very welcome opportunity of discussing some and i would say only some of the very important issues which are currently under review in both copyright and related areas <e> <s> we are all grateful too to the other noble lords who have contributed to this most interesting and valuable debate <e> <s> the government will pay very close heed to all the views that have been expressed and we shall take those views fully into account in the deliberations that assuredly will follow the completion of the present consultative phase <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will be patient i shall come to that in a paragraph or two when i hope to cover his particular point <e> <s> to charge a levy which would be sufficient even to raise the green paper figure of million per year and i would stress that that figure does not represent a government estimate of actual losses but is merely a reworking and modification of earlier figures provided by the record industry would require a very large percentage increase in the price of tapes and the government would be reluctant to impose this upon the public especially since imposition of a levy would involve what we would regard as rough justice with many tape users who never record copyright music having to pay these could include for example organisations for the blind and would also probably cover and catch the educational use which has been referred to widely in your lordships house tonight <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords i shall take careful note of this particular suggestion raised by the noble lord lord jenkins <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble earl for correcting me if i have misinterpreted anything so far <e> <s> i take note of his preliminary sortie on the deadline for comments coming into the department <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not dare to intervene in this debate nor indeed in this particular aspect since i understand that we have if i may say so legal privilege in this house but no doubt the comments of the noble lord will be noted <e> <s> i think that it might be the wish of the house that the noble lord lord napier might take the greatest care as to what has been indicated by the noble lord lord mishcon although i think that your lordships will agree that there is nothing laid down with great clarity in the standing orders on this particular matter <e> <s> but i am sure that we are grateful for the will of the house that might have been suggested by the noble lord lord mishcon <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government are well aware of the european parliaments resolution but maintain their view that unilateral action to ban imports of seal products would not be justified <e> <s> the commission alone can put forward proposals for new community legislation <e> <s> if in response to the european parliaments resolution the commission tables proposals for a community-wide ban on imports of seal products i can assure your lordships that the government will consider them very carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords regarding the last part of my noble friends supplementary question i would refer him to the third sentence of my original answer <e> <s> my noble friend will be aware that a study by the nature conservancy council is being undertaken for the <e>", "<cs> my lords the position of the government is that there is no threat to the conservation of seals around our coasts indeed we believe that the problem of conservation is

lord lord molloy for introducing so eloquently and with such passion his motion this evening <e> <s> certainly i found it to be especially timely and especially interesting because it behoves all of

employment needs <e> <s> i would like to give to your lordships one or two indications of the range of measures which the government are taking and how these measures are being constantly brought back to the important criterion of relevance to present and future employment conditions which are so fundamentally shaped by technological development <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble baroness for her clarification <e> <s> there are the educational aspects and above all the educational aspects of the itecs <e> <s> i wonder whether i could study the noble baronesss speech and write to her in close detail <e>", "<cs> my lords the government would not wish to oppose the amendments standing in the name of the noble lord lord fletcher <e> <s> the amended bill is however seen solely as an effort to deal with the growing problem of copyright piracy <e> <s> the government are not in general willing to short-circuit the consultative process following the publication of the green paper on

freely available from the inland revenue one for the employees and one for the employers <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of all profit sharing provisions be they profit sharing schemes or share option schemes is to encourage all employees to identify their own interests with those of the company employing them <e> <s> this is the major objective of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords we are prepared to make further studies in the direction of the loi monory scheme but we think that this concept breaks the essential link in which we believe between the employee and his own company <e> <s>

nevertheless i believe that the figures which i quoted in my original answer to my noble friends question are indicative of the great success of the schemes that we have in operation at the moment

is by-the-by <e> <s> it is possibly an associate benefit <e> <s> but the main thrust should be that the employee may associate himself and his savings with his own company <e>", "<cs> my lords the

standards throughout the world <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have no firm information on the effects of the extension of permitted hours in scotland nor have they received any representations that the increased hours have had any adverse effects <e>", "<cs> my lords the government would not be able to indicate the consumption of alcohol in scotland but i am able to say that there has been

to the consumption of alcohol in england and wales <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole house will be glad to have that endorsement from a fellow scot <e>", "<cs> i understand that the answer to that is no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i would apologise for the inadvertent absence of my noble friend who was to have taken this matter but as your lordships might appreciate communications with scotland are a trifle fraught this evening and my noble friend the minister has had to leave me as a great deer lover to try to explain i hope adequately the governments position on this point <e> <s> my noble friend lord campbell of croy suggested that it might be appropriate that the government state their view <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of your lordships perhaps i might try briefly to reply to the two points which were raised first of all by the noble lord lord northfield <e> <s> he thought first that it might be more suitable to define land by use of the word agricultural and he suggested this <e> <s> i am advised that we would have difficulties in using agricultural for this particular purpose and of course this would be in terms of the use to which the land is put <e> <s> we think there would be considerable difficulty in inserting the example which the noble lord gave agricultural in the places he suggested it might go in since we wonder <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that this is a matter which is more complicated than i can go into in seconds this evening <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will agree that i accept his invitation to write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords

to previous convictions which is no longer required now that we are doing away with the separate sets of penalites for first and subsequent convictions <e>", "<cs> my lords it might be convenient if i tried to put at rest the minds of the noble lord lord northfield and other noble lords who are confused by the plethora of amendments to differing orders and acts that are concerned with this knotty

correct one point in my peroration on this amendment i said within six months but i am told that it will be about six months <e> <s> i hear encouraging noises from my noble friend lord colville who knows about these matters and has great expertise both as a lawyer and as a minister in his past incarnation <e> <s> i am also reliably informed that the revised document will contain the deer scotland act as amended by the bill that we have been discussing this evening <e> <s> so i think that that is an added bonus to the noble lord lord northfield and to your lordships house <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords <e> <s> i thought that the noble lord had spoken once on this amendment <e> <s> i am sorry if i led my noble friend into the paths of misadventure but i understood that the noble

amount of confusion as to which amendment we were dealing with <e> <s> the noble lord shakes his head <e> <s> nevertheless i hope that he will accept my apology <e>", "<cs> my lords it would not be appropriate for her majestys government to give advice or instructions on such matters to trading standards officers who as the noble lord is aware are employed by local authorities <e> <s> it is for the courts to decide what is the legal definition of a pint of draught beer and for local weights and measures authorities to enforce that law <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord first asked me about short measure <e> <s> i would draw to his attention the fact that duty on beer is paid at the brewery on the volume of the beer brewed and if the publican barkeeper or employee were to give short measure the publican pays more vat on the same volume of beer simply because the amount of vat is determined by his income from sales <e> <s> i hope therefore even at this time that the noble lord will see that the revenue is not defrauded in that respect <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord and i are on the same line in that i do not believe the landlord is able to pocket the difference because he will pay more vat as i pointed out <e> <s> secondly i am sure noble lords are aware of this a pint of beer varies from one part of the country to another according to custom <e> <s> i understand that in the region where there is at present a law case outstanding the custom is that a pint of beer should have a certain collar or head on it whereas in other parts of the country that is not necessarily the custom <e> <s> i am sure noble lords do not need me to tell them that a pint of beer contains the liquid together with the head or collar or whatever else goes with the beer

that the house be resumed <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> the purpose of the bill which is before your lordships this afternoon is to empower my

winstanley for very clearly and succinctly explaining the purpose of these two amendments nos <e> <s> and which are in his name <e> <s> we are fully in sympathy with the spirit of these amendments but i would say immediately that we believe they would ask too much of those who are appointed to give certificates for the purposes of the new provisions in clause <e>", "<cs> when i attempted to reply to the noble lord lord winstanley it appeared to me that it was not so much a question of whether the patient was capable of understanding or being understood it had far more to do with the doctor psychologist psychiatrist or whoever was speaking to the patient because it was this person who had to sign the certificate <e> <s> the effect i was striving to put to the noble lord lord winstanley was that if one had to sign a certificate it was different from merely expressing an opinion or wondering whether the patient was capable of understanding or did understand <e> <s> there has to be a great deal of certainty if an expert is to sign a certificate <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord lord airedale would consider that merely expressing an opinion would be a strong enough basis upon which to sign a certificate <e> <s> signing a certificate is the basis of what we have included in a b and c of clause <e> <s> however i shall certainly take on board the point which has been raised by the noble lord lord airedale <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord lord winstanley has another point to put to me <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have made it clear that they fully support the efforts of the airlines both in iata and in the board of airline representatives in the united kingdom to reach agreement to move back to charging approved fares <e> <s> both iata and baruk have the governments support for their current efforts but the success of market clean-up programmes depends on the airlines rather than on government <e> <s> we have repeatedly stressed that we must look to the industry to put its own house in order and we are glad that it is now trying to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise if the noble baroness believes that i have either misunderstood or have failed to answer the question <e> <s> i would stress that that is a matter of opinion in your lordships house <e> <s> but as regards the noble baronesss second question i am sure she will be aware that the purpose of inserting tariff clauses into permits is to clarify the legal obligations of the airlines themselves to charge the officially approved fares <e> <s> as i am sure the noble baroness has heard from me and indeed from many others at this box the government are firmly of the opinion that this is a matter for the airline industry itself <e> <s> we support all the efforts that have been made <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer that i gave may not be worth a great deal so far as the noble baroness is concerned but i would stress to her and to your lordships that it happens to be the truth and is definitely laid down <e> <s> so far as the keeping of the permits is concerned this depends upon bringing a case to the courts and as i and others have repeatedly told the noble baroness there is a problem in bringing these cases to the courts and above all in the courts dealing with such cases between i would stress this to the noble baroness a willing buyer and a willing seller <e>", "<cs> my lords the first steps which the government would take would be legal steps and those are the ones that i mentioned in the courts <e> <s> before the government withdrew a permit that would be a matter for discussion between the government authorities and the airlines and there might be more than one of them <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the government will seek to obtain agreement with other governments <e> <s> we are very grateful to the noble lord for pointing out that enforcement in this country could be harmful to british airlines <e>", "<cs> my lords as i am sure the noble lord will be aware there are international agreements between the airlines themselves as part of that great industry and it is not for the government to intervene in agreements entered into between the airlines <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the committee will appreciate the swift and clear way in which the noble lord has moved his amendment <e> <s> we appreciate the motive behind the amendment but i have to say that the government cannot agree to recommend its acceptance <e> <s> we believe from the outset that it is accepted that the ownership qualification for a british ship must be identical whether it is registered under the small ships register or under part i of the act in order that the expression british ship is capable of only one interpretation <e> <s> the noble lords amendment which proposes that a certificate or document under the small ships register shall not be treated as evidence or representation of title to the ship undermines this positon <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house will agree that we have had an outstanding debate this evening

channels were in conversation earlier with the noble and learned lord who introduced the report <e>", "<cs> my lords the energy measures introduced following the march budget all applied in scotland <e> <s> these included a price freeze for industrial gas contracts and foundry coke prices and the widening of the boiler conversion scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i was given to understand that price discounts in scotland vary according to the characteristics of the consumers electricity usage <e> <s> i understand that the average price discount is about per cent <e> <s> this is considered as commercially possible and indeed is the average discount <e> <s> my noble friend and the house will know that the final figure is normally arrived at especially for the very large users in the course of negotiations between either the north of scotland hydro board or the south of scotland electricity board and the individual user concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say up to i said average <e> <s> i do not know what the average figure is elsewhere as envisaged by my noble friend perhaps in england and wales <e> <s> i have forgotten what my noble friends second salvo was <e> <s> could he please remind me <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for filling the spare capacity in my brain at least in my memory i do not know in what other departments <e> <s> i stress again that if any major industrial users feel that they are hard done by or that my noble friends figures give them room for asking for further or better terms that is entirely a matter for the south of scotland electricity board and the individual user <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the noble lord any indication of what the policies would be outside scotland <e> <s> i think that probably broadly the same parameters apply for deciding or negotiating a price between large industrial users those users taking in excess of six megawatts as their peak load and the various generating boards <e> <s> as the noble lord will be aware in scotland we have two boards <e> <s> there will be many differing factors i should have thought in excess of in any particular negotiating case <e>", "<cs> my lords i

lordships would agree that a firm of management consultants in this particular field would be able to give clear and succinct advice of the type which was given by the noble baroness to my honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful for the authoritative voice of the noble lord lord mcgregor <e> <s> i wonder whether he made the same error as i did on the last statement <e> <s> did he

agreement on tariffs and trade is the best instrument for achieving the aims which we all seek <e> <s> of course we recognise that unctad has an important role to play since both unctad and the gatt are complementary <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall and can only reiterate the first answer that i gave to the noble lord <e> <s> we attach the greatest importance to a multilateral trade system since we

raised have nothing to do with the question on the order paper and nor do they necessarily have anything to do with the coastguard service <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall read the noble lords comments

the opportunity to discuss albeit somewhat briefly a matter of national and considerable interest <e> <s> in doing so as the noble lord has mentioned he has followed the liberal tradition for it was his late right honourable colleague mr clement davies the then member for montgomery who initiated the first debate on reuters which was held in and from which the noble lord quoted <e>", "<cs> my lords the source of an illegal television broadcast can be traced by the use of radio direction-finding equipment <e> <s> this can only be done however while the station remains on the air <e>", "<cs>

their opinion on how vital and necessary are these services <e> <s> i am not in a minority of one i totally agree and i shall seek to prove to your lordships that in this instance we believe that its importance is recognised in the bill as it stands <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to answer the noble lord lord taylor <e> <s> in the course of my remarks which were long enough although i tried to keep them down i stressed that we regard the directory inquiry service as being of particular importance <e> <s> i do not think there was anything in my remarks which in any way discouraged the use of

lord lord taylor and indeed all consumers are seeking and that it will assist in greater utilisation of the telephone service <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i am afraid i have no instructions at all as to how blind or how dyslexic one has to be or any definition of disablement in these two particular areas further than is set out in the definition clause which i invited your lordships to look at <e> <s>

might be the case for bringing particular functions in other parts of the bill within the scope of clause i hope to show by quoting examples that it would be inappropriate to seek to achieve that

committee that the duties of the secretary of state and the director general set out in clause are specifically related to the provision of telecommunication services in part ii and related functions

<s> i am told that part iv will only be repealed when the cable bill becomes law <e>", "<cs> as we have heard from the passionate speech of the noble lord lord molloy the subject of this amendment is a matter of great concern to all of us including the government namely the interests of the disabled <e> <s> we have mentioned the disabled in our discussions on directory information but this is the first opportunity that we have had to look at the provisions and the safeguards for the disabled <e> <s> i am sure that we shall have not only this opportunity but also a further chance to discuss this very important matter on later amendments which will be of interest to my noble friends lady macleod and lady lane-fox <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble lords mind has been very clearly read

will examine what the noble lord has said but i would not go any further than that <e>", "<cs> the whole committee will have been fascinated and thrilled to hear the main purpose of this amendment so admirably moved by my noble friend lady lane-fox <e> <s> she mentioned quite correctly that i had touched on this problem and this particular amendment when i was speaking on amendment no <e> <s> last week when we covered the problems of new technology and the blind or those whose sight is impaired <e> <s> i recall the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon mentioning his interest <e> <s> he went so

lordships curiosity in the hard-of-hearing and the hearing-impaired about what we want to do and how we hope that new technology may bring differing solutions <e> <s> all the time we continue to bear in mind the problems of the hearing-impaired and the hard-of-hearing and of how we hope that this will be achieved through the conditions of the licence and in the bill <e>", "<cs> we are very grateful to my noble friend lord glanusk for filling us in on some very interesting technical problems and details and he moved his amendment succinctly and with great clarity <e> <s> my noble friend mentioed the term telecommunications apparatus <e> <s> i assure him and your lordships that telecommunications apparatus is covered by the definition in paragraph not only when a system is being run to provide a service to customers but also <e>", "<cs> in reply to my noble friends excellent and succinct summing up of the purpose of his amendments the government see the purpose of the amendments as being to confer on the owner of an interest in land perhaps the meadow to which my noble friend referred upon which telecommunication apparatus is installed under the code a right to compensation which will extend any injurious affection to any interest which he happens to have in any neighbouring land <e> <s> if your lordships were to look at the code they would find injurious affection mentioned <e> <s> i am told that in legal terms it means loss or damage suffered by the owner of an interest in land as a direct consequence of the exercise of powers of compulsory acquisition for the execution and use of duly authorised works <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend withdraws his amendment could i stress to him and the committee that in the scenario he presented if the court says that the apparatus must stay when the owner re-occupies his land then compensation must be paid <e> <s> my noble friend referred to section in fact it is section of the act <e> <s> i did not stress that if an owner reoccupies his land he is entitled to have the land restored to the condition it was in before the installation was made <e> <s> my noble friend will find that in the code on page about halfway down <e> <s> it is in subparagraph of paragraph <e> <s> he will see the words <e>", "<cs> my noble friend was correct to point out the relevance of paragraphs and of the code as well as the relevance of paragraphs and <e> <s> as we are on paragraph now my noble friend was right in bringing us hack to that particular section of the code <e> <s> it may appear to be odd in some ways that the lands tribunal is given a role in assessing compensation under paragraphs and but not under paragraphs and <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i took a risk and quite rightly my noble friend has asked me to elucidate <e> <s> we are replacing the old sub-paragraph <e>", "<cs> the noble lord wants an assurance or some explanation from the government <e> <s> the government recognise that it is vitally important that telecommunications operators should be required to make good the streets which are disturbed by the work that they carry out <e> <s> but i assure the noble lord and the committee that this is already provided for and that the amendment is superfluous <e> <s> all those operators who are authorised by the secretary of state to use the powers in the code and also to undertake works in

lordships will see that <e>", "<cs> i can give a brief answer but not tonight <e> <s> i will study what the noble lord has said and will write to him <e> <s> if he wishes to raise this at a later stage i can answer him but i understand that street and the provisions of paragraph go very wide <e>", "<cs> i can reply swiftly to my noble friend <e> <s> i hope i have read out correctly at this late hour that the statutory undertaker that is the operator is under an obligation to reinstate and to make good the street after the completion of his works <e> <s> i imagine that it is the people we call the street authority who would be the relevant authority under the local council <e> <s> i am pleased that the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey is able to nod assent since he has served and i have not in local government <e> <s> it would be the street authority who would enforce the obligation under section of this splendid puswa the public utilities street works act <e>", "<cs> my noble friend referred to helpful comments which had been made by my noble friend lord glenarthur at an earlier stage in our proceedings on the bill now before us <e> <s> i only hope that my noble friend lord mottistone will be able to bear with me while i attempt to answer the amendment he has moved <e>", "<cs> first of all i am very flattered to be elevated in rank i think that the noble lord lord mcintosh was referring to me as the minister of state or possibly he meant the minister in the other place <e> <s> well i am not there yet but i live in hope <e> <s> i would stress to the noble lord lord mcintosh and indeed to the noble lords lord somers and lord spens the key point of my reply <e> <s> we believe that this problem of numbers and numbering and access to networks is something for the commercial interests and the operators to mutually negotiate an acceptable solution <e> <s> i stress that to the noble lord lord spens <e> <s> if they fail to agree the government intend the director to have powers to intervene and he will be the ultimate authority he will be able to specify what the national numbering arrangements should be <e>", "<cs> if i may briefly reply to the noble lord lord kaldor it is something that has always fascinated me <e> <s> if i may take one example i think what the noble lord is seeking does work not just in england i say this as a scot and it works in scotland too and northern ireland and wales <e> <s> i am not too sure about the republic of ireland but i will leave that for the moment <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned cambridge which i think is his home town if i can call it that <e> <s> as i understand it if the noble lord is ringing a number fairly near to cambridge the code number might be a little different <e> <s> but if the noble lord is ringing my home in scotland from cambridge i can assure him that the number is the same code from cambridge as it would be from london <e> <s> i think these codes tend to vary in the immediate vicinity <e>", "<cs> if i may reply briefly if the noble lord looks in his cambridge book he will find a fascinating number which has the name of one of my noble friends he will find trumpington <e> <s> whether it has an exchange i do not know <e> <s> possibly if we looked in a book at my home or in london we would find a different number from trumpington but this is because trumpington or its local exchange is immediately within the cambridge area where the noble lord lives <e> <s> i would have thought that this anomaly would not apply outwith a radius of from to miles or something like that <e> <s> if i am wrong perhaps we may pursue this further by letter but it is an interesting point and i promise to take it up <e>", "<cs> we certainly fully understand the intention behind the amendment moved by the noble <e>", "<cs> i do not think that there is any difference between what we have in our minds and what the noble lords lord somers and lord spens have in their minds over what we believe to be the purpose of amendments no <e> <s> and <e> <s> both seem to us to wish to ensure that the advisory bodies established under clause will be concerned with consumer matters <e> <s> my noble friend lord cockfield made clear earlier to the committee that he accepts that this clause needs amending to strengthen the role of the national advisory bodies <e> <s> in our earlier debate i think on amendment no <e> <s> my noble friend proposed two changes first that the national advisory bodies should be appointed not by the director but by the secretary of state in order to emphasise their independence and secondly that the terms of reference of the national advisory bodies should be extended to underline the fact that these bodies would be primarily concerned with the interests of consumers <e> <s> these two concessions i believe go a long way to meeting the understandable concern of the noble lords and also of the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe underlined in this amendment as well as in amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> we are grateful to be reminded by my noble friend of the wide definition of the word users <e> <s> we shall study closely what he said and bear his comments in mind <e>", "<cs> as your lordships will be aware we have already spent some time on clause and therefore i hope that i can be reasonably brief in trying to explain what is in our mind so far as the amendment is concerned <e> <s> we are not entirely sure what it is trying to achieve but what we think it does is to place a duty on the advisory bodies whenever they offer advice to the director to give public comment <e> <s> we are not quite sure of the precise meaning of those words but they seem to require the advisory bodies to publish comments on their advice to the director <e> <s> we do not think that this is entirely what noble lords would wish to do because this would surely destroy the nature of the relationship between the director and the advisory bodies <e> <s> also what if the bodies wanted to give advice of a confidential nature to the director <e> <s> if it were to be published it would harm the relationship between the bodies and the director <e>", "<cs> of course we appreciate the purpose of this amendment <e> <s> i stress to the noble lord lord bruce that this is no party matter <e> <s> indeed i had the privilege of making two fairly lengthy statements from this dispatch box on amendments nos <e> <s> and which gave rise i regret to say to a great deal of hilarity as regards the inductive coupler <e> <s> so i have expressed my views on that matter at considerable length <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce may not have been in his place at the time but certainly too many people were <e> <s> anyway he does not need one today because we are speaking very close to one another <e>", "<cs> the explanation of my noble friend lord mottistone is far more technical than i would be able to give <e> <s> i am advised that power refers to the power of the transmission not necessarily to the range or the radius as explained by my noble friend <e> <s> in a house or elsewhere perhaps in the open the range of the hand-held telephone might be greater <e>

chance to put the record straight <e> <s> i would ask him to await comments on the survey which i mentioned in my main answer <e> <s> i cannot promise to bring legislation forward <e> <s> we shall have to see what are the results of the survey <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the main thrust of the noble lords supplementary question goes a little wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> but i can assure the noble lord and all your lordships that it has traditionally been felt justifiable because the actions of one occupier in a house in multiple occupation may put another at risk and the noble lord has pointed out the danger of fire to apply statutory measures designed to ensure that satisfactory means of of escape are provided in the event of fire <e> <s> the noble lord will be aware that all these measures are spelt out in the various housing acts from right through to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i was not aware of that report <e> <s> i shall certainly study it

percentage of fatal accidents caused by such things as non-medicinal products and children taking tablets and similar things which the noble lord mentioned is less than per cent <e> <s> of the total number of fatalities <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are straying a little wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for drawing our attention to the matter and we shall study his remarks carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house will be aware that the noble lord introduced a very similar amendment at an earlier stage when he sought to apply the clause duties to the whole bill <e> <s> after the noble lord moved that amendment the government replied that we felt that it was unclear whether he had considered in detail what would be the consequences of his blanket amendment <e> <s> i believe that the same question arises in the context of amendment no <e> <s> as well as amendment no <e> <s> to which the noble lord was also kindly speaking because it seems that the only concession that has been made to the arguments that we produced on the earlier occasion has been to except part iv of the bill from the proposed scope of the clause duties <e> <s> this afternoon in mentioning part iv the noble lord has reiterated what i said at an earlier stage when we discussed part iv and the cable provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords if i might reply briefly to the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> i think that his concluding remarks made my case <e> <s> the noble lord accepted my remark that we believe that a selective and discriminating approach to the problem is best <e> <s> i hope that i have explained to the noble lord lord bruce and also to the noble lord <e> <s> lord lloyd <e> <s> why we feel that the broad brush approach especially in relation to part v would be wrong in this instance <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a lengthy debate on the subject and we are in danger of going over some of the ground that we covered at an earlier stage <e> <s> i hope that i shall not repeat myself <e> <s> i hope too that we shall not have a repetition of the noise which accompanied the concluding remarks of the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran during the previous stage of the bill when there was some confusion <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may briefly try to answer some of the points that have been raised as a result of my first oration in moving this amendment my noble friend lady macleod asked as did the noble lord lord stoddart how we would be able to define disabled and blind people <e> <s> i am afraid that all i can say tonight is that we are working out how blind people and disabled people can be recognised <e> <s> this is something that will come under the heading of these matters which as i said earlier we shall be considering very carefully indeed <e> <s> as regards what the noble lord lord lloyd and my noble friend lord morris said i understand that the term directory information services is wider in scope and we shall be changing the draft licence to use the term directory information services <e> <s> i hope that that will satisfy the inquiring mind of the noble lord lord lloyd who picks out these points <e>", "<cs> my lords the european air navigation planning group held several informal meetings between september and november to review air traffic service routes and associated navigational aids and proposed a number of improvements in the alignment of routes including all routes criticised by iata <e> <s> at its subsequent formal meeting the group adopted almost all the proposals unanimously and recommended them for endorsement by icao <e> <s> the concurrence of the military authorities in the countries concerned will be needed before the improved routes can be made available to civil air traffic <e> <s> a specialised working group to review area navigation routes and the deployment of radio navigation aids every two and a half years is to be set up <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the noble baronesss last question is concerned only the airlines can answer as to the exact saving of costs in monetary terms <e> <s> i can however confirm that the government agree with iatas calculations of mileage that will be saved and which we hope is indeed being saved <e> <s> as to the three steps mentioned in the earlier comment two of them i understand have been taken and the third is at present under discussion <e> <s> we have high hopes of that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it is exceedingly dangerous certainly for myself although i do not know about the noble baroness to look into a crystal ball to see what we might find <e> <s> if the noble baroness is concerned about these new routes i understand that one of the upper air limit routes is at present operational <e> <s> we hope that there will be a second one over the united kingdom <e> <s> i understand that there are three more which it is hoped will become operational <e> <s> this matter is i think covered by the last part of the reply that i gave to the noble baronesss first question <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his question <e> <s> it impinges possibly on the whole question of air safety <e> <s> i cannot comment upon his question today but i shall note everything that he has had to say most carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords this is all the more reason why we need further and more sophisticated control of the available airspace <e>", "<cs> my lords apart from static engines for power generation and pumping the only engines which rolls-royce limited have sold to iran during the past two years have been two spare dart turboprops for iranian navy fokker f communications aircraft and one spare civil spey engine for a fokker f airliner of iran asseman <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the first part of the noble lords supplementary falls because as i have pointed out the three engines that were supplied are not capable of being of any use to iran in their war with iraq <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can deal first with the noble lords question about rapier <e> <s> i have no knowledge of tiger cat missiles but i can tell the noble lord and your lordships that no spares specific to rapier have been supplied to iran since the revolution <e> <s> as to the noble lords question about what he described as the lethality of the military version or civil version of the spey engine <e> <s> i am able to tell the noble lord that the civil spey which i mentioned is in use in the f is substantially different from the re-heated spey which powers royal air force phantoms and it could not be adapted to power a phantom <e> <s> i stress that the thrust of a mark // spey engine as fitted to the phantoms is pounds <e> <s> the corresponding thrust of the / spey the civil spey which was sent for the f is pounds <e> <s> i could go on because there are different technical specifications <e> <s> i would firmly add that the weight of the civil spey is one-sixth that of the military spey <e> <s> so i am sure that our lordships will see that the military spey is completely different from the spey fitted to the f <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of your lordships house my response is that we shall have to wait to see about this when we come to the cable bill <e> <s> i would not want to declare any responsibility for that this evening <e> <s> but i would not think that there would be any inconsistency with what i have said <e> <s> i hope that satisfies my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to intervene in such a lively and charming post-prandial debate as the one we have just engaged in <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce of donington kept the temperature at its usual healthy level with the result that the debate was kept moving <e> <s> i shall attempt to cover the many points that have been raised in the debate on this series of amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i would remind my noble friend that we are at the report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords the subsection refers to keeping under review <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure your lordships that it is the governments intention to allow the objection procedures provided for in paragraph to be available not only when apparatus is first installed but also when it is significantly altered <e> <s> i hope that that takes care of what the noble lord spoke of earlier when he mentioned the maypole <e> <s> i must say that it is something which i have not yet seen but we shall doubtless look forward to it at a later stage in the year <e> <s> we believe that the existing draft of the paragraph already achieves the noble lords objective <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord stoddart moved his amendment with customary grace <e> <s> i think he will agree that certainly i am not a lawyer <e> <s> i do not know that he is <e> <s> i think i quote him correctly and i suspect he was reading from subparagraph of paragraph <e> <s> he will see and perhaps your lordships may see that after we have disposed of sub-paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of your lordships house perhaps i can try and explain the position to the noble lord lord stoddart <e> <s> i understand that any licence conditions for a telecommunications system will ensure that the occupiers right to serve a counter notice or indeed any of the other rights available to the occupier will be fully explained in any notice served by an operator <e> <s> so if an old person who was not too well acquainted with official forms were to receive a notice from an operator we would hope that the licence conditions would ensure that the rights of the occupier were clearly and fairly simply stated <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house and i would not want to stretch the rules of your lordships house further my instructions are that licence conditions will ensure the occupiers rights i understand that there are nodding movements to my left <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i shall seek to calm some of the concern in the mind of the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey and indeed that of his noble friends and any other of your lordships who might worry about the code of practice in the bill and whether this is the relevant area in which we should be seeking to insert a code of practice <e>", "<cs> my lords the available evidence does not suggest that the practice of dispensing short measure beer is widespread <e> <s> the secretary of state however recognises that all the while the law is capable of being interpreted differently in different parts of great britain and that an underlying current of doubt confusion and disquiet may remain <e> <s> discussions are therefore taking place with the interested parties to see whether an acceptable solution can be found <e> <s> the government hope to be able to make a statement shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the oversized glass is concerned i would stress to the noble lord that if beer were to be served in line measure glasses this would cause large bills for replacement of brim measures and ultimately mean higher prices for the consumer <e> <s> as for what the customer expects when he asks for a pint of beer of course that is for the courts to decide <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware that anywhere where the noble lord partakes of his tipple water was added to the mixture of whisky <e> <s> of course the noble lord and the house will be aware that if they come north of the border they tend to get one-fifth of a gill and not the measure south of the border <e> <s> perhaps if the noble lord would accompany me home at the weekend he might obtain greater satisfaction <e>", "<cs> my lords i take note of the noble viscounts comments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to receive that comment from my noble friend <e> <s> i am sure that the entire house will note my noble friends comments <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord and indeed your lordships would care to study the fascinating case of <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but i hoped that i was answering the question on what the customer expects when he asks for a pint <e> <s> the answer it has been suggested that i should convey to your lordships in this respect is that what does or does not constitute a pint of beer is a matter for the courts <e> <s> i shall refrain from going into a scottish case which was dealt with by the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey in an earlier incarnation <e> <s> in that case it was held north of the border that the customer expected to obtain a head on his beer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to my noble friend and i shall pay attention to his adage myself <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i am only able to quote the law as i find it <e> <s> i will not go further into the case and i will not quote the case but section of the act which the noble lord asked about has yet to be implemented <e> <s> my first answer goes to show that the government are aware of the problems and that we are taking it seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords the cable and broadcasting bill which has now completed its passage in your lordships house contains provisions for improving copyright protection which will benefit the entertainment industries <e> <s> on a wider front the government are committed to a comprehensive reform of the copyright law as soon as possible although no legislative timetable can yet be given <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid we cannot say at this stage what might happen as to future legislation since the details of the session have not yet been finalised but i am sure the noble earl will appreciate that the programme is certainly very crowded <e> <s> the government are aware of the problems which have been spelled out by the noble earl <e> <s> i believe he will agree and your lordships will agree that there are many problems but also many possible solutions <e> <s> i am able to tell the noble earl that the problem of home recording which i think is the main problem that affects the entertainment industries that concern him and the royalties lost as a result of home taping is currently under consideration by ministers <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> indeed i have the green paper here <e> <s> i seem to remember taking part in various discussions in your lordships house then and since <e> <s> we are very grateful for the noble lords continuing interest in this subject but as he will be aware the issues concerning copyright are very complex <e> <s> indeed the continuing involvement of new issues new technologies and a number of difficult and controversial issues has meant that continuing wide consultation is still necessary <e> <s> i am afraid the position has not advanced further since my last comments on this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords on the noble lords last question i shall do everthing i can to make my right honourable friends aware of the deep feeling that is felt not only by the noble lord but all round your lordships house <e> <s> the noble lord referred to point-to-point and satellite broadcasting <e> <s> on the letter to my right honourable friend the prime minister i regret that i was not aware of this but certainly i am grateful for the information <e> <s> the noble lord referred to the copyright reform group with which i surmise he has some connection <e>", "<cs> he does not i am sorry <e>", "<cs> my lords i am immensely grateful to the noble lord for his flattery <e> <s> he says every ounce <e> <s> i am trying to lose ounces every day <e> <s> indeed it is in part the hospitality in your lordships house that causes me to gain ounces <e> <s> i shall certainly take everything that the noble lord has said to my right honourable friend but i am sure that the noble lord and all your lordships would agree that with the increase in technology and the new issues that are arising such as satellite broadcasting if we are to legislate we must get it right <e> <s> there is no point in legislating and then in three four or even five years time finding that that legislation has been utterly overtaken <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord mentioned piracy <e> <s> i think that he will be aware that a private members bill dealing with video piracy has been through your lordships house and i think is coming up in another place <e> <s> as far as a departmental inquiry is concerned i shall convey that point to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords that depends on how widely these points are agreed <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord and indeed one or two of your lordships who spoke earlier would agree that there are one or two pressing issues but i stressed to the noble earl earlier in my <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend the minister of state <e> <s> scottish office i beg to move that this report be now received <e>", "<cs> my lords believe that it would be for the convenience of your lordships not least

telecom to assess the case for this in the light among other things of views expressed to them by the post office and by telephone and postal users <e>", "<cs> my lords did i hear my noble friend

shall inquire and will write to the noble lady <e>", "<cs> as i said my lords i shall inquire <e> <s> i shall inquire from the post office and will write to the noble earl <e> <s> but we receive ceaseless advice and have ceaseless requests from the post office to use post codes <e> <s> i am sure your lordships will agree that this is a matter for the consumer and a matter for the post office <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very interesting suggestion which i am sure the post office will note but i am sure my noble friend will be aware that the post office grants concessionary facilities to bulk users of the post if these users put post codes on all outgoing mail which is the subject of this concessionary rate <e>", "<cs> i understand that this is for all mail my lords <e> <s> for concessionary bulk postage i believe it is a separate class of mail on its own <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords perhaps i should have clarified the position <e> <s> it is that the post office grants additional concessions to those sending bulk mail who use post codes on outgoing mail <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly pass that message on my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that information on post codes is available in post offices in the post code directories <e> <s> i understand that these may be consulted in all crown offices <e> <s> i inquired about this and i understand that crown

difficulties perhaps she would let me know <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite correct but that does not prevent the government <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all i should like to thank both

prys-davies and for the welcome which he has given to this order <e> <s> the noble lord need have no fear that we were unable to follow the line of his questions because he laid them out in an admirably clear and concise way <e> <s> i hope that with just a little debutantes luck i shall be able to give the noble lord clear and fairly satisfactory answers to the queries that he has raised this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft fines and penalties northern ireland order which was laid before the house on th march be approved <e> <s> your lordships will see that

from many of the measures and many of the contents of the criminal justice act <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with no little interest and with gratitude to the kind words that have been spoken by the right reverend prelate the noble lord lord dunleath and the noble lord lord underhill especially on this occasion which is my first major effort on a very far-ranging and wide-ranging debate which concerns so many people in northern ireland and so many subjects which are vital to the life of the province <e>", "<cs> my lords any of your lordships who have sat and listened to the debates which we have had on northern ireland there have been many over the years will agree that the contribution just made by the noble lord lord fitt has been well worth the wait

interesting things the noble lord has said and above all that he is aware of the points of wisdom which are of great interest to comparative newcomers to the province like myself <e> <s> i hasten to add that i have been a student of the affairs of northern ireland certainly over or years <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first of all thank all your lordships who have listened to my exposition of a field

have spoken and i am very grateful for the comments that have been made which as i understand it were entirely of approbation <e> <s> i am also very grateful to the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> i am sure he will be pleased to be reminded that in <e> <s> i think january of last year certainly before i inherited the position which i now hold he stressed the urgency of the matter that was under consideration and said that we must implement the points made by sir frank harrison in his earlier capacity <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord is quite right there <e> <s> i shall leave my remarks as they are but i am sure the noble lord lord hampton will accept the point that was made by the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> i am grateful to him for pointing that out <e> <s> i am very grateful to the noble lord lord fitt <e> <s> i have been searching desperately through the schedules to find dock ward though he warned me that i would not find it there <e> <s> i hope that even the noble lord will admit that there are other fascinating and quaint names <e> <s> the little so-called wards will not mean much to the noble lord if they are redrawn and fresh interesting and imaginative new names have to be found for them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that your lordships will be immensely impressed and grateful for the very close attention which has been given to this order this evening <e> <s> the noble lord lord houghton who takes such a close interest in these matters opened with a fair attack upon the government and the usual channels for permitting such matters to be discussed at a late hour <e> <s> this has been a fascinating discussion and a far higher proportion of those of your lordships who are actually in the chamber have spoken than certainly on any other measures when i have been present <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord and all of your lordships will agree that the quality of debate and discussion and as the noble lord lord prys-davies has put it the interrogation of ministers and of the government has been at an exceptional level this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i think my case will rest if we could pursue this <e> <s> i shall write to the noble lord if he has a specific point <e> <s> we believe that it should be satisfactorily placed in schedule <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if the noble lord does not agree but i must get on with this otherwise we shall be with the curlew all evening <e> <s> i appreciate the strength of the noble lords feeling but i hope he will accept that we believe that the curlew receives adequate protection apart from the question of its attributes <e> <s> it may or may not be edible i shall not ask my noble friend lord massereene whether it is <e> <s> we have heard his records of other birds <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> i understand this does not breed and does not qualify in <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may take that up with my advisers and write to the noble lord <e> <s> we may in the course of our discussions discover that this creature is really a bird of passage and not a resident <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps we might define what is meant by winter when snow comes in october and classify the bird under schedule part i the noble lord also mentioned the american belted kingfisher <e> <s> i look around your lordships house and wonder whether we are blessed with one of this species <e> <s> but if species such as this appear and appear from observation likely to breed they will certainly be placed in this schedule <e> <s> i stress to your lordships that if such a bird appeared and was taken harmed or killed the offender would be liable to be fined up to which i think is scale in the list of penalties at the back of the order <e>", "<cs> at least i have satisfied the noble lord on one of his questions and i am delighted <e> <s> a note of triumph has been sounded <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin by thanking the noble lords lord cledwyn and lord hampton for the words that they have expressed about the bereaved and the injured <e> <s> i shall certainly ensure that their good wishes and their tributes to the security forces and above all to the brave men and women of the royal ulster constabulary are passed on <e> <s> i am most grateful for them <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not have any plans to reconsider any measures of capital punishment <e> <s> indeed in july both your lordships house and another place rejected a proposal to reintroduce capital punishment and above all for acts of terrorism <e> <s> i believe that it would be the opinion of your lordships that despite this particular series of atrocities which i have had the misfortune to announce today the position has not changed since then <e> <s> indeed we believe that the effects of such a step would in the long-term prove counter-productive by making it much more difficult to bring terrorists to justice and that would strengthen their support and certainly destabilise society in the province <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful for the forthright excellent and kind support from the noble lord lord blease who of course has contributed so much to life in northern ireland and still contributes so much <e> <s> so far as concerns the noble lords comment on this apalling tragedy reflecting upon everybody in northern ireland and indeed on everyone in ireland perhaps i could draw your lordships attention to the opening paragraph of a statement issued by dr fitzgerald on the evening of the newry atrocity <e> <s> he said <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole house and people far outside your lordships house will appreciate the comments made by the noble lord who after all has such experience of facing up to this problem of the appalling violence and terrorism himself <e> <s> for my part and indeed i am sure on behalf of all your lordships i salute his courage over many years <e> <s> his comments over the weekend are all the more valuable for his experiences <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure we would all agree with the observation made by the noble lord <e> <s> lord hylton at the beginning of his remarks that we are all getting prime time and that we should use that time which is so valuable to your lordships as effectively as we can <e> <s> for my part i believe that we have had an excellent and thorough debate scrutinising the entire order and the estimates <e> <s> i am more than impressed i am very grateful for the attention that has been paid by noble lords to the supplementary estimates <e> <s> vote has been mentioned several times as has vote and vote <e> <s> it is very gratifying that we use prime time in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i recall the noble lord asking me why <e> <s> that will be one of the points on which i shall write to him <e> <s> i am sorry that i cannot go further today on that particular point <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly take that on board and see if i am able to give what the noble lord calls an omnibus reply <e> <s> in any case i think there are new arrangements which prevail in your lordships house <e> <s> i shall see what i can do <e> <s> with that i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft local elections northern ireland order which was laid before your lordships on th february he approved <e>", "<cs> my lords once again we are very grateful that after a lengthy afternoon on northern irish affairs the noble lord lord prys-davies the noble lord lord hampton and the noble lord lord fitt have found the time to discuss and to examine this interesting complicated and technical order <e> <s> the noble lord lord prys-davis raised the question of pr and stv though not necessarily in those terms but certainly he raised the question of proportional representation <e> <s> i have to say to your lordships that when i see pr or stv it has to be forcefully dinned into me that stv does not stand for scottish television because where i come from that is exactly what it stands for <e> <s> i find the systems of pr interesting <e>", "<cs> briefly my lords and just once <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl should know that i am never unduly hard <e> <s> the umpire in this game is indeed your lordships house <e> <s> i stand by what i said <e> <s> there is no system <e> <s> i think that he is drawing semantic points <e> <s> we may discuss this later if he will permit that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just finish <e>", "<cs> no my lords if the noble earl makes sedentary remarks it breaks up the speech <e> <s> i am not a lawyer and i do not think he is <e> <s> will he just pause <e> <s> he has said that he wishes to interrupt <e> <s> i believe that i am on the verge of being too good mannered but i shall finish this paragraph and then let him say what he wishes <e> <s> i am in the middle of trying to deal with uncorroborated evidence <e> <s> i do not think that for the government to legislate to make evidence inadmissible in northern ireland would be in the interests of justice <e> <s> it would require courts in northern ireland to disregard evidence which might be cogent and material and which might otherwise lead to the conviction of persons for very serious crime <e> <s> i would remind your lordships and above all the noble earl that such accomplice evidence although sometimes uncorroborated is never put forward unless it is supported by other evidence for example of the commission of the offences in question which while not strictly corroborative nonetheless tends to confirm the accomplices story <e> <s> i do not think that parliament should supplant the discretion at present accorded to the courts to accept reject or give such weight as they see fit to such evidence with a rigid rule that no such evidence should ever in any circumstances be admissible <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord mentions to all intents and purposes but i understand that my remarks still stand <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness will no doubt be aware that this particular act has been in existence since <e> <s> it has been reviewed every year including the years and when the government supported by the noble baroness did the reviewing and saw fit to continue it <e> <s> i can tell the noble baroness and your lordships that it has been reviewed this year but there are no plans at present to bring forward proposals to repeal this particular act <e> <s> i would stress to the noble baroness and to your lordships that the total amount of debt outstanding is million <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may inquire further from the noble lord and then write to him <e> <s> this is a special case as your lordships will appreciate <e> <s> there will be a combination of many factors with many different allowances and at least two separate acts which would empower the deductions <e> <s> possibly if i may write to the noble lord we could take this further <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of how these deductions are made from the various allowances is a complicated formula <e> <s> may i write to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall need to <e> <s> i shall need to do this otherwise i shall be detaining your lordships for a good hour this afternoon <e> <s> i am sure the noble baroness will appreciate that <e> <s> we take note of motions by the assembly but the noble baroness and your lordships will also note that the th report of the public accounts committee published in july recommended that the departments and bodies concerned including the northern ireland department should continue to seek ways of improving control over debt and should keep under regular review the effectiveness of the methods which they use <e>", "<cs> my lords on the last point perhaps i may write to the noble lord since he clearly knows that there is an appeal mechanism <e> <s> i am sorry that it is not more widely known <e> <s> i shall endeavour to find out and i shall write to the noble lord <e> <s> the noble lord is quite correct in that the rent and rates strike ceased but the noble lord will be aware that the debts continue to pile up <e> <s> as i stressed to your lordships at present the debts stand at million <e> <s> they are being paid off at an average rate last year of million <e> <s> your lordships will see that there is a colossal debt <e> <s> nevertheless million was paid last year under this act <e>", "<cs> my lords on the last point if i can i shall but i advise the noble lord that it might be extremely difficult and will be at disproportionate cost <e> <s> i do not believe that we are discriminating against northern ireland <e> <s> i am sure your lordships will agree that the scale of the problem is unique to northern ireland and as your lordships have heard it was brought on by a rent and rates strike which may have ceased in but the debts are still with us <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for asking this question <e> <s> my noble friend has indicated to me that the case is as i thought that when i write to the noble lord and to your lordships copies of those letters should be made available in a certain form in the library <e> <s> i must confess that i had not yet discovered this but i shall do so <e> <s> that is probably one more point that the noble lord might be worried about <e>", "<cs> my lords it is under review every year as i told the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have any information about money taken from wages <e> <s> i understand that the main recovery methods under the act concern the seven different benefits which are spelled out in section of the act <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will know that case is a complicated one in which a number of factors will be taken into account <e> <s> i have promised to write to the noble lord and i shall certainly do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the attention that has been paid to this statement and especially for <e>", "<cs> my lords briefly may i say that i shall certainly convey the concern felt by your lordships to my right honourable friend <e> <s> however i would stress to the noble lord lord mishcon and to your lordships that this particular problem has been in the headlines of both northern ireland daily newspapers and sunday newspapers <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord lord mishcon saw them over the weekend but i certainly did not although i believe that they are generally available <e> <s> i understand that the problem has been on the headlines of both channels of <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank all three noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> i thank first the noble lord lord prys-davies for summarising very accurately and concisely the

spoken and indeed to the right reverend prelate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i shall take careful note of what he says and on some future occasion when we are discussing some analogous matter i might be able to assist my noble friend <e> <s> the winged messengers have informed me that the regulations would be made by the department of the environment in northern ireland <e> <s> however i understand that covers only part of what my noble friend was asking and i think it will also relate to what my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter said <e> <s> the regulations would be made by the department of the environment in northern ireland but the testing would be done by the department of transport on an agency basis <e> <s> i hope that will further help my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> i certainly take on board what my noble friend lord renton has said and i hope that we shall see something clearer emerge if called for in further legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful once again to the noble lord lord prys-davies and indeed to the noble lord lord mcnair the right reverend prelate and your lordships who have studied this order which is before us <e> <s> the noble lord lord prys-davies paid some particularly nice compliments to the work done by the assembly and i am sure that his kind words will be read with considerable approval by the members of the assembly and indeed by the members of the committee which considered this order <e> <s> we are always grateful for appreciation from your lordships house and from elsewhwere and i shall certainly see that the noble lords remarks are brought to the attention of those members of the assembly who contributed to the discussions there and above all to the assembly committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the point made quite rightly by the noble earl <e> <s> i assure him and other noble lords that i have sat and listened with fascination to the points which have been raised by your lordships today <e> <s> i am very grateful for the interest that has been shown in all parts of the house <e> <s> i must stress that it is only good manners and i should try to reply to noble lords who have spoken and to respond satisfactorily and succinctly to as many points as i can including those of which i received prior notification as is the custom in such matters <e> <s> i shall attempt to answer them all <e> <s> if i fail to do so no doubt your lordships will pick me up on them and i will then be in touch through the usual channels by writing to your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to have to say that i do not know <e> <s> i shall certainly find out <e> <s> i shall add my support to what i have already said <e> <s> if that is not in a satisfactory form of course i shall seek out the information and write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords in seconds i would add my personal congratulations to barry mcguigan and indeed to all the sportsmen <e> <s> i was pleased that the noble lord mentioned dunlop <e> <s> i call him armoy joey <e> <s> it is mr joey dunlop <e> <s> all the sporting heroes of ulster provide much happiness for everyone throughout the united kingdom <e> <s> they are shining examples throughout the world of sportsmanship and of the warmth of ulster people something which i have experienced for months <e> <s> i hope that the sports council can be of assistance <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords the debate has been notable not only for the return of the noble lord lord underhill from whom i hope we shall hear a great performance at the next chance that we have as he becomes more and more fit but for the valuable thoughts and fascinating remarks of the noble lord lord fitt of which i take note <e> <s> he made an interesting comment that this might be one of his shorter speeches <e> <s> it was valuable all the same <e> <s> in the short time that the usual channels have granted us for the first debate this week on the situation in northern ireland i believe that we have covered an enormous amount and done justice to the subject to everyone who has spoken and to northern ireland <e> <s> by the by i do not think that we have irritated too many of the usual channels or your lordships generally <e>", "<cs> my lords as all your lordships who have attended this debate have seen we have had a short but i believe a very valuable debate and in the last seconds an excellent and humorous interchange between the noble lord lord fitt and the noble lord lord hylton <e> <s> i hesitate to intervene on these tercentenaries <e> <s> we have had a debate on various issues which are of the very greatest importance to everyone in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i cannot do so now but we take the point on board <e> <s> i am afraid that i cannot give the noble lord that assurance this afternoon <e> <s> the noble lord also asked about allowing persons who have been charged with offences in northern ireland to be tried in a different jurisdiction that is in great britain <e> <s> we see no case for that <e> <s> as for compensating persons who are held on remand in accordance with the law should they ultimately be found not guilty again we find no real case for that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the historic churches northern ireland order a draft of which was laid before your lordships this year be approved <e>", "<cs> it is cold and wet my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all noble lords who have taken part in the debate <e> <s> i shall certainly take into account the suggestions made by the noble lord lord fitt in his concluding remarks <e> <s> however we must remember that an afternoon like this in your lordships house is a family occasion and perhaps we had better not go into all the things that he gets up to and the exercise that he may take of an afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords always when filling in the dinner hour we have what i regard as extremely entertaining and crisp debates <e> <s> tonight is no exception <e> <s> the noble lord lord prys-davies was correct in saying that the order now before us contains a very large number of provisions <e> <s> however the noble lord does himself a little less than justice in suggesting that perhaps the opposition benches i suggest these benches too need many experts <e> <s> the noble lord covers several fields himself and i pay tribute to him on the very wide range of talents which he deploys on these matters not least tonights order <e> <s> i shall not spare your lordships <e> <s> there is another order to come and i look forward to hearing what the noble lord says about that <e>", "<cs> my lords when he refers to the proposed arrangements does the noble lord mean the whole order <e> <s> i think one of my winged messengers sent me a message about ear piercing whether they misheard the noble lord i do not know which said no difference <e> <s> i think that in many cases the arrangements that are being made in this particular order are very much akin to english and welsh law <e> <s> i recall that in a previous incarnation when i was helping my noble friend lord mansfield with the scottish local government miscellaneous provisions bill we had matters of all kinds such as taxis and window cleaners <e> <s> i think that the order before us tonight is bringing many of the activities that are regulated by district councils in northern ireland into line with the procedures on the mainland though of course retaining the distinct character of northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the credit unions northern ireland order the draft of which was laid before your lordships house on th june be approved <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may deal with the points raised by the noble lord lord blease at the conclusion of my remarks though perhaps i should say that i must not become too much involved in the constitutional affairs nor indeed in the more turbulent affairs of your lordships house <e> <s> if i may i shall compose my thoughts on that particular issue <e> <s> nevertheless i was more than grateful for the noble lords support and indeed for the support of all your lordships for credit unions all the more for the expertise that came quite unexpectedly at least to me but i am all the more grateful for it from the noble lord lord gallacher <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord <e> <s> lord fitt and others of your lordships make possibly the valid point that there are rather few noble lords who make a habit of attending these sometimes technical and sometimes esoteric debates that we have on various orders concerning northern ireland <e> <s> i would stress to the noble lord lord fitt and to your lordships that there is more than a grain of truth in the fact that we do have very high-quality speeches and a great degree of knowledge expressed here in our deliberations as has been shown once again during our debate on the order this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the betting gaming lotteries and amusements northern ireland order a draft of which was laid before this house on th june be approved <e> <s> your lordships may have thought we were debating <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord prys-davies and the noble lord lord fitt for taking part in the discussion of this order <e> <s> i am pleased that the noble lord lord fitt has been able to give us if i may put it so vulgarly the benefit of his experience <e> <s> however i will say more about that later if time permits i am aware that your lordships have other business and i will try not to delay that for too long <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble earls first

the whole house that those who seek to overthrow democracy in northern ireland by terrorist violence can have no recognised role in resolving any of the problems of northern ireland <e> <s> as for my noble friends second supplementary question he and indeed your lordships will be pleased to know that my <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very grateful of course for the first part of the noble lords supplementary question <e> <s> so far as the second part is concerned i am afraid that that is another question and i must say wait and see <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord and your lordships will be well aware that there are million citizens in northern ireland with little or no interest in reunification <e> <s> indeed that section of the population forms a majority in that part of the united kingdom <e> <s> the noble lord and the house will be perfectly well aware that it is a long-standing principle of democracy and above all of self-determination that the wishes of the majority on a constitutional question such as this should prevail and indeed will prevail <e> <s> i hasten to stress to the noble lord that this need for consent is accepted by the government of the republic of ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not be in a position to comment on that <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to all noble lords who have spoken on this somewhat technical order together with the more technical points of legislation which have been rightly raised by the noble lord lord prys-davies <e> <s> i stress to the noble lord and to all noble lords that the order is fairly short <e> <s> it has been introduced just now with one specific purpose and that is to provide for the regulation of laser techniques in the removal of tattoos <e> <s> i am given to understand that the order will enable the dhss in northern ireland the necessary powers but as to the implementation of those powers and as to who will be responsible perhaps i may inform the noble lord lord blease that i have taken his question on board and hope to be able to inform him about that before the end of the debate <e> <s> if that is not possible i shall write in detail to him <e>", "<cs> i should love to my

grateful for the points raised by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to thank both noble lords who have spoken so far for their forthright support for the government and indeed for the anglo-irish agreement <e> <s> if i may try to cover the points raised by the noble lord lord prys-davies first we are of course grateful for his reassertion that there can never be any excuse for violence <e> <s> secondly of course he is absolutely right yesterday was a tragedy for the province <e> <s> i pointed out in the statement made by my right honourable friend that pictures in the media and in the printed form have gone all round the world showing what all of us know to be the unacceptable face of ulster <e> <s> however those of your lordships who have had the privilege and have it still of serving in ulster know that hopefully that is a false picture <e> <s> but of course there are no winners of any strike or of any events like those of yesterday <e> <s> the only beneficiaries of yesterdays events were terrorists and the enemies of democracy and i believe one more important group the competitors of ulster in the commercial and trade world <e>", "<cs> my lords of course all of us are grateful to have a voice from northern ireland and if i may say so a voice from county fermanagh speaking in your lordships house this afternoon <e> <s> i am sure that all of us would wish to join my noble friend who is so involved in life in northern ireland in his tributes to the security forces and to the royal ulster constabulary <e> <s> i am afraid that i am not aware of any conversations that my noble friend had with my noble friend the leader of the house <e> <s> i am sure that my <e>", "<cs> my lords i said earlier that people had been dealt with by the police and that summonses for proceedings have been taken out against that number <e> <s> there has been a number of arrests as well <e> <s> i do not have a break-down <e> <s> i do not know who all those persons were or what was their persuasion <e> <s> as to proscribing any organistion i hope that indications have made clear that we intend to take firm action in relation to any organisation but the question is not really one that i can answer this afternoon as it is far too complicated <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful for my noble friends thoughts on our communications with the leaders of the unionist party <e> <s> he could not have put the case better <e> <s> i certainly could not have put it better <e> <s> i am grateful to him for putting it just in this way <e> <s> i am sure that he and your lordships will agree that the main question is to try to re-establish <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful for the interest in this matter shown by the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe <e> <s> his point has been reiterated as i have stressed and stress again that the beneficiaries of yesterdays events were terrorists enemies of democracy and ulsters commercial competitors <e> <s> during the past week i have been seeing reports <e> <s> i am sure that everybody in northern ireland cannot have been unaware of appeals from bodies such as the idb and the chairman of harland and wolff and shorts that events such as those which took place yesterday can only be of benefit to the commercial competitors of northern ireland and in the long run do immeasurable damage to job prospects in northern ireland <e> <s> i am sure that everybody in northern ireland is aware of that <e> <s> we just hope that they will take cognisance of it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is so much more experienced in the ways of diplomacy and in your lordships house than i am <e> <s> i learnt probably from the noble lord not to try to bet on a hypothesis <e> <s> we take note of the strong feeling in your lordships house and of what the noble lord said but i should not want to comment on that today <e> <s> i am grateful to him for the additional lesson <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is hardly within my province to forswear this <e> <s> it is what people wish to call themselves <e> <s> perhaps it is a label <e> <s> may we discuss this at a later stage with my noble friend <e> <s> i shall certainly convey it to my right honourable friend but i suspect that this label may be with us for a number of years yet <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord lord hunt for his continuing interest in northern ireland and we are especially grateful after all that he has done over the years <e> <s> as far as i am aware there have been no complaints <e> <s> i do not know of any <e> <s> i am not able to differentiate between any formal complaints against the ruc the army or the ulster defence regiment <e> <s> i do not know <e> <s> the only point that i have been able to confirm to your lordships and would confirm again to the noble lord lord hunt is that the chief constable will be issuing a full report <e> <s> i reiterate that the chief constable is prepared to consider and will fully consider any incident of what i have called indifferent policing and will make a very full investigation of any such incident <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have to leave that to the two gentlemen who had a meeting with my right honourable friend the prime minister last tuesday <e> <s> i am not exactly aware of what was said or where it was <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord was present on th november last year <e> <s> he will have heard all the <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank the noble baroness for that very helpful suggestion <e> <s> certainly i will do everything i can to suggest to all my friends in the media that they should see the acceptable and wonderful face of ulster that i have learned to know and which the noble baroness and indeed all your lordships know <e> <s> we do take note of the kind and helpful suggestion of the noble baroness <e> <s> i shall certainly pass it on to my right honourable friend and my colleagues <e> <s> i am sure that her remarks will bear fruit <e>", "<cs> my lords we are immensely grateful for the interest shown by noble lords who have <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord as always is lightning fast rather like the irish threequarters on saturday afternoon and i am pleased that the noble lord is keeping up their momentum <e> <s> i have received <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to your lordships for taking so long to go through the order but as your lordships will be aware it is a very complicated matter <e> <s> the debate we have had since i sat down shows that there were many points that interested your lordships and that i am afraid i was not able to cover first time round the course <e> <s> i hope that i shall have more luck than some of the great jockeys at the steeplechases when i come round the second time but i shall hang on <e>", "<cs> my lords i do apologise i should have taken that up <e> <s> that point was also mentioned by my noble friend lord broxbourne <e> <s> i am not able to say definitely whether i can get what might be called a simplified ministers guide to this <e> <s> may i look into this and see if there is a chance of having a guide or if indeed we can find simplified notes of sorts so that what we call the layman might have some idea of the provisions of the order <e> <s> of course noble lords will be aware that many of the provisions in the order will be in the field of my noble friend lord broxbourne and indeed my noble friend lord colville <e> <s> it will be much more of a lawyers field and i have covered the point of legal aid <e> <s> if i may look into his query and see if it is feasible to provide some simplified guidance or notes would that satisfy the noble lord tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may finally reply i have two points <e> <s> certainly my noble friend lord colville stressed that this order had an input and certainly i had stressed this from all round the united kingdom <e> <s> secondly i do not know if the noble lord took on board all the points made by the noble viscount lord colville but i found that my noble friend did explain these aspects very clearly <e>", "<cs> my lords i the government and i am sure your lordships will be immensely grateful for the very high level of debate and the concentration that there has been on wide aspects of the order that we have before us this evening and for the wide-ranging subjects which were covered by two of my noble friends my noble friends lord moyola and lord brookeborough <e> <s> he has once again caught me out <e> <s> i am afraid that this afternoon i am not wearing one of my proudest possessions <e> <s> my county fermanagh tie is packed ready to go with me on various journeys <e> <s> i assure him that my love affair with the county of fermanagh is undying and as strong as ever <e>", "<cs> i said need not necessarily my lords <e> <s> perhaps we can leave it there <e> <s> i am sure that if the noble lord wants to take part in the deliberations that might be carried on at a later date in your lordships house he may elicit a little further information <e>", "<cs> my lords we are particularly grateful for the support which has been given by the noble lord lord prys-davies and the noble lord lord donaldson <e> <s> above all on a personal basis i should like to add my tribute to the brave men and women of the royal ulster constabulary <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the royal ulster constabulary will be particularly grateful for the tribute paid by the noble lord lord hunt <e> <s> i shall see that his words are noted by everybody in northern ireland and by the royal ulster constabulary <e> <s> as your lordships will know he has a unique connection with northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful for the thoughts and good wishes of the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i shall see that the noble lords tributes to the royal ulster constabulary are passed on <e> <s> all of us admire the noble lord for his courageous efforts in his political life in west belfast as he has described them somewhat humbly in your lordships house <e> <s> all of us know what he had to put up with <e> <s> we shall see that his words of commendation are passed on to the chief constable <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord prys-davies for his observations on what we have sought to achieve by this order <e> <s> the noble lord picked up the point that we have altered article to try to accommodate the student population <e> <s> indeed this was something of an education to me because i was not aware that the students started working for the academic year in july preferably just after the week-end of th july <e> <s> instantly they get down to work for the next weekend <e> <s> this is a lesson that i have learnt as a result of the deliberations in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord referred to the measures that i mentioned in my original answer <e> <s> i mentioned a million programme <e> <s> of that million will be applicable this year <e> <s> there will be up to more jobs through community enterprise and enterprise ulster and we hope that there will be new jobs through the ledu enterprise grant and new jobs under the new workers scheme which is for and year-olds <e> <s> those measures are relevant to northern ireland and we believe that the figures i have quoted are encouraging <e> <s> we believe that the measures will make progress towards resolving the problem mentioned by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i can only answer for northern ireland which is the subject of the question on the order paper <e> <s> we intend to see that the figures i mentioned drop thanks to the measures that i mentioned to the noble lord and your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords to take one element of regional aid unique to northern ireland our local enterprise development unit announced yesterday its job promotion figures for <e> <s> these were slightly below target at for this year compared with a target of <e> <s> but the ledu in northern ireland this is particularly applicable to the noble lord with his interest in scotland exceeded its target in each of the previous four years <e> <s> indeed over five years the target of jobs created by this important arm of regional policy was exceeded by which is over per cent <e> <s> i hope therefore that the noble lord will accept that this arm of regional policy has been a great success in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will i believe accept that what he asks is a little wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> i have given some of the measures that we believe are relevant to reducing unemployment <e> <s> the question that the noble lord has raised relating to letters from the niedc is a little wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> if the noble lord puts down a fresh question i shall endeavour to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall take on board the points that the noble lord has raised and pass them on to my honourable friend in respect of the department of health and social services in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords the young people on the new worker scheme might take issue with the noble lord <e> <s> they are in work <e> <s> they are gaining useful work experience and being paid for this youth training <e> <s> they would i believe take issue with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asks what happens at the end of their training <e> <s> they are receiving training <e> <s> there are measures altogether <e> <s> i shall not detail them but there are nine others apart from that in which the noble lord showed interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i take on board my noble friends point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for pointing this out <e> <s> i understand that the figures in northern ireland are broadly comparable and that the scheme that i have mentioned has been and continues to be of the greatest benefit to young people <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful for that question from the noble lord <e> <s> he is absolutely right <e> <s> it is the duty of everyone especially those in public life in northern ireland to support any measures we can take to promote investment and industry in the province <e> <s> we are grateful to the noble lord for his help <e>", "<cs> my lords if the northern ireland economic development council regard those as inadequate i can only quote one of my scottish friends as saying that that is its opinion <e> <s> there are nine other measures <e> <s> i shall not detail all of them <e> <s> i believe however that the niedc would agree that measures taken by the government especially as a result of the budget are going a considerable way to reduce unemployment in northern ireland <e> <s> it might not be exactly what the niedc wants but the council would agree i believe that our efforts are worthwhile and considerable <e>", "<cs> my lords may i briefly reply to the noble lord lord prys-davies and the noble lord lord donaldson and thank both noble lords and especially the noble lord lord prys-davies for his welcome of the statement that i read out <e> <s> we believe that the statement that i have read out today and what has happened need not be the end of the road <e> <s> we hope that it is not for an elected assembly acting constructively as many of us believe they did until fairly recently is a valuable institution <e> <s> we want to have a new election when attitudes change and that is particularly important <e>", "<cs> my lords i immediately refute the two words to which the noble lord referred hypocrisy and incompetence <e> <s> i do not think any fair and unbiased observer would label the efforts of this government and indeed successive governments in the past with those two words the noble lord mentioned at least three times the word abolition <e> <s> may i stress to him especially and to your lordships that we are not abolishing the assembly we are dissolving it <e> <s> there is a major difference <e>", "<cs> my lords the opening service if i may put it that way of the noble lord lord monson was getting quite away from todays statement <e> <s> however he referred to scrutiny in dealing with northern ireland parliamentary and political arrangements <e> <s> the opening statement stressed that my right honourable friend the prime minister would be very willing to <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first deal with the noble lords last point <e> <s> he is getting a little wide of the somewhat narrow track that i beat this afternoon in regard to the statement <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will go over this again when we debate the order which we shall be doing at a future date <e> <s> perhaps i may then be able to approach the noble lords question and do a little more justice to it <e> <s> i think that your lordships would not wish me to go too far down that path this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very interesting thought and we are very grateful to the noble lord for raising it <e> <s> may i ask him whether we might cover that a little more fully when we debate the whole of this order which we shall be doing i hope in the near future <e> <s> it is one part of the political argument that is under way at the moment in northern ireland <e> <s> as i suggested to your lordships we believe that devolution is the best avenue but perhaps we may leave discussion of that particular aspect to a later date <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i have guarded my words suitably about the time at which we shall come to debate this order but it will be in the near future <e> <s> that is all i will indicate to the noble lord <e> <s> we are very grateful for his forthright support for the efforts that are made by everybody particularly by the government and all of those who seek to assist in the political life of northern ireland <e> <s> but the noble lord rightly stresses that all of us are seeking after peace and prosperity in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> please continue <e>", "<cs> my lords as your lordships will appreciate we are all immensely grateful for the patience shown and the high quality of the contributions made by noble lords in the debate this evening especially on the order that is before us <e>", "<cs> my lords i see no other member of your lordships house who wishes to suggest that i might desist from speaking <e> <s> i shall speak for thirty seconds and express my gratitude to the noble lord lord graham for his welcome of these orders <e> <s> i was in his position some years ago and i never ceased to take an opportunity to tease the minister <e> <s> i am exceedingly grateful that the noble lord did not start working through or more sections tonight <e> <s> he may note that even at this late hour i may call in aid my noble and learned friend <e> <s> may i say to the noble lord lord graham that the joint committee on consolidation bills seem to have examined all these orders which seem to mirror united kingdom legislation <e> <s> they seek to bring northern ireland company legislation and commercial dealings up to date <e> <s> i say again that i am very grateful to the noble lord for his reception of them and i am also grateful to your lordships for allowing me to move all four orders <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly pass on the encomia which have been set forth by the noble lord lord graham <e> <s> above all i am very grateful for the tribute to the department of economic development <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will be aware the expenditure of block grants and recurrent funds in universities is a matter for the university concerned but i would stress that the university of ulster for the academic year will have a recurrent grant of million a five per cent <e> <s> increase on the block grant for this year <e> <s> of course we will take on board the points raised by the noble lord and i am sure the university of ulster will do likewise <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly pass on the noble lords words and i am sure that my honourable friend who is responsible for these matters in northern ireland will take close account of everything that has been said in your lordships house this morning together with the words of praise and encomium <e>", "<cs> my lords as always we are very grateful for the close attention paid by all your lordships to my impassioned remarks at the start of this debate <e> <s> we have bi-annual or perhaps tri-annual debates on the estimates for northern ireland and it provides us with an opportunity to discuss any major points of concern in the province as well as many others which i shall come to later including the cushendall cottage hospital <e> <s> i am pleased that the noble lord lord fitt takes on board that perhaps he too has been snowed-up there in winter but we shall possibly hear about that another day <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i shall reply succinctly and swiftly to the noble lord lord graham and i commend him upon a passionate speech on this order <e> <s> even he has stressed that it brings northern ireland into line with what we hope will be the case in the united kingdom <e> <s> i stress to the noble lord that such legislation is a priority <e> <s> we want to bring in legislation to ensure that we are in step with the rest of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i shall not necessarily need to do that <e> <s> i take the noble lords point but i do stress that we have only the orlit type of dwelling in the list of or so defective types of prc dwelling so far designated in great britain <e> <s> i hope the noble lord accepts that <e> <s> if there is any further technicality i shall write to him i hope more fully than i have been able to speak tonight <e> <s> i hope that i have covered the point <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that bad workman-ship is uncommon but where we find it i think that it will be covered by the different types of prc defects which we attempt to cover with this particular order <e> <s> i take the point concerning the question of bad workmanship but perhaps that can be dealt with another day <e> <s> if your lordships will allow me i beg to commend the order to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lords lord prys-davies and lord blease for their forbearance <e> <s> i am afraid that i shall have to write to the noble lord lord prys-davies in respect of all his queries apart from his thoughts on the area of social need <e> <s> i am advised that there is no statutory definition of an area of social need in northern ireland or in great britain where this phrase is used in the inner urban areas act <e> <s> we take it that an area of social need is generally recognised as one where deprivation is above the norm <e> <s> an example would be an area of high unemployment of poverty of poor housing and environment or where there are high demands on the social services or low educational achievement <e> <s> the precise mix and combination of these factors may vary from area to area <e> <s> the overall impact is such that what we call social need exists <e> <s> i would stress that such deprivation is normally associated with urban areas <e> <s> that is the matter with which we are dealing this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i have not pre-empted any of your lordships who may wish to add anything <e> <s> we are very grateful for the close attention that has been paid to this rather complicated act and order <e> <s> we are also grateful for the detailed points that have been raised by your lordships in such a good-humoured reasonable and kind way <e> <s> however at the outset i have one confession to make <e>", "<cs> i have glanced through my brief and i see that there is nothing there and so i must have added an <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord has a little patience he will discover that one form of driving on his side of the border does not equate with our side of the border <e> <s> he will be able to take part in the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house will be grateful for the close attention to detail of both noble lords <e> <s> i was particularly grateful to the noble lord lord prys-davies for saying that he proposed to delay the implementation of this order which deals with speeds considerably higher than those which he or i are able to achieve on the roads for no more than five minutes <e> <s> i pay tribute to the noble lord the questions that he raised had also crossed my mind and they are the questions that i should have asked had i been asking for detailed guidance on this <e>", "<cs> my lords once again we are very grateful for the scrutiny of this order by the noble lord lord prys-davies <e> <s> i shall pass on his kind words to my honourable friend the member for chelsea whose name and picture your lordships may have seen recently in the newspapers <e> <s> he has beaten the record of service of the noble lords honourable friend and <e> <s> indeed my honourable friend is well into his fifth year and very close to his sixth year of service in the province <e>", "<cs> my lords there is hope for all of us possibly even for myself <e> <s> i hope that i shall be given the time and the opportunity to continue this service <e> <s> but certainly i shall pass on the kind words of the noble lord lord prys-davies <e>", "<cs> my lords naturally i am immensely grateful for the attention that has been paid to this order by the two noble lords and by others who have spoken <e> <s> i am sure that your lordships will forgive me if i take five seconds of your time to welcome back the noble lord lord fitt <e> <s> our deliberations are always enlightened by his presence either in silence or in speech <e> <s> we are particularly delighted to see that he is back fit and i mean no pun this early in the evening and well <e> <s> when we see the noble lord our hearts leap in expectation <e> <s> we are delighted to see him back this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that there are no misprints in the title of this order <e> <s> i beg to move that the draft financial provisions northern ireland order which was laid before your lordships on st july be approved <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i shall be able to assist the noble lord lord hampton <e> <s> perhaps i may briefly try to answer first the two queries raised by the noble lord lord graham of edmonton <e> <s> i think he was interested in article and the fees <e> <s> i understand that article covers the provisions which relate to fees for the registration of catering establishments and outside caterers <e> <s> the percentage used in the calculation of registration fees which are payable by these establishments is paid to the northern ireland tourist board because the northern ireland tourist board issue registration certificates <e> <s> they have legislative backing under section of the development of tourist traffic act northern ireland <e> <s> the increase is per cent <e> <s> of the net annual value of the premises to which the certificate relates <e> <s> the figure is per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> and the minimum amount would be rising to a maximum of <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord and indeed i ask who would pay this particular sum <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will be aware that there was a lengthy debate on this subject at the end of last year initiated by my noble friend lord broxbourne <e> <s> there are major technical difficulties in having an effective bill of rights in only one part of the united kingdom and of course this would also oblige the judiciary to make what we should call political judgments <e> <s> that was the main reason why my right honourable and noble colleagues decided recently against a bill of rights for the united kingdom as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought i had indicated that we considered that we should treat this matter on a united kingdom basis <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord lord prys-davies gave us the whole quote from the communiqu after the intergovernmental conference meeting on th october <e> <s> no the governments view is not hardening but as the noble lord will know and as i hope i have indicated already there are many aspects of this particular matter to be considered <e> <s> as the noble lord will be aware many of them were considered in your lordships house during the debate last december <e>", "<cs> my lords i could not give that guarantee but i should say that the standing advisory commission on human rights began this extensive review in as no doubt the noble lord will be aware <e> <s> i think also he may take as an indication of our support the fact that the government have given of additional funding as well as additional staff <e> <s> so the government do take this work very seriously <e> <s> however i could not give a guarantee particularly on the time-scale such as the noble lord has sought <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state has indicated our strong support and i hope that might help the noble lord <e> <s> i am sure your lordships as well as the noble lord will be happy to know that the government support equal opportunities in northern ireland and a body of legislation exists to assist this particular aspect <e> <s> a consultative paper called <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords question is very interesting but i believe that it is a little wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i was coming to that matter <e> <s> i was snared by the legal procedures the legal personality the legal capacity and the tax exemptions <e> <s> if the noble lord has any further points on that perhaps i may write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indebted to the noble lord <e> <s> there will be an opportunity to present an annual report that will also go to donors to the fund <e> <s> i understand that there will be a professional audit and that this will be the responsibility of the board itself <e> <s> i hope that these remarks complete any answers to queries raised by noble lords <e> <s> if any points have been missed <e> <s> i shall write to noble lords <e> <s> i commend the order to your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to place this matter beyond doubt <e> <s> i have already stressed twice but will stress again that the board is independent <e> <s> i did however say that the government will have the right to offer advice <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will take that remark in the spirit in which i put it forward <e> <s> i do not believe that there will be heavy-handed advice or anything approaching the darker thoughts that may have been in the noble lords or anyone elses mind <e> <s> we would have the right this does not mean that either or both governments would in fact carry this out to offer advice through the advisory committee <e> <s> but again we would expect the detailed work to be evaluated by government departments <e> <s> that is usually the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i reiterate what i said earlier <e> <s> but there is no question of either government interfering with the decision of the board <e> <s> i hope that that reassures the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords no just the recreation and youth service northern ireland order <e> <s> i shall make brief reference to the next order <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall come to that <e> <s> it is the youth committee and the sports council <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will i am sure be grateful as i am for the close attention paid to the order by the two noble lords who have spoken lord graham of edmonton and lord hampton <e>", "<cs> my lords not tonight <e> <s> the dinner hour calls and we may discuss the point later <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will forgive me if we leave out the algebra this evening <e> <s> he asked about the budget and what figures we were thinking of <e> <s> i have a huge list of figures of what are called recurrent grants and capital grants <e> <s> since

matters of this level but on a fairly small scale <e> <s> i understand that there are no specific new projects yet lined up <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure your lordships will agree with me in being grateful for the close attention that has been paid to this order particularly by the noble lord lord donaldson and the noble lord lord prys-davies both of whom have spoken this evening <e> <s> i was not necessarily aware of the ebb and flow of my noble friends behind me since i was paying close attention to the reasoned arguments of noble lords who were speaking <e> <s> however i am particularly grateful that the noble lord lord donaldson pointed out that the number of my noble friends had doubled <e> <s> this must be some indication of increasing interest in the order before us this evening

bill which is currently before another place <e> <s> i have been put on notice that your lordships will wish to cover a wide range of issues perhaps even wider than those we have discussed this

agreement <e> <s> i think that we are in total agreement with the points that have been raised by him about the futility of sundry protests and gestures which are made and which are recognised by

to which my noble friend refers was the subject of a debate during which he made sundry comments about ministers putting their own portfolios at risk in such ventures <e> <s> in this venture there is no risk of that <e> <s> it is far too early to make any commitment to government support for the project since we have not received any proposals <e> <s> however i assure my noble friend that when

government and the company will require <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as payments are concerned in previous cases the payment and monitoring systems were divided into three parts <e> <s> first harland and wolff would provide weekly cash forecasts to the department of economic development <e> <s> secondly consultants for the department would check the work in progress and provide monthly reports <e>

is capable of building the vessel <e> <s> i am not aware whether or not the same facilities would be available to provide for repairs or whether existing facilities would need to be enlarged <e> <s>

said today could sour any atmosphere <e> <s> my right honourable friends door is open to mr tikkoo and to all entrepreneurs who might wish to come to <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly we should need to be in touch with the commission <e> <s> in a recent case to which the noble lord is no doubt referring the sixth directive was invoked when govan shipyards alleged that a french yard had exceeded the sixth directive in a bid to build a ferry for brittany ferries <e> <s> as the noble lord and your lordships will be aware the sixth directive provides that where there is competition for a contract the commission can at the request of any member state examine the bid <e> <s> in that particular case the united kingdom lodged a formal complaint and after examining the bid the commission ordered the french yard to pay back to the french government that amount of support which had breached the sixth directive <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite correct <e> <s> subsidies of this type are available for shipbuilding <e> <s> contract support is the correct label for any government expenditure on a project of this type <e> <s> i would not commit the government to subsidies for any other project in any other yard although we would look at what subsidy might be available were mr tikkoo to produce realistic figures for my right honourable friends consideration in respect of this

not too sure whose name is being spelt incorrectly <e> <s> mine is frequently spelt wrongly but i do not think that it is pronounced as my noble friend pronounced the name of the entrepreneur at least not so far as i know <e> <s> i do not think that we could be responsible for checking on subsidies from any other nation <e> <s> that would be for mr tikkoo and for harland and wolff <e> <s> however as i stressed to the noble lord lord bruce the sixth directive would bite <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the position will remain as i stated it <e> <s> if the project is found to be realistic

matter for the usual channels and i have no doubt for my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the answer i can give to my noble friend is the same that i gave to lord bruce-gardyne that if either of my noble friends wishes to ask the government any particular question there are many channels available for them so to do now later at night or indeed early in the morning <e>", "<cs> yes but briefly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry <e> <s> perhaps i was not paying my customary close attention to the noble earls speech <e> <s> however i think he expressed that point <e> <s> he mentioned something of that nature <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble earl will accept from me that the government are taking and have taken significant measures to tackle <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to thank all noble lords who have stayed to discuss this particularly important and possibly regrettable annual order that i have to introduce <e> <s> i understand that this is the fifth occasion on which i have carried out this task <e> <s> every year we have a very constructive discussion and if i may venture to say so this year the noble lord lord fitt has presented us with a

<e> <s> a little later in the day i may have a little more to say about his comments <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened very carefully to everything that was said by the noble lord <e> <s> if there are any points that i have not taken up i am sure that he will forgive me <e> <s> we shall write to him on them <e> <s> i note what he says about the end of devolved government <e> <s> i hope that he will see devolved government again very soon and be in fine health to celebrate that great event in the fitt traditional style <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly take a question from the noble lord lord hunt in the gap but i think the noble lord lord fitt is boiling and ready to speak <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes to ask a question i shall certainly take it <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i am very grateful to noble lords who have picked their way through this fascinating volume of estimates <e> <s> i am grateful too for the detail of the questions asked today <e> <s> as the perspicacious noble lord lord graham of edmonton was quite right to observe i shall not be able to answer nor would it be the wish of noble lords that i should answer every single point from the dispatch box today in the detail which is deserved <e> <s> i shall write in considerable detail to the noble lord lord graham on many of the points that he has raised <e> <s> but i shall try to answer quite a few of the points today <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall make sure that that point is covered in the reply relating to consumer credit which i shall make to the noble lord <e> <s> i hasten to add that there is no less pressure put on individuals in this country as regards the purchase of the things which the noble lord has mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords we were most grateful for the very positive comments of the noble lord lord bonham-carter on our proposals dealing with the promotion of equality of opportunity in northern ireland <e> <s> as he will know the white paper setting out our proposals for strengthening the law against religious discrimination in employment as well as promoting fair employment practices was published just over a month ago on th may <e> <s> it is being debated in another place today <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank those noble lords who have spoken on the order this evening <e> <s> their remarks clearly show that there is a great amount of detail and interest in the order before the house and that it is not only the equal opportunities commission which will be grateful for the questions that have been asked of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords the ultimate dream is still under negotiation between mr tikkoo and my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend and your lordships that proposals for the acquisition of the harland and wolff shipyard and the terms of any possible sale which may be negotiated will be carefully scrutinised to ensure the best use of public funds as well

of his noble friend last week is yes i take on board his comments <e> <s> indeed my right honourable friend has taken careful note of everything that was said last week <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i cannot <e> <s> i shall certainly write to the noble lord with the figures for the last years <e>", "<cs> my lords all those factors will be and are being taken into consideration in both sets of negotiations as regards the ultimate dream and the shipyard itself <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the noble lords last question i repeat that of course we are taking into account the importance of harland and wolff to northern ireland <e> <s> it is very much part of our thinking when we have these discussions as to the future of the yard <e> <s> as regards the subsidy perhaps the noble lord should compare like with like <e> <s> we do not believe that harland and wolff is out of line with other similar shipyards and similar contracts elsewhere in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord lord cledwyn will appreciate that that will be one of the many factors we shall be considering as regards the future of the shipyard <e> <s> we shall be considering financial political and every kind of factor <e> <s> however i think the terms of my noble friends question were on value for money <e> <s> i am sure that would be the main thrust of any discussions

continuing with a number of interested persons on the future of harland and wolff <e> <s> we may have some further news in the near future about that <e>", "<cs> my lords i have stressed that value for money is one of the main considerations but i said that there were many others <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord with his customary close attention to what i have said will note that <e> <s> if the noble lord does not believe it then i am sure that everything that i and the government have said over the years will be at variance with what he believes <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend will receive the same answer as he received about two years ago when we were dealing with another interesting entrepreneur <e> <s> the famed firm of lawyers messrs sue grabbit and run will soon be seen in your lordships house <e> <s> but should anything of this nature arise again perhaps if my noble friend wishes to allude to my fortunes or those of my honourable and right honourable friends we

carefully everything that has been said by the noble lord particularly his name for this project <e> <s> the project is still under discussion with mr tikkoo and if anything of a realistic nature can be agreed i am sure we shall have news in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i think there are other rules which apply as regards my own profession <e> <s> however if i have said anything in your lordships house or possibly outside which might cast aspersions upon the dignity of any profession then i of all people would not wish to cast any aspersions upon the noble lord or upon my profession

in two lines <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we have had a very thorough and detailed debate not just on the new clause and the schedule which i introduced but also the amendments which have been tabled by the noble lord lord stallard <e> <s> indeed he and many other noble lords have entered into a most lively discussion <e> <s> i trust therefore that i shall be able to answer most of the

the noble lord that i had received technical advice <e> <s> i also stressed in my concluding remarks that there was a certainty of one in million but that was taken from semen in a particularly ugly

noble friend the noble lord lord prys-davies for the care with which they have studied the order <e> <s> indeed we believe it is an important step in combating homelessness and i hope that what i said

grateful for his support for what the government are trying to do for everybody in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords this investment has not merely brought confidence to the people of northern

members of the committee <e> <s> i hope that nothing i said in reply to the remarks of the noble lord lord monson when proposing the amendment suggested that knee-capping was anything other than a disgusting and foul offence crippling people <e>", "<cs> this situation is rather like pandoras box <e> <s> we now come to the word organised <e> <s> we should not take up more of the committees time

members of the assembly <e>", "<cs> i do not want to go further on the word organisation <e> <s> the noble lord is tempting me to go further down that road <e>", "<cs> i must finish this point <e> <s> the noble lord is tempting me <e> <s> no doubt he will tempt me again but i must resist <e> <s> i suggest to him that even if the words physical violence were appended to the amendment that may present more difficulties as regards a court deciding whether violence was involved <e> <s> we could cover intimidation which was mentioned by the noble lord lord fitt <e> <s> but i shall take on board the point mentioned by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should not follow on the lines of a beauty competition and start in reverse order <e> <s> but nobody could have made a more eloquent contribution than my noble friend who after all has a great deal of knowledge of northern ireland a good bit more than i have <e> <s> i have listened with great interest to what he said as well as to what has been said by everybody else who has spoken <e>", "<cs> he may if he wishes but for the reasons that i have spelled out we do not believe that it is the correct course of action as regards this particular aspect for councillors who breach their declaration in the council chamber <e> <s> i spelled that out at second reading it has been spelled out by your lordships and i have spelled it out again today <e>", "<cs> my attention to the noble lords excellent remarks wandered slightly in that i did not appreciate that the person who had been at the council was another member of the royal ulster constabulary <e> <s> what i understood was that some person would go to the sergeant and say that there had been a breach <e> <s> no if a member of the royal ulster constabulary fitted the categories in clause then he would have the right to take action but it is not a matter for the criminal law it is a matter for civil law <e> <s> that is what is set out in the bill before us <e> <s> no criminal offence is involved <e>", "<cs> i take the points raised by the noble lord lord harris of greenwich <e> <s> even if the amendment to which he has spoken were accepted does he believe does anyone here believe <e> <s> that it would make the bill any more workable in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> we have listened carefully to everything that has been said by noble lords who live in northern ireland <e> <s> i have listened carefully to my noble friend lord colnbrook <e> <s> he did not dissent widely from my view that the amendment if accepted would not make the bill workable <e>

about witnesses compared to applicants under clause i think stands <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord lord harris of greenwich heard what i said <e> <s> i gave an undertaking that i would reflect

<e>", "<cs> for the fourth time <e> <s> i gave the undertaking and i have nothing more to add <e>", "<cs> for the fifth time no <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mishcon has set out his case with great clarity and as he promised with commendable brevity <e> <s> i admit that i was not aware of his question for written answer of april <e> <s> i was somewhat apprehensive that i might have replied but i did not recall that such a question had crossed my desk <e> <s> i was therefore delighted when the noble lord confirmed that that was a matter dealt with by my noble friend lord glenarthur <e>", "<cs>

severity of imprisonment for other criminals <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has asked me to try to clear up an inconsistency <e> <s> i shall attempt to do so <e> <s> however there may be one or two grey and foggy areas as a result of the review by my noble friend <e> <s> as the noble lord lord harris will know this review by my noble friend lord carlisle was limited to the remission and parole arrangements in england and wales <e> <s> as a scot i must take care but i understand that a similar review is still under way with regard to scotland <e> <s> that leaves us with northern ireland

for terrorist and scheduled offences <e> <s> i should make that clear now <e> <s> all the fairly lengthy remarks that i directed at the noble lord lord mishcon i am sure will be taken on board <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord prys-davies who as we have come to expect moved his amendment succinctly briefly and clearly <e> <s> in the course of the second reading debate the noble lord suggested that bluntness and simplicity were not necessarily virtues as far as the declaration was concerned <e> <s> as regards the disqualification period for a breach of the declaration against terrorism i would suggest that the bluntness and simplicity of the present clause are preferable to the degree of refinement which this amendment seeks to introduce <e> <s> in taking a fixed five-year disqualification as the appropriate period the bill is largely following the existing law on disqualification for council office both in northern ireland and in great britain <e>", "<cs> my

takes in northern ireland affairs and after his continual work earlier in the week we salute him for that interest <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking to amendment no <e> <s> as well will be convenient to

amendments <e> <s> perhaps i may spell out what the bill aims to tackle because some of the discussion on the two amendments with which we have been dealing this afternoon has ranged fairly wide as did discussion on amendments at earlier stages of the bill <e> <s> we should remind ourselves that even at this stage the bill aims to tackle the problems of expressions of support no more no less by councillors for proscribed organisations and terrorism <e> <s> all of that is a problem <e> <s> however i do not see that there is any evidence that there is a problem in northern ireland with councillors <e> <s> they are not the people to whom we should be addressing our thoughts and our remarks we should be addressing them solely to councillors who express support for intimidation generally <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all noble lords who have spoken on this matter for their good wishes and support for the intentions of this bill and for the close attention that they have given to the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not do what is normally done on television for one particular contest that takes place in november <e> <s> therefore i start by thanking the noble lord lord prys-davies for his comments on these regulations <e> <s> i also thank the noble lord forthe warning that his noble friend lord fitt i understand that is the case as the noble lord lord fitt is sitting behind him was liable to say a few words <e> <s> however i shall come to the comments of the noble lord lord fitt in a few moments <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the chief electoral officer is responsible for the expenditure by each candidate <e> <s> i do not have the full details of the statutory legislation

inquiries <e>", "<cs> my lords once again the house owes a huge debt of gratitude to the noble lord lord prys-davies who has led the nice inquiry i must not call it an inquisition that he always leads

order not simply the figures presented to the house that i find of <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend reminds me that this is a traditional week at a place which is only or kilometres west of where we are now seated and where there are notable arrivals from northern ireland as well as from the republic <e> <s> one of the more successful trainers whom i salute has had notable successes at that particular festival as i believe it is called <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a fascinating debate on what appeared on the face of it to be an order and regulations which as your lordships have said come up with monotony each year <e> <s> each time i have to announce the reasons for introducing the measures <e> <s> the noble lord lord fitt to whose remarks i shall return in a moment has raised a most interesting concept <e> <s> the noble lord may not be surprised if his remarks go further than merely your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i have spoken to this order <e> <s> i do not think your lordships would wish me to say any more on it <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord prys-davies for the attention which he has paid to the order before us this evening <e> <s> i am sure that he and your lordships will accept that i have been guided by the opinion of the joint committee on consolidation bills <e> <s> however i shall answer as far as i can the queries raised by the noble lord and if there are any further points i shall write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of the points raised in the noble lords first supplementary question but my right honourable friend sees no need at present for the establishment of any formal arrangements for the purpose described <e> <s> however i certainly hope that noble lords will accept that my right honourable friend the secretary of state would be willing to consider any proposals on this aspect of the anglo-irish agreement which might be put forward or any other proposals which command widespread support <e> <s> that is the important factor <e>", "<cs> my lords i am tempted to think that that is another question <e> <s> the reports in your lordships house may well be read elsewhere but i cannot say <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords point is somewhat covered by the matter that i stressed to the noble lord lord hylton <e> <s> my right honourable friend is open to suggestions as to whether any more information could be given on the lines advanced by the noble lord lord prys-davies <e> <s> the door to my right honourable friend is open but we see no need for any more formal discussion beyond the existing arrangements which seem to work reasonably for the conference as well as for the anglo-irish agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know to which parties the noble lord refers <e> <s> however perhaps i may stress again that my right honourable friend will consider proposals which command widespread support among the parties in northern ireland <e> <s> if proposals came forward which commanded widespread support among the constitutional parties in northern ireland i am sure that my right honourable friend would try to accede to the wishes of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the question on the order paper today i know that my right honourable friend receives a very large number of questions and comments <e> <s> however the noble lord is in a different position <e> <s> he is a member of your lordships house <e> <s> i am sure that any approach that he might make would receive due attention <e> <s> i assure the noble lord that a great deal of attention is paid by my right honourable friend to comments on the matters set down in the question and on many other matters that occur in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the two noble lords who have attended so patiently until i could move the order now before us <e> <s> the noble lord lord prys-davies has carefully scrutinised this order and has clearly carried out some research <e> <s> as far as i can understand he has received one or two comments about which i may have something to say in a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord prys-davies for the close scrutiny great care and attention that he has given to these two orders <e> <s> as your lordships will see by a cursory and preliminary examination they cover a very broad spectrum of the treatment of offenders and a particular aspect of northern ireland which sadly is very prevalent and very necessary <e> <s> the questions and points put by the noble lord lord prys-davies show that as always he has considered every aspect and we are grateful for his scrutiny and on this occasion his advice on these facets <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already spoken to this order on which the noble lord lord prys-davies raised several matters <e> <s> therefore i do not think that your lordships would wish me to make any further comments thereon <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank all noble lords who have spoken on this apparently innocuous order <e> <s> it comes to this house at least once a year and this is the sixth occasion on which i have had the honour to present it <e>", "<cs> my lords that is true but it is a somewhat slower process than might be thought when the noble lord says more and more <e> <s> if the number of schools i have mentioned were to double over the next two or three years that could be seen as progress but we have to take each step as it comes <e> <s> i certainly know that my honourable friend responsible for education has made this a high priority <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly write to the noble baroness <e> <s> i believe that the figure is in the region of per cent <e> <s> but it might be more <e> <s> my accountancy training does not assist me too much on the total population of schools in northern ireland in regard to primary infant secondary and up to sixth form colleges <e> <s> i shall certainly write to the noble baroness with a figure for the number of pupils and in percentage terms accurate to one decimal place <e> <s> as i said lagan college is the one well-known example for belfast <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not startled at the very interesting and close attention that the noble lord lord graham of edmonton paid to the detail and to what some kind friends may call

much <e> <s> nevertheless while i apologise to your lordships for perhaps going into too much detail i know the diligence with which noble lords go through these accounts <e>", "<cs> my lords the last few words of the noble lord encapsulate i believe the entire tenor of the debate that we have had this evening <e> <s> there have been one or two questions <e> <s> i would not say that they were criticisms <e> <s> i am pleased that my noble friend lord mottistone has returned <e> <s> i am not sure whether he won his competition on the water of the thames <e> <s> however i call it the return of the viking <e>", "<cs> my lords although such comment might or might not be fair i congratulate my noble friend <e> <s> i am sure that we are all delighted to see him in good health and competent as indeed we would expect a distinguished officer of the royal navy to be even on the waters of the thames <e> <s> however he won <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly take that but we have been considering for some time whether we could change or how we might change this procedure to meet some of the problems set out by the noble lord <e> <s> it was stressed by my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary of state in another place on th may that certainly we would be examining these administrative procedures closely to see whether we could revise them <e> <s> i am afraid that i have no news tonight but possibly at another stage i might have some more news <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to my noble friends first supplementary question he will be aware that prior to submitting formal notification to the european commission in cases such as this officials have informal discussions with officials from the european commission about how best to present the proposed package of financial assistance <e> <s> the discussions between the two sets of officials in this case were most helpful <e> <s> the notification that was submitted drew very heavily on the advice which we received <e>", "<cs> my lords it is indeed a great comfort to have such support from the noble lord <e> <s> i reiterate that after the formal notification to the european commission the commission has days in which to reply which according to my calculations takes us to th august <e> <s> your lordships will know that that is the maximum period and we have some hope of receiving news before august <e>", "<cs> in general yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i should say that if there is any confusion at the outset about the procedural arrangements for dealing with the bill the arrangements have been made through the usual channels <e> <s> i should perhaps preface my remarks by making a slight apology in that there is a commendable amount of speed but i hope not haste in dealing with each stage of the bill <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will accept that the matter has been agreed through the usual channels <e> <s> he will be aware that the tabling of many of the amendments both by the government and by his noble friends was dependent upon negotiations that have taken place between my honourable friend the minister and the noble lords honourable friend <e> <s> i hope that we have managed to fulfil most of our obligations in this particular respect ensuring that we put down the amendments as i indicated them at second reading <e>", "<cs> at the outset perhaps i may offer to the noble lord lord dunleath the latin words <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may try to do that right now <e> <s> if the noble lord will look at page of the bill he will see in clause <e>", "<cs> we are particularly grateful for the eloquence with which the noble lord lord prys-davies has put his case both today and at second reading <e> <s> this is not the first time that the suggestion has been made that my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor rather than the department of economic development for northern ireland should have the say in this matter <e>", "<cs> the noble lord will see that clause states without prejudice and it will enable the tribunal to sit in private <e> <s> that is the man thrust of subsection <e> <s> i hope that the committee will accept the fact that proceedings before the fair employment tribunal will normally take place in public <e> <s> however the provision in subsection gives sole discretion to the tribunal which i am sure the noble lord will accept contains experts in this area to decide whether it is appropriate for evidence from any person to be heard in private session <e> <s> we intend that the discretion will be exercised rarely <e> <s> that is clear from the constraints which clause places on the tribunals exercise of that option <e>", "<cs> the noble lord will be aware that subsection sets out the penalties which apply following a conviction for any of the offences set out in subsection <e> <s> a person found guilty on summary conviction of either offence is liable in the first instance to a fine <e> <s> that is the maximum fine provided by article of the fines and penalties northern ireland order <e>", "<cs> i

say to the noble lord lord blease that as regards an apology he will do what many of us in northern ireland do that is look at the good book <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will look at st john chapter verse which i use very frequently <e> <s> he can disregard the part about the woman taken in adultery but if he looks at the rest of that chapter he will find that it is particularly relevant to the noble lord lord mottistone and myself as i attended two such events last week <e>", "<cs> i look forward to a detailed and erudite discussion on clause <e> <s> i meant no discourtesy to the committee

operate <e> <s> the chairman of the tribunal will certainly be a legally qualified person <e> <s> the three groups of documents which i set out should be sufficient for the commission let alone the chairman of the tribunal to adduce an opinion <e> <s> i do not necessarily accept the point set out by the noble lord that there would be a delay <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> coupled with amendment no <e> <s> will strengthen the powers of the commission as well as the powers of discovery and so on of the tribunal <e> <s> that is why i believe that amendments nos <e> <s> and should be part of the bill <e>", "<cs> that is the main purpose of the bill <e> <s> in serious cases there should not be an instant reply <e>", "<cs> i am not aware that the regulations are in draft form but i shall certainly inquire about that <e> <s> the noble lord asked about indirect discrimination <e> <s> we should wait until we come to the relevant definition in the bill of indirect discrimination <e> <s>

the area of undertakings that we are discussing at this moment <e> <s> we should wait until we come to clause before we move deeply into indirect discrimination <e> <s> it is not germane to the delay to which the noble lord referred at an earlier stage <e>", "<cs> i should love to be sympathetic indeed i think that the noble lords lord bonham-carter and lord prys-davies will accept that we are now treading over familiar and very eloquent ground <e> <s> however the issue of the appropriate forum to hear appeals from employers against directions of the commission was discussed exhaustively in another place at considerable length <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> i hope i gave no indication that the high court let alone the judge would be divorced from reality <e> <s> the main tenet of my argument is that we believe that the tribunal already has the relative and relevant legal knowledge and we felt that the combinations of that legal knowledge and status together with the practical experience would be the proper and the best forum to take these particular actions and that it would be best to proceed in this way <e> <s> certainly i would never suggest that the judge would be divorced from reality <e> <s> it is just that we believe the tribunal is the best and most expeditious forum <e> <s> of course the appeal function can be carried out by the tribunal <e> <s> the bill also provides a role for the high court in the enforcement proceedings at a more appropriate stage if necessary <e>", "<cs> i wish to thank the noble lord lord monson for the way in which he presented the amendment

lords lord dunleath lord hylton and lord monson is to try to answer their questions <e> <s> most of the points that they are worried about should come out when i explain why we believe that we need to retain clause <e>", "<cs> i am fascinated to hear my noble friend say that he wants the clause tightened up <e> <s> his amendment seeks to eliminate it <e> <s> i find that curious <e> <s> i wonder where my noble friend feels that he is seeing what i can only regard as bogies in clause <e> <s> i do not see anything in the clause let alone in subsection which would give rise to what my noble friend believes <e> <s> i believe that clause stands or falls with clause <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord monson said i stressed that the scale of penalties in the earlier amendment was necessary <e> <s> the maximum scale i set out in the bill is relevant and needed as a deterrent <e> <s> some penalties may appear to be draconian but they are intended to catch repeated offenders and infractions <e>", "<cs> i shall take on board the points raised by the noble lord as i did at an earlier stage <e>", "<cs> members of the committee will not be totally surprised that i cannot agree with everything which has been said by the noble lord lord prys-davies this evening let alone on this amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord <e> <s> lord monson has moved amendment no <e> <s> in an excellent manner and very clearly <e> <s> i believe members of the committee will accept that we would have every sympathy with an employer who refused to offer employment to an applicant who had been convicted of an offence connected with terrorism in northern ireland was known to be an active member of a paramilitary organisation or was known actively to support terrorism in other ways <e> <s> i share that sympathy <e> <s> i am pleased to be able to tell the noble <e>", "<cs> i shall look first at paragraph a of the amendment that the noble lord is attempting to introduce <e> <s> there may well be job vacancies in northern ireland where experience of service in the security forces may be relevant <e> <s> if the nature of the job is such that it cannot be done satisfactorily without that experience in other words it is a requirement that is wholly justifiable for the job irrespective of the religious belief or political opinion of the applicant then the employer is already on safe ground <e>", "<cs> i shall take on board what the noble lord has said <e> <s> but even he would agree that the sum mentioned is certainly reasonable in such cases <e> <s> it is a fairly large sum <e> <s> it is not chipping away at anything <e> <s> however i shall consider what he has said <e>", "<cs> it is on occasions like this that i am delighted to say that i hesitate to intervene <e> <s> i have a small note here and it seems that the noble lord lord prys-davies was almost making the case of the government in his defence of some of the bills provisions <e> <s> it is perhaps an occasion for humour during our lengthy proceedings <e>", "<cs> just <e>", "<cs> again i hesitate to intervene in a lively debate between the noble lord lord prys-davies and the noble baroness lady seear <e> <s> i think that i just understood the second point raised by the noble baroness <e> <s> i may have some help for her if not in relation to this particular amendment but certainly in relation to my own amendment which follows this one <e>", "<cs> with the utmost politeness perhaps i may counsel patience to the noble lord <e> <s> i have only given one side the dark side of the argument and explained why i think that the amendment of the noble lord lord prys-davies does not meet the case i have not yet expounded our case <e> <s> i shall do so briefly and quickly in due course <e>", "<cs> it will be existing training either by government and possibly also by private sector employers <e> <s> that would be a matter for discussion <e> <s> i had probably better not give my noble friend detailed answers this evening <e> <s> so far as i am aware most of this training would be from the public sector but i am sure that there would be participation from the private sector <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord hylton has made a valid point <e> <s> i shall attempt to take on board the points that have been raised by the experts the noble baroness who is expert in sex discrimination and the noble lord lord bonham-carter who draws attention to some aspects of race discrimination <e> <s> i wish them to remember that we are talking about northern ireland where there is a third and more insidious form of discrimination <e> <s> there is much to be learned which is being learned as a result of both sex and race discrimination measures in great britain <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord lord monson will accept that the effect of his amendment would be to compromise the main political objective behind affirmative action in northern ireland <e> <s> that objective is to encourage a more proportionate distribution of jobs and employment opportunities between the two main communal religious or political groupings in the province <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble lord lord blease for his opening compliments <e> <s> he should know that my duties in northern ireland take me around the province <e> <s> i assure him that the night is young <e> <s> if the noble lord has attended any agricultural dinners as i have he will know that the minister never speaks before one oclock in the <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord prys-davies raised this point at an earlier stage <e> <s> during the second reading debate i explained that we believe that the issue of a certificate under section of the fair employment northern ireland act is an inseparable part of the national security safeguard which that section provides and which all noble lords especially the noble viscount will agree is absolutely necessary <e> <s> to permit wider scrutiny of the reasons for the issue of such certificates would be to jeopardise the sensitive information on the strength of which such certificates are issued and in so doing to do potential harm not only to the efforts of the security forces in northern ireland to gather valuable intelligence about terrorist organisations but quite possibly to the safety of individual people <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for the reply given by the noble lord <e> <s> as we speak tonight and knowing as i putatively put it the scheduled commencement of the report stage of the bill in this chamber i think that it is extremely doubtful that we shall have an amendment by that time <e> <s> however i shall make a careful note of what the noble lord said and will be in touch with him before the next stage i hope as early as tomorrow <e> <s> but i really cannot give the guarantee he requested at this time <e> <s> i hope that i shall have further news before the completion of the consideration of the bill in this chamber but certainly not by the next stage of the proceedings on the bill <e>", "<cs> i shall reply to the very delicate way in which the noble lords lord bonham-carter and lord prys-davies placed their amendment in competition to mine <e> <s> i think both of them would accept that in my opening remarks i pointed out that the act already makes direct religious discrimination illegal <e> <s> we have ensured that that is covered in our amendment <e> <s> i hope that will also cover the query that was raised by the noble lord lord bonham-carter <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add my tribute to the solicitors and all who work for them <e> <s> we recognise all the good work that they do in very difficult conditions as indicated by the noble lord lord prys-davies <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the two noble lords on their stamina <e> <s> they have sat throughout the heat of debate <e>", "<cs> my lords it falls to me to reply to the opening comments of all noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> i understood that the arrangements for the bill we are discussing and which have aroused fairly strong emotions in your lordships house had been arranged through the usual channels <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord lord prys-davies will accept that when i was in his position i rose exactly years ago to make a powerful intervention <e> <s> i was told that the arrangements had been made through the usual channels <e> <s> i had a fairly lively conversation with my own chief whip <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lords who have spoken on this amendment with reason and good sense <e> <s> but there are one or two elements which have just been touched on by my noble friend lord mottistone which are not central to the arguments put forward by the noble lords lord bonham-carter and lord prys-davies <e>", "<cs> my lords very briefly with the leave of the house i think that the noble lord lord blease will have heard his noble friend mention that <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i suspect it will be for the last time perhaps i may briefly reply <e> <s> my noble friend on my right who is the leader of your lordships house is at the moment making kind noises but i would not wish to push his tolerance let alone that of your lordships much further <e> <s> i mentioned the second part of my comments <e> <s> i am sure that the noble baroness heard the noble lord lord prys-davies make one or two points on comments that he had heard about the effectiveness of the department of economic development <e> <s> otherwise i should not have taken up your lordships time n making that point <e> <s> i listened very carefully to the remarks made by the noble baronesss noble friend <e> <s> however i have to say that important though the points raised by the noble baroness are i am afraid that it is the constitutional argument that precludes acceptances of this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i saw a sign of assent from the noble lord lord bonham-carter <e> <s> i commend the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the comments of my noble friend and am interested in the points raised by the noble lords lord prys-davies and lord bonham-carter <e> <s> they will be aware that the amendment repeats several other amendments which were moved in another place <e> <s> we did not find it possible to accept them then and i am afraid that i do not see that we can change our position this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful and understand the sensitivities and concerns that have prompted my noble friend to table this amendment <e> <s> all noble lords who work in northern ireland will know that sectarian harassment and intimidation can take most unpleasant forms within some workforces there <e> <s> we all recognise that depressing reality <e> <s> however thanks to the courageous attitude displayed by many employers trade unionists and individuals for the largest part there are positive indications that traditional forms of harassment and intimidation are being progressively eradicated from the workplaces of northern ireland <e> <s> the governments <e>", "<cs> my lords we have certainly appreciated the pungent and excellent remarks of the noble lord lord bonham-carter together with the accurate attack of the noble lord lord prys-davies in moving this amendment <e> <s> of course they are quite right that discretion and confidentiality are at issue in this area <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord took me back a number of years to when he used this excellent word pleonastic <e> <s> i believe that it was used in connection with foreign language teaching and he used it validly this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may briefly express to the noble baroness the hope that i had not said necessarily that applications had to be in writing <e> <s> i believe the noble baroness will accept that it is extremely difficult <e> <s> i mentioned that there are almost insuperable and serious problems for employers for example as a result of applications by members of job clubs who are encouraged to make calls every day to various employers <e> <s> that is putting a heavy load on employers to do as i suggested <e> <s> a voice on a telephone is very difficult to identify even for someone like myself who is studying the provenance of persons in northern ireland in order to discover where they come from let alone identify their community affiliation or application <e>", "<cs> my lords i stressed that the monitoring regulations will make it clear what an employer is to do to ensure that as many as possible of those seeking employment with him are monitored <e> <s> the code of practice will give plenty of advice on recruitment practices including encouraging casual practices and encouraging employers to suggest to casual applicants that they should either apply in writing or that they await notification of vacancies in the future <e> <s> the code will clarify the definition but will not change it <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the point which has been raised by the noble lord <e> <s> he raised it with eloquence and with considerable passion <e> <s> of course i appreciate the noble lords wish that we should try to see that northern ireland is recognised as consisting of a single community <e> <s> however at all times we must look to what is defined in clause <e> <s> it is in part ii of the legislation that we are <e>", "<cs> my lords the words <e>", "<cs> my lords if all noble lords have finished speaking i am delighted to hear the words of the noble lord lord bonham-carter <e> <s> i shall have one or two words to say about his remarks later but if he believes that everybody will get the answers right the first time and every time we shall be most interested <e> <s> i see that the noble lord wishes to intervene but i shall come to his point later when i make special reference to it <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment standing in the names of the noble lords lord bonham-carter and lord prys-davies would add significantly as has been said in another place to the burdens laid on business without any corresponding benefit we believe for the commission <e> <s> in addition it is likely to make the registration and monitoring provisions very impracticable <e> <s> it would mean that in connection with his registration and monitoring responsibilities an employer would have to count all persons employed in his concern <e> <s> that at least in the short term would be unreasonable because he would have to include all those working part-time whoever they might be and all casual workers who might be working for him for very short periods <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to what the noble lord lord prys-davies had to say about his amendment <e> <s> i think he will agree that it concerns one of the tests which must be satisfied by a person who complains of indirect discrimination <e> <s> as such it could have far-reaching implications for the entire bill <e> <s> as the noble lord pointed out we covered the same ground in our deliberations in committee <e> <s> i fear that i may have to go over it once more <e> <s> this time i hope to be more concise <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment was superbly and eloquently argued by the noble lord <e> <s> however i am still a trifle puzzled because it seems to be attempting to strengthen the role of the tribunal in regard to recommending action in individual cases <e> <s> it also makes a confusing reference to an enforcement mechanism that provided by subsection which applies only to recommendations made under another subsection and which is not applicable in the circumstances set out by the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the rush i mean no discourtesy <e> <s> nevertheless the amendment makes a reference and i hope that with patience the noble lord will bear with me while i try to explain our case <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment that has been moved by the noble lord lord prys-davies ably supported by the noble lord lord bonham-carter takes us once again into very familiar territory <e> <s> i was not necessarily thinking of west belfast this early in the evening <e> <s> we are dealing with affirmative action training and protection from both direct and indirect discrimination <e> <s> when we come to our own alternative amendment no <e> <s> i shall have something more to say given that there is that possibility <e> <s> i ask your lordships to glance at the contents of what is now clause <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house and at this late hour i am afraid that i do not have much to add to what i have already said <e> <s> i am not entirely on all fours with what the noble baroness is driving at but perhaps i may consider carefully what she said and if she wishes we may take further action at a later stage of the bills proceedings <e> <s> i think that that is all i can do in the circumstances <e> <s> i cannot give a helpful or indeed a meaningful answer this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may reply <e> <s> i have listened to what the noble baroness has had to say and i shall certainly come to the point of the noble lords lord prys-davies and lord bonham-carter <e> <s> we are most grateful for the contribution from the noble baroness <e> <s> she has discerned the scope and intent as well as the effect of the amendment <e> <s> i shall have one or two more amplifications to add to the process of redundancy <e>", "<cs> my lords the last in first out method is one of several methods <e> <s> as i said if by an agreed procedure a large number of catholics was the result i think that in the three conditions which i stressed that would certainly be part of the agreed procedures <e> <s> i do not believe there is any need for a specific reference to last in first out schemes <e> <s> although they may be in the majority other schemes may exist also <e> <s> they are covered by the amendment to the extent that in appropriate circumstances we should want to see such schemes abandoned <e> <s> that would be precisely the case when a last in first out scheme would have the effect of eroding gains made by the under-represented community <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that last in first out was one of a number of schemes <e> <s> i do not necessarily take the thrust of the noble lords point <e> <s> however we are coming close to abusing the rules on report <e> <s> i have stressed all the conditions and the agreed procedures and i think that last in first out where it is covered by the agreed procedures should not represent a problem <e> <s> i covered the other problems which may be in the mind of the noble lord lord prys-davies <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment raises an issue that we have been through at considerable length both here and in another place as to what is a proper definition of affirmative action <e> <s> the term can be given different definitions in different jurisdictions <e> <s> the noble lord has suggested the meaning of affirmative action <e> <s> there is a definition in paragraph of our white paper i am thankful to learn that the noble lord has looked at it and one wonders why it does not appear in clause <e> <s> however we do not think that this amendment is necessary or indeed that it would meet the spirit of paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords lord prys-davies and lord bonham-carter went over this ground at an earlier stage <e> <s> it was raised even at second reading <e> <s> i acknowledge that both noble lords this evening have produced one or two new interesting sides to the argument <e> <s> i do not wish to repeat all the arguments that i deployed at an earlier stage let alone at second reading <e> <s> perhaps i may make two points in defence of our position <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i presented this amendment in indecent haste <e> <s> the noble lord has had a full innings and i shall reply briefly <e> <s> under clause your lordships will see that the president of the industrial tribunal and the fair employment tribunal is empowered to direct that any matters relating to unfair dismissal or sex discrimination raised in a case of religious discrimination before the fair employment tribunal may be heard by that tribunal <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord prys-davies will forgive me and i am sure that your lordships will be happy if i reiterate briefly how we see clause <e> <s> we have constructed this clause very carefully and with great sensitivity because of the way in which and i explained this at an earlier stage we are dealing with redundancy <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i stress that we want flexibility <e> <s> i did not raise the question of last in first out <e> <s> it was the noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords this ground has already been covered at various stages of the bill <e> <s> the speeches of noble lords have had a common strand of great sincerity and commitment and if i may so so to the noble lord lord bonham-carter no little eloquence <e> <s> in his opening remarks i hope that i paraphrase what he said correctly the noble lord said that no one was trying to dismantle the certificates <e> <s> there has been no dissension in relation to the other common theme which runs through this subject namely security <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may finish <e> <s> we are in danger of getting out of order <e> <s> if the noble lord raises another point we shall be out of order <e> <s> i shall conclude my remarks in a moment so perhaps he can contain his patience until then <e> <s> i have listened to his views on the matter and perhaps he will now <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords will have grasped that we are dealing with a special situation when a case of sex discrimination is under way before an industrial tribunal and a complaint of religious discrimination is or can be made in addition to the complaint under the sex discrimination order <e> <s> under the bill as drafted there would be an opportunity for the president of the fair employment tribunal to consider whether or not to give such a direction that the sex discrimination proceedings should be heard by the fair employment tribunal <e> <s> the amendment would leave the president no reasonable opportunity to consider the giving of a direction <e> <s> the amendment would have the effect that proceedings before the industrial tribunal would continue and could reach a conclusion before the president gave a direction <e> <s> that would nullify the existing provision in schedule which is there for the precise purpose of permitting the president to draw breath as it were <e> <s> it would be quite unworkable to require the president to take his decision while an industrial tribunal continues its deliberations <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e> <s> at this stage it is my happy and pleasant duty to sum up what we have discussed and considered during our deliberations on all stages of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i may be permitted to reply very briefly to all the nice things that have been said about my colleagues about myself and about the bill <e> <s> perhaps i may return some of the compliments to noble lords who have spoken in the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords while leaving the wild oats to my noble friend can she say whet her farmers can obtain advice on other aspects of set aside such as those to do with the environment <e>", "<cs> my lords the first thing i want to do this afternoon is to congratulate my noble friend the minister of state for the clear way in which she has introduced this particularly important bill <e> <s> i want to pass on my personal congratulations to the ministry as well as to all departments <e> <s> i am particularly pleased that my noble friend lady hooper will be taking part today and at all stages of the bill <e>", "<cs> not entirely my lords <e> <s> i said to your lordships that i do not have any major scientific qualifications <e> <s> i shall look forward to taking a lesson <e> <s> if i have caused any confusion i apologise <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that your lordships will allow me to take a few moments to reiterate many of the points which have been made <e> <s> my thoughts on integrated education were beautifully expressed by the noble lord lord dunleath <e> <s> indeed as he pointed out as long ago as he and his colleagues set up the framework for much of this particular stratum of legislation in the order this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just say to my noble friend that i am no stranger to the orthopaedic ward <e> <s> all four limbs have been repaired during my career in your lordships skiing team <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down can she assist me on a point raised by my noble friend lord radnor who referred to clause dealing with emergency control orders <e> <s> i confess to my noble friend as well as the committee that it escaped my notice that these emergency control orders can be made particularly in scotland by a sheriff <e> <s> am i right in thinking that once an emergency control order had been made it would have to be debated as any other order in this chamber <e>", "<cs> can the noble viscount please enlighten me and many other members of the committee <e> <s> how does he reconcile what he said in support of his amendment about i think he called it slurry that is the bones and i presume the interior of bones which would include marrow and other such products with meat <e> <s> he and i and perhaps all other consumers in your lordships house would understand that <e> <s> i quite understand meat products since many of the items that might have been mentioned by the noble viscount for instance bones crushed products and the attractively named slurry might go into such forms of meat products as pate and other substances <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend accept our gratitude for giving us the statement about which we have been hearing a great deal <e> <s> some of us look forward to reading the report from cover to cover as we were advised by our right honourable friend the prime minister <e> <s> we might learn from it if we do so <e> <s> let us not forget that human beings died at the match

firm clear conclusions that they have set out in the report that we are debating briefly this evening <e> <s> most of the points scientific and esoteric for and against this process of irradiation
