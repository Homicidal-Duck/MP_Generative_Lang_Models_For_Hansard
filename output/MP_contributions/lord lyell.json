["<cs> my lords perhaps it would be in order for me to reply fairly swiftly to the first point raised by the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey <e> <s> i had not covered amendments nos <e> <s> and in my remarksi thought that probably i had wearied your lordships long enough on the first two amendments which were in the style of paving amendments as the noble and learned lord rightly pointed out <e> <s> he went on to refer to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> the first comment the noble and learned lord made was about the linchpin of our amendment being designation of an event <e> <s> we see the merit of what he said in that so far as i am aware guidelines are already available not necessarily for the transport authorities but there are thoughts already as to which events should be designated events and i hasten to reassure the noble and learned lord about the events to which he was referring when he was last with us either in committee or on second reading when he spoke of murrayfieldthat is not yet scheduled to be a designated event but we see that there is merit in what he said and we shall certainly look at that point <e>", "<cs> with leave my lords i think that we have <e> <s> i have spoken to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say to my noble friend lord teviot that i will come to his pointi have not forgotten him <e> <s> may i start with amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> the house will be <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not sat down <e> <s> if the noble lord has a point to raise he will i am sure remember that all of us myself included are allowed to speak just once <e> <s> i understand that i am allowed to speak with the leave of the house <e> <s> the house has been hearing me for quite a whilebut if the noble lord has a point will he raise it <e> <s> i was going on to the point raised by my noble friend lord teviot <e>", "<cs> my lords the only advice i have from the qualified experts is that the driver would be expected to do what he normally would do what is reasonable as a driver <e> <s> i do not know whether there are crowds of alcoholic persons going around to other functions or that dare i say it <e> <s> womens rural outings devolve into incredible orgies <e> <s> i do not think so <e> <s> but i should think the driver has some experience of driving <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that that is the case <e> <s> i am given to understand that it is not the interpretation of this clause that the driver would have to prove his innocence <e> <s> i do not know how many steps a driver might have to take which would be regarded as reason <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house it seems rather like the curates egg yes and no in various parts <e> <s> the noble lord is right in saying that the driver should continue if he discovers that alcohol is on board the coach if it is a reasonable thing to do and if the driver could take steps to have the alcohol put off the coach then no he is not allowed to continue <e>", "<cs> my lords the house has heard quite enough from me on these two amendments <e> <s> however i would say to the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey that it is entirely my responsiblity to try to interpret these clauses and to try to be as familiar as i can be with scottish law <e> <s> i do not know about other noble lords but i have some knowledge of it <e> <s> i am sorry if i used the word defender <e> <s> i stuck fairly carefully to my instructions and that i am sure is what i said <e> <s> i have nothing to add to what i said before <e> <s> i explained the case then very fully and i will allow it to rest there <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble and learned lord for his generous welcome for what we have tried to achieve with the amendment <e> <s> we shall look at it again <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to reply very swiftly and briefly to my noble friend lord inglewood <e> <s> at the outset i should like to say that the british transport police whom he has described when dealing with any offences which relate to or which are committed on railway property enjoy exactly the same powers as the regular police under the existing law <e> <s> as my noble friend said they are the county policebut i think that they would be a regional police force in scotland <e> <s> therefore we can see no necessity for a special provision such as that which is contained in this amendment in order to enable the transport police to deal with any new offences which we have not yet lined up at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i cannot <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an operational matter for the post office management <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware that among the technological inventions of the post office there was <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall inform my noble friend who might fall under the title so aptly put by the noble viscount <e> <s> that is the best that i can do <e> <s> as i said before this is a matter for post office management and not for any other form of management <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord give way <e> <s> i think it is the feeling of the house that the noble lord might be abusing the custom <e> <s> he may ask probably one question but i think it would be the feeling of the house that the noble lord might pursue this argument either by writing to my noble friend or possibly at a later date <e> <s> the noble lord made a lengthy and worthwhile speech <e> <s> it might be the feeling of the house that my noble friend has replied to all the points <e> <s> i think that the noble earl <e>"]
