["<cs> my lords making a maiden speech before any assembly is a somewhat daunting experience <e> <s> however i have already noticed that your lordships invariably extend to all speakers a kindness and a courtesy not invariably found in the place from whence i come <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome that encouraging answer from my noble friend <e> <s> will he agree that as this is national housing week it is appropriate that we should pay tribute to the outstanding work done by local housing authorities <e> <s> may i say how glad i am that he has confirmed that local housing authorities will still have an important role to play in an activity that i hope will be extended to the handicapped and mentally disabled who also need sheltered accommodation <e>", "<cs> my lords i became accustomed in another place to the high quality of select committee reports from your lordships house <e> <s> but i have known none which is more worthy of attention and indeed action than the one we are discussing today <e> <s> the governments white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that without it there could be virtually no worthwhile programme <e> <s> i think that he would grasp at anything <e> <s> i only say that that is the minimum <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i said that i hoped that the government had ears as well as guts <e>", "<cs> my lords i am astonished by that answer <e> <s> i cannot understand why the government should accept the logic of the amendment and yet illogically oppose it <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that the noble earl lord russell is rather easily shocked <e> <s> i do not know why he should be surprised at going to a cricket match these days <e> <s> he could see someone throwing something whether it is verbal abuse or a ball probably at the umpire <e> <s> i have a feeling that in this regard the government are in the position of the umpire who at the time of the appeal cannot be popular both with the batsman and the bowler <e> <s> i cannot conceive of any circumstances in which a measure involving the restructuring of local government finance could be received with wild enthusiasm <e> <s> it will only be really popular among those who pay less <e> <s> that is the test of fairness <e> <s> the government must be sure that more people pay less and then it may be all right <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no idea nor i suspect has the noble lord <e> <s> we do know that reform of the rating system has been the subject of discussion and dissension for more years than he or i can remember <e> <s> it perhaps goes back to the report of the royal commission on the poor law in <e> <s> it found that the poor law was raising shillings per head of the population and said that the nation looked on <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to be associated with the tribute paid by the noble lord lord bruce of donington to sir brandon rhys williams and with his expressions of sympathy to sir brandons family on this sad day <e> <s> he was a friend and colleague of mine for many years both in another place and in the european parliament <e> <s> in both places he played a notable part particularly in promoting social and economic ideas <e>", "<cs> i did not feel that i could support the first amendment not only on constitutional grounds but because i believed like others of my noble friends that it was not merely nonsense but nonsense on stilts <e> <s> however this is a much more serious amendment and one which i believe it is right that the committee should consider as an alternative <e> <s> my own view is that it is not an alternative which is practicable at the moment <e> <s> as i said at second reading i have a fear that the community charge whatever arrangements are made about rebates or exemptions will not in the long run provide a sufficient base for local government expenditure to be independent <e> <s> it will raise only a quarter of the money required <e>", "<cs> i have certainly not been uncritical of previous legislation on local government introduced by conservative governments <e> <s> i opposed the act which i said was unworkable and disastrous and so it has proved <e> <s> that is why we need to have this bill with all its imperfections <e> <s> i did not say i thought that the government had been arrogant and high-handed <e> <s> i only said that the prime minister herself has emphasised how important it is that they should not be <e> <s> therefore although i know well that local authority associations do not feel that all consultations have been as good as they ought to <e>", "<cs> there is one point which seems relevant in relation to any attempt to define what is a religious community of which people approve and one of which they do not <e> <s> it would be helpful if the minister indicated that the government have no intention of trying to redefine what is a religion or a charity as regards this schedule <e>", "<cs> i share to a considerable extent the concerns expressed by the noble lord lord graham of edmonton in relation to this matter <e> <s> i believe that the government have been courageous imaginative and to a large extent have shown immense ingenuity in bringing forward the bill <e> <s> but as i said on second reading i think there remains real anxiety about the way in which the proposals in the bill will in effect turn non-domestic rates into a national tax with the revenue assigned to local government on a per-adult basis in perhaps a rather arbitrary way <e>", "<cs> my noble friend referred to me <e> <s> perhaps i may say that i do not wholly recognise his comment on my observations <e> <s> i do not in any way doubt the good intentions of the government or the general merit of what he said <e> <s> however i should like some assurance for which i ask definitely that the cbi the local authority associations and others will continue to be consulted about what will go into the regulations <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will give consideration to this question of the rating of empty properties either now or at some subsequent stage <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mcintosh said there is a history of discussion about the rating of empty properties <e> <s> i hope that it will never happen to my noble friend the minister that he will follow what increasingly has become a practice namely that of former ministers getting up subsequently and declaring i am afraid i got it all wrong <e>", "<cs> i intervene only very briefly because like other noble lords i have been concerned with these matters over a good many years <e> <s> i will not repeat the arguments of my noble friends with which i fully agree <e> <s> i should like also to emphasise that this does not concern just either westminster or birmingham <e> <s> for example it is a matter of concern to newcastle and it is a matter of concern to all cities which are at the present time giving support to the arts <e> <s> that is a matter to which we shall come again later on <e>", "<cs> i agree that i do not know what combination of amendments would be appropriate <e> <s> the value of this debate is that it has raised the anxieties and i am sure it will help my noble friend the minister in his discussions with the secretary of state and others if he is able to show which i do not think he will have much difficulty in doing the mood of this committee <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter pointed out this discussion has raised two points <e> <s> the first was the rather limited one about the matter of the timing <e> <s> as regards that point i am sure that my noble friend the minister will have regard to what has been said <e> <s> on the second point should not like the impression to be given that everyone on this side of the committee is enthusiastic about the concept of rate capping or wholly convinced of its necessity particularly as my noble friend has pointed out that one of the arguments in favour of this bill is that it would make rate capping less necessary in the future than in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe it will be readily agreed that this statement does not lend itself to off-the-cuff comment <e> <s> however i should like to ask the minister whether he could follow up the point made by the noble lord lord mcintosh about the period of consultation <e> <s> can he say how long this will be and with whom it will be <e> <s> will it be sufficient to avoid our recent experience of retrospective legislation to amend retrospective legislation which will involve more retrospective legislation <e> <s> i should like him to say a little bit more about consultation <e>", "<cs> my lords in the course of our debates i have indicated that i greatly admire the courage and the imagination sometimes the ingenuity with which the government have introduced this measure <e> <s> i should like to pay tribute to my noble friend lord caithness for the way in which he has skilfully and courteously piloted the measure through the house <e> <s> as a new member i am enormously impressed by the way in which in your lordships house it is possible to disagree without being disagreeable <e> <s> i also welcome the many concessions which have been made by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend the minister agree that increasing interest rates does not necessarily control inflation but may in fact fuel it apart from other side-effects <e> <s> in so far as the noble lord lord ezra suggests that there is a rise in consumer expenditure which is in some ways dangerous would it not be a good idea for the government to do something to stop the banks and others issuing credit cards and excessive borrowing at rates of interest which would make a mafia loan shark look like a charitable institution and which incidentally would have landed the mafia loan shark in prison for a very long time <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is a little unwise to refer to it just as a document <e> <s> it was an agreement in the nature of a treaty <e> <s> apart from the single european act it is the only one that has been brought before the community in all its years <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may put something to him <e> <s> i should like to assure him that i am certain there are many noble lords on this side of the house who having listened to what he has said will accept that the good faith of the government is clearly in question and that a question has been raised as to the integrity of public administration <e>", "<cs> my lords to use the noble lords phrase the feeling is not one of disappointment but of outrage <e> <s> a very clear specific and so far unchallenged attack has been made upon the good faith of the government by the noble lord lord callaghan speaking with all the authority and dignity of a former prime minister <e> <s> if i may say so he has put his case very fairly <e> <s> i believe that the government must answer it properly <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the commitment in the gracious speech to the european community and to the completion of the single market especially because it is allied to an undertaking to play a full part in multilateral negotiations to liberalise trade and agriculture <e> <s> we have passed the single european act and i have no doubt that we intend to implement it <e> <s> i only hope that in due course we can say the same about our european partners <e>", "<cs> my lords we are rightly grateful to the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs for having raised an important topic which has social and economic consequences <e> <s> on th july this year my noble friend lord beaverbrook rejected out of hand my plea that the government should take some action to control the credit boom as part of the battle against inflation <e> <s> i hope that tonight we shall see that the government are more aware of the dangers <e> <s> high interest rates cannot be the only weapon in the governments armoury <e> <s> indeed it can be said that at least in the short term and until they bring about <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not quite understand the reference to putting interest rates in the retail prices index <e> <s> whether or not they are put in the retail prices index people who have their mortgage rate increased will ask for more money <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt my noble friend yet again <e> <s> however will he give attention to the almost criminal rates of interest which are being charged in many cases <e> <s> are the government prepared to control what is virtually criminal behaviour or does he wish to deregulate crime as well as everything else <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend bear in mind that i dealt with my noble friends question in another place nearly years ago and the position has not changed since then <e> <s> indeed none of this matters very much because they have not laid an egg since the time of charles ii <e>", "<cs> my lords while i warmly welcome much of the statement <e> <s> perhaps i may press my noble friend on one point <e> <s> why do the government persistently regard democratically elected councillors as unrepresentative of local interests and concerns <e>", "<cs> my lords on that analogy why do we not leave government to the permanent secretaries <e>", "<cs> i appreciate what the secretary of state has said <e> <s> however i believe it ought to be placed on record although this may not be the moment to debate it that many people are deeply anxious about the way in which primary legislation often in skeletal form includes these clauses providing that the minister may amend or even at times repeal not only the primary legislation by order but sometimes other acts or even private <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like warmly to support everything that the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale has said <e> <s> this is a matter that has concerned me and which i have raised before <e> <s> everything that he said is of supreme importance not only in relation to this bill but in the way that we are handling all our legislation at the present time <e> <s> i was not present when the debate took place on clause but i read what the noble and learned lord lord simon said in his very erudite speech <e> <s> i cannot match such erudition but i share his feeling about provisions of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps that ought to be the practice with some of them if i may respectfully suggest it <e>", "<cs> i do not feel that the minister has met the serious point of principle that has been raised <e> <s> i have no doubt that there are practical difficulties there always are <e> <s> there are practical difficulties in the football spectators bill <e> <s> sometimes the government wish to remove or ignore practical difficulties at other times they wish to rely on them <e> <s> here i believe that the government are seeking to rely on them <e> <s> as i understand it my noble friend the minister indicated that he was not averse to the principle <e> <s> if he agrees with the principle then he should find some way of putting it into practice <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may join in the chorus of support in favour of the observations made by my noble friends lord peyton and lord mottistone <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister can tell the committee if he has read the discussion which took place on a rather similar issue during a debate on the children bill <e> <s> further can he say whether he has studied what was said by the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale and the response given by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> does he agree that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor is right in what he said on that bill as regards amendment by regulation <e> <s> if there is to be amendment by regulation i agree that one should put it in the primary legislation when it is what the government really intend to do if that is possible <e> <s> if it is to be done by regulation will he agree as in the case of the children bill that it should be done by affirmative resolution <e> <s> i understand that where there is negative resolution only it is not the practice of this place to divide <e> <s> however in the debate on the children bill the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor appeared to indicate that that practice may be changed but stated that it would not be very satisfactory because of the pressure on parliamentary time and such matters <e> <s> therefore i hope that the minister will at the very least agree to accept the amendment put forward by my noble friend lord mottistone <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly comment on what my noble friend the minister had to say about the discussion which took place on the children bill <e> <s> it arose originally out of a power to repeal by regulation <e> <s> i think he will accept that the debate went far wider than that <e> <s> it was pointed out that amend can mean something very close to repeal <e> <s> it is not an excuse for leaving out of primary legislation what clearly ought to be in <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware of the great anxiety felt in universities at present about the situation which has been deteriorating for some considerable period <e> <s> when was the letter received from the committee of vice-chancellors and principals <e> <s> will he give the house an assurance that he will tell his right honourable friend that a reply should be sent quickly and that it cannot be said that it is a matter for the universities <e>", "<cs> i should like to add something to what has already been said <e> <s> i entirely support what my noble friend lord jenkin of roding has said in moving this amendment <e> <s> like other noble lords who have spoken in this debate i must declare an interest as chairman of britannia arrow holdings and chairman and director of a number of other companies involved in financial services and banking <e>", "<cs> i gather that the government are moving away from this position and have this point in mind <e> <s> what has happened is that equivalence has tended to be translated as identical <e> <s> against that background mr walker said that he would like an attempt made to reach a common code of principles for all the rule books <e> <s> that may seem a step forward and it would help to achieve a level playing field for those who now have to consult a number of rule books <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to discuss the thirteenth directive which i understand is still being debated and on which the government still have to express a clear view <e> <s> as i understand the amendment i believe it reflects a growing anxiety in the public mind about the nature the conduct and the extent of takeovers and mergers in recent years <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to hear that <e> <s> i hope that it will not take as long as the department of trade and industry to publish the results of its conclusions <e> <s> but the very fact that there is <e>", "<cs> i very much hoped that that would be the case <e> <s> no doubt my hopes will be fully realised <e> <s> i am not making any criticism of the secretary of state <e> <s> i am saying that i hope that the takeover panel will produce those results soon <e> <s> the very fact that it has a working party shows that it has at any rate an appreciation of the publics anxieties in this regard <e> <s> while i do not feel that we can make a structural change at present of the kind suggested in the amendment there are some fundamental issues which have to be tackled <e> <s> consideration should be given to new guidelines whether they are expressed in a code of practice or in some other way <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to repeat the speeches i made on report and on other occasions <e> <s> i welcome the amendment but i should like to say how much i agree with what has been said by the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones said that it was with a sense of shock that he noticed these words in the bill <e> <s> all i can say is that the sense of shock has come rather late because in recent years we have been building one bad precedent upon another with each bill coming forward and each minister saying this clause after all is no more than a repetition of what has been put in recent legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords it has never at least until recent times been a principle of the conservative party that the gentleman in whitehall really does know best <e> <s> i was not wholly happy to hear my noble friend say that he operated in these matters under some department directive <e> <s> i did not know about it in my time <e> <s> perhaps i should have but i have always believed that while it is perhaps nice for noble lords opposite to have their names on the list of the great and good there are great and good outside the list which is kept in whitehall <e>", "<cs> the compensation should go to the ratepayers my lords <e> <s> they should have their assets back <e> <s> on st january the government in their statement introducing their proposals for reform of the national health service announced that in future local authorities would lose their present rights to appoint direct their own members of health authorities <e> <s> that moved me to ask the minister who had made the statement and who is replying to the debate today why the government persistently regard democratically elected councillors as unrepresentative of local inerests and concerns <e> <s> to that i received the reply that the object was to confine the numbers involved on boards to people who have a straightforward technical contribution to make <e> <s> on that basis i suggested that government might as well be run by permanent secretaries instead of ministers <e> <s> all this was being done i was told and i quote from the statement <e>", "<cs> no my lords bird watchers <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is emphasising the importance of local opinion <e> <s> why then are the government turning off the directly elected representatives of the people <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the minister will give way once again <e> <s> i should like to <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord goodman at least in one respect <e> <s> any human institution is capable of beneficial change <e> <s> i do not believe that anyone who has spoken today would wish to echo the immortal words of the duke of cumberland who said <e>", "<cs> my lords i rely on the report of sir gordon borrie the director general of fair trading who has made severe criticisms of the operation of the financial services act <e> <s> he has expressed similar anxieties about the proposals in the green paper and is reported in that regard in <e>", "<cs> i find myself in the same position as the noble baroness <e> <s> when i first entered the other place i was advised that it was easy to vote for the government if one did not know what one was voting for and that above all one should never listen to the arguments <e> <s> i have rather dropped in this afternoon and i think that i shall quickly drop out <e> <s> i feel that this is a great deal of unnecessary rigmarole <e> <s> it will be extraordinarily difficult for company secretaries to be sure that they understand the law <e> <s> i am afraid that we may once again be making criminals out of honest men for no good purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords if i give a rather tepid welcome to this bill i hope noble lords will understand that it is not because of an excessive affection for the water act for which i was responsible <e> <s> thomas jefferson once wrote that no society can make a perpetual law and that every law naturally expires at the end of years <e> <s> i do not <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend was not so easy about everything if i may <e>", "<cs> my lords following the question put by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter and leaving aside any international considerations does my noble friend agree that so far as concerns this country it is not a statistical matter and it could be argued that here there is less poverty but more misery <e>", "<cs> my lords my interest as chairman of the covent garden trust having been duly declared may i express my satisfaction and pleasure at the answer given by my noble friend <e> <s> is he aware that we are all very grateful that wide discussions are now taking place <e> <s> there is one question i should like to ask <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that there is considerable anxiety about the proposal to have an underground car park <e> <s> the department of transport has said that it has not been consulted <e> <s> will my noble friend ensure that it is <e>", "<cs> i entirely support the general policy of the government ir implementing the widdicombe report <e> <s> however i have a great deal of sympathy for the concern expressed about the nature of this and other provisions in the bill <e> <s> i believe that the provision goes too far in allowing the secretary of state to make regulations to <e>", "<cs> we have gone a little beyond the omission of subsection but in so far as we have gone on to talk about the salary limit then i share the views expressed by the noble earl lord carnarvon and others that appears to be far too low especially if one takes into account such factors as overtime and the special position of people in the fire service who are not involved in giving advice on policy <e> <s> i should like to add also in the light of discussions we have had my hope that my noble friend the minister will at least agree that we should see the draft regulations which are proposed before we go much further <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to enter into the constitutional argument but i should like to endorse entirely what my noble friend lord caldecote said about this issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the secretary of states answer but is he aware that both the governor of the bank of england and the prime minister have expressed concern about the present position <e> <s> does he agree that it is not competition but exploitation <e> <s> does he remember that when we were discussing the brewers he said that competition is good but that there are times when the customer ought to be protected <e> <s> is this not one of those times <e>", "<cs> my lords can the secretary of state give an assurance that if the governments efforts to discourage the banks and others from acting irresponsibly fail they will take further action perhaps by introducing legislation to control usuary because that of course is what it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i share to a large extent the anxieties which have been expressed about this provision by the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey <e> <s> when we joined the community we made great play with the fact that over the years the size and shape of the community budget would change and that many areas in the united kingdom would benefit from the regional development fund <e> <s> there was then of course some discussion about whether or not they would get the full benefit <e> <s> the indications were given that they should get it ought to get it and would get it <e> <s> great play was made with that point at the time <e> <s> it may be inevitable that if the community makes a contribution that will have some effect upon the amount that the government themselves have to provide <e> <s> i should have thought that this measure was a reasonable compromise <e> <s> i should be grateful if my noble friend the minister would indicate whether there is any other statute in which a provision of this kind which on the face of it goes completely against the practice of the community has been made <e>", "<cs> my lords in spite of the statistics and whatever they may show is my noble friend aware that there is widespread concern at the lack of availability of low-cost housing for rent both in urban and rural areas and the consequent increase in homelessness <e> <s> will he give the house some assurance that the government are tackling the problem of homelessness which is worsening every month <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene briefly usually hopelessly simply to say that i entirely endorse what the noble lord lord williams of elvel has said about the excessive use of regulations because the government are unable to draft the primary legislation in a satisfactory form although it runs into hundreds of pages <e>", "<cs> my lords i may have spoken strongly and offended my noble friend <e> <s> however he will recall that both sir oswald mosley and sir stafford cripps believed strongly that there should be skeletal legislation and as much government by order and regulation as conceivably possible <e> <s> it may be that his particular regulation is not unduly sinister but it is the generality of such provisions in statute after statute that i find objectionable <e> <s> it is on that principle that i support the comments of the noble lord lord williams of elvel <e>", "<cs> my lords some satisfaction has been expressed in various quarters this afternoon that this bill is an improvement on what was foreshadowed in the green paper <e> <s> to my mind that is rather like saying that a man who was threatened with two black eyes should be pleased if he gets only one <e> <s> as at present drafted i think that this bill and i say this with respect is bad in some respects and is dangerous in others <e> <s> in so far as there is a popular hope that its introducton will lead to better quicker and cheaper justice i think that that popular hope may well be disappointed <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there is widespread support for the way in which the prime minister responded so swiftly to the telephone call from the president of the united states and promised british support for her ally <e> <s> does he agree that there is some force in the view expressed in your lordships house during the past century by lord harcourt <e> <s> it was to the effect that as regards legality intervention may be justified in international law on many grounds but there is nothing more injudicious than an unsuccessful intervention <e> <s> may we therefore express the hope that the american action will be speedily successful

student loans <e> <s> should it not be withdrawn until the government can say something about what is intended <e>", "<cs> i agree entirely with what has been said already but will the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor when he replies indicate the status of those criteria <e> <s> if these words are added does it ensure that that is what the order will do <e> <s> can he confirm that the position is not as some people have suggested that all those criteria might in fact be ignored and other criteria substituted <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> in so far as the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor already possesses the power to which he referred perhaps he could rely upon that alone without the provision to which i directed my amendment <e> <s> in speaking about subsection i assumed on second reading and by what i said this afternoon that the order-making power derived from clause <e> <s> therefore i took the view that it is not sufficient to rely upon either any affirmative resolution or upon consultation <e>", "<cs> will my noble and learned friend explain what enactments past present or future he may wish to repeal or amend <e> <s> will that be made clear in subsequent proceedings <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down is it his understanding as it is mine that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor said he could make this provision in any event by order under clause just as equally even if it were put into the bill he could take it away by order under clause <e>", "<cs> i entirely share the view expressed so cogently by the noble and learned lord lord roskill <e> <s> i must point out that as i understand the position it does not matter whether the provision is included or not because the lord chancellor of the day could put it in if he wanted to <e> <s> even if it is not included in the act a future labour government could put it in by order which would require only the affirmative resolution <e> <s> so we need not worry too much about that <e> <s> the present lord chancellor will probably not include it <e> <s> a future lord chancellor may do so but it is all governed by order not by statute <e>", "<cs> could not a future lord chancellor make an order under clause repealing that provision <e> <s> having repealed that provision could he make the amendment now required <e>", "<cs> i rise to oppose the question that clause stand part of the bill <e> <s> i do so in the context of the debates we have had this afternoon <e> <s> i think it is generally agreed that part i of the bill is in essence an enabling part and many will feel that it ought to be a separate bill <e> <s> it is an enabling measure couched in the widest possible terms <e>", "<cs> i hope the committee will feel it has been right to have a general debate on the scope of clause <e> <s> i am grateful to those members who have given some support to the anxieties that i have expressed <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble and

solicitor as lord chancellor or even one day a major-general <e> <s> all i would say is that i believe some aspects of clause give substance to the idea that the question of constitutional reform is

abuse of power by the executive <e> <s> having said that and having received assurances from my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor that he will look at the way in which clause is presently drafted i shall not seek to go further tonight <e>", "<cs> i do not want to go back over clause but i understood from the stand-part debate on that clause that my noble and learned friend was willing to look at the way in which subsections and of that clause had been drafted in order to make the position clear not least in regard to whether affirmative or negative resolutions were required <e> <s> i hope that he can now repeat that assurance <e> <s> we might return on report to the drafting of clause and perhaps to that of clause which deals with the making of orders <e>", "<cs> i too have been racked by doubt as the debate has proceeded <e> <s> i began from the point of view that the clause was too wide and made proposals which should be dealt with by primary legislation <e> <s> of course

necessary and has stated that he will consider the position <e> <s> i therefore ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the amendments proposed by my noble friend lord rawlinson <e> <s> in the interventions which i have made in the course of the discussions on the bill i have expressed concern as have others about the width of the powers given to the lord chancellor and the executive frequently under subordinate legislation <e> <s> i welcome the amendment because it gives the committee the chance to consider the proper role of the lord chancellor in regard to a bill which has considerable constitutional implications <e>", "<cs> with respect i would not for one moment suggest that <e> <s> i only say as i believe my noble and learned friend said that the chairmanship of and responsibility for the advisory committee should be taken over by the lord chief justice and the judiciary <e> <s> my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor will remain in full control of all the responsibilities that he already possesses <e>", "<cs> it is most unfair that the draftsmen should be criticised <e> <s> there are only draftsmen who are paid an average salary of per year <e> <s> they must deal with a mass of legislation under the direction of the minister <e> <s> sometimes ministers such as the late lord duncan-sandys under whom i served liked to draft all the legislation themselves <e> <s> that is not necessarily a good idea <e> <s> however the minister is responsible and the lord chancellor must take responsibility for the drafting <e>", "<cs> one misunderstanding arose the other day as to the number of days allotted to the committee stage <e> <s> i had always understood that agreement had been reached on about six days but now the indication is that it is five <e> <s> i am bound to say that i think that that is totally unreasonable and that on a matter of this kind an agreement through the usual channels ought not necessarily to be regarded as in any way binding <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that the bill will provide better quicker or cheaper justice <e> <s> i must say that over and over again even if it is a repetition of a second reading speech <e> <s> however i am brought to my feet by the speech of my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> he has suggested that members who have spoken in this and other debates have not been concerned with cost <e> <s> as i understood the speech of my noble and learned friend lord rawlinson he referred specifically to cost <e>", "<cs> for the reasons i supported my noble and learned friend lord rawlinson in respect of clause i also support him on this occasion <e> <s> at that time the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor explained that it was difficult to substitute the lord chief justice because as he said again this afternoon various heads of division have various responsibilities <e> <s> therefore it is logical in respect of this clause that the master of the rolls should be the substitute for the lord chancellor <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale has deserved our thanks for drawing attention to a situation which is causing increasing concern <e> <s> no one can doubt the increase in the quantity of legislation <e> <s> we have certainly come a long way since a reforming liberal government in was content with pages of legislation including the finance act <e> <s> i regret to say we have also come a very long way since the days when in opposition the conservative party criticised the labour government for overworking parliament <e> <s> i remember how we demanded less and better legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures which i quoted which were kindly supplied to me by the noble lord the leader of the house make that comparison <e> <s> taking into account the change of format the amount of legislation is much greater <e>", "<cs> my lords i quoted government figures which were compiled on a basis which shows a fair comparison <e> <s> there were only three years in which pages were exceeded they were and <e> <s> they cannot all concern consolidation legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to point out that the figures i quoted excluded consolidation and scottish acts <e>", "<cs> is the problem not what they are able to provide but what they think they are able to provide which may be totally inadequate <e>", "<cs> i made in effect a second reading speech when we had an amendment to clause but i express the hope that my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor will have regard to what my noble friend lady elles said <e> <s> my view is that the ordinary person seeking help in buying or selling a house is better protected by the law as it stands than he would be by the governments proposals <e>", "<cs> i intervene briefly to refer more specifically to the clause itself <e> <s> i appreciate that the purpose of the clause as it stands is restrictive <e> <s> but apart from the reference of my noble friend lord peyton of yeovil to the evolutionary process to which my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor referred at second reading we have to consider the intervention this afternoon of the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale <e> <s> he quite clearly indicated that he hoped that this would be the thin end of the wedge leading to a form of future legislation which might be closer to the american system <e> <s> the american system would at least have this disadvantage <e> <s> it would be perfectly clear from the outset what the basis of the fee would be <e> <s> if for example the lawyers appearing for <e>", "<cs> if the clause is accepted will not the lord chancellor be able to say to his right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer i am now in a much better position to resist any improvement at all in legal aid <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor might consider agreeing so that we do not have to have this discussion too often that in any case where the henry viii clause is employed that is to say where there is a power to amend or repeal the primary legislation there will always be the affirmative resolution procedure <e> <s> if we received that undertaking it would save a great deal of time because that point has come up time and again in recent legislation <e>", "<cs> rose to call attention to the case for a select committee to scrutinise all bills coming before parliament and to report whether such bills contain insufficiently defined administrative powers or propose any inappropriate delegation of legislative powers and to move for papers <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord beloff suggested that as there might be a little time left at the end of this debate i might expand i trust briefly on some of the points that i made <e> <s> the noble lord lord diamond said that i had understated my case <e> <s> i must say that that is an accusation which has rarely been levelled against me <e> <s> but having come from the hurly-burly of another place i have been told that your lordships do not appreciate language that is over the top <e> <s> i tried to suggest a fairly simple practical solution of the kind which was designed to take this particular controversy out of the political arena so far as that is possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate what my noble and learned friend has done and i appreciate his explanation that it was an undertaking in relation to this specific bill <e> <s> i may have gone a little too far in the debate the other day in saying that it was a precedent for all occasions <e> <s> however i hope that it will be found to be a useful precedent for future bills <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government must be assumed to give some priority to this matter by bringing forward part i of the bill at all as part i is manifestly useless unless the government are prepared to provide the resources necessary to bring it into effect <e> <s> i am bound to say that i am not wholly enamoured of annual reports as a means of dealing with such matters <e> <s> i have known it to happen often in the past that ministers will confess and avoid by promising an annual report <e> <s> however if there is to be an annual report as my noble and learned friend has promised i do not see why it should not be buttressed in some way by the kind of amendment which the noble lord lord mishcon has proposed <e>", "<cs> my lord i support the policy of student loans and to that extent i support the bill <e> <s> i am influenced i must confess to a considerable extent by the fact that like the noble lord lord dainton i benefited as an undergraduate from a loan from my college for which i am extremely grateful <e> <s> i am therefore not at all impressed by students marching with banners that say grants not loans <e> <s> they are more privileged than they apparently appreciate <e> <s> as my noble friend the minister explained we are already providing the most generous system of student loans in western europe and one which is infinitely better than the arrangements in the united states or japan <e> <s> as i understand it that is what we shall continue to do <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that the united kingdom has just about the best record in implementing the directives agreed under the single european act and above all the best record in keeping the law once we have agreed to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the generality of the governments proposal <e> <s> however will the government give consideration to the idea that was put forward in <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble and learned lord agree that a distinction might be made where the act of parliament inadvertently conflicts with european community law <e> <s> might not a different position arise if the act of parliament were to say <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether it is appropriate to speak now to amendment no <e> <s> za <e> <s> this is not just a simple drafting amendment <e> <s> it is a matter of some importance <e> <s> as i have on many occasions severely criticised the government for their excessive use of henry viii clauses i wish warmly to welcome this amendment <e> <s> i thank my noble friend the minister for having deleted these most objectionable subsections <e>", "<cs> my lords we should all welcome the initiative of the noble lord lord kirkhill in opening the debate and congratulate him on the way he has done so <e> <s> i agree with everything he has said <e> <s> as a member of the council of europe he of course has present knowledge and can speak with much more authority than i can <e> <s> a good many years have passed since i led first the conservative delegation to the council of europe and then the conservative delegation to the european parliament <e> <s> however i still maintain my interest in both those bodies <e> <s> their roles as i see it are in no way antagonistic they are essentially complementary <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that there would be more goodwill and possibly more real agreed progress if there were fewer of these summit meetings <e> <s> is it not most regrettable that time after time heads of government who can never agree anything <e>"]
