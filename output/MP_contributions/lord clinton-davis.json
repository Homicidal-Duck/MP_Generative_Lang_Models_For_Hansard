["<cs> my lords i feel very privileged to be seeking your lordships indulgence in this important debate on the environment <e> <s> at the same time i am somewhat intimidated by the excellence of the speeches not least that of the noble viscount whose maiden speech preceded mine <e> <s> i should like at the outset to declare a specific interest as chairman of the advisory committee on pollution of the sea and as a member of a number of other environmental organisations <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister indicate whether the government have pursued with the government of brazil the hopelessly inequitable system of land tenure which makes it impossible for the indigenous people of the rain forests to do other than eke out a bare existence by the destruction of that which is necessary for their survival <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord indicate o the house how his answers today square with the of t-made remarks of the prime minister and president bush that countries in the developing world should essentially be left to their own devices in resolving problems and avoiding the catastrophic environmental mistakes made by the industrialised countries <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that considerable action is being taken to improve airport capacity on the continent of europe <e> <s> is he also aware of the deleterious effects that that could have unless action of the most urgent kind is taken on our ability within the united kingdom to function as an effective centre for air traffic <e>", "<cs> my lords at the outset perhaps i may as a new boy congratulate my noble friend lord richard <e> <s> he is a friend in every sense of the word and i was delighted to sit next to him this afternoon and hear his remarkable maiden speech <e> <s> i congratulate too the noble lord lord jenkins upon initiating the debate on this important issue <e> <s> like him i suppose that i should enter into a confessional which is a term of art when it comes to european community affairs but somewhat different from the confession that he made <e> <s> i readily confess that my views have drifted apart from those of my noble friend lord stoddart <e> <s> they are based on my experience before i became a commissioner and on that gained during the four years that i held the office <e> <s> i also congratulate the noble lord lord aldington on his important appointment <e> <s> i am sure that the house recognises that he will shoulder his burdens with the skill and sincerity for which he is so respected in this house and elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords when the treasury or the chancellor of the exchequer specifically calculates the average figure for european community inflation does the noble lord not agree that the united kingdom is included in that average figure <e> <s> therefore does not the situation appear to be a little awry <e>", "<cs> my lords if the united kingdom were excluded does the noble lord agree that the european community figure would average about per cent <e> <s> as against the per cent <e> <s> that the chancellor alleges it is <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first of all congratulate my noble friend lord williams on the impressive way in which he made out an indictment against the government an indictment which has gone unanswered by the noble lord lord trefgarne <e> <s> my noble friend adverted to what was perhaps a chance remark made by the present secretary of state for trade and industry when he entered that department first of all <e> <s> he asked what is this place for <e> <s> i suspect that he might have asked a similar question judging by his record when he entered the department of the environment <e> <s> clearly it was necessary that he should be transferred to another department after his record there <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the statistics relating to accidents at that site represent per cent <e> <s> of the workforce compared with per cent <e> <s> in the construction industry as a whole which is one of the most dangerous industries in the country <e> <s> is he further aware that the acceptance of the inevitability of accidents represented by a number of noble lords in questioning him today is in itself unacceptable <e> <s> what the house surely wants to know from him is what action the government are prepared to take to reduce the incidence of accidents and particularly whether they are prepared to set up an independent inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord indicate what action the government are disposed to take <e>", "<cs> my lords when the secretary of state for trade and industry canvassed the idea of a two-speed europe and inner and outer circles was that really consistent with the policy as elucidated by the secretary of state for foreign affairs and other government ministers save perhaps for the prime minister <e> <s> is it not a case of the secretary of state for trade and industry like prometheus being totally unbound <e>", "<cs> my lords while one has a very high regard for the ability of sir david hannay why was it that other member states took a view contrary to that of the united kingdom government and were represented by ministers <e> <s> were not the issues affecting the steel industry small and medium sized enterprises research and development and shipbuilding of sufficient importance for a minister from this government to participate in the meeting <e> <s> does the minister share my view that the secretary of state for trade and industry was being wholly consistent <e> <s> after all when he was secretary of state for the environment he did not attend a single environment council meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords apart from being frivolous does the ministers reply not cause a very great disservice to the interests of this country and the community <e> <s> it is also wholly inconsistent with a reply given a few days before the industry council by mr douglas hogg who said <e>", "<cs> am i not correct in thinking that in regard to the or cases my noble friend lord mcintosh was referring to major processes as distinct from the point made by the minister <e> <s> the main question i put to the noble lord in this brief intervention is this have not the government elected to rely on deterrents rather than incentives <e> <s> one wonders what happened to the recommendations of professor pearce in relation to the governments approach <e> <s> not so very long ago we were led to suppose that incentives to provide cleaner production which was environmentally friendly was something that the government were likely to adhere to in the future <e> <s> what has happened to that approach <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may <e>", "<cs> i am always intrigued by the eloquent interventions of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> i had a great deal of pleasure working with him when he was chairman of the civil aviation authority and i was the minister with responsibility for aviation <e> <s> he will be the first to recall that the civil aviation authority was given powers by the government which i believe was led by edward heath precisely the same in principle as my noble friend lord mcintosh envisages in this case <e> <s> the civil aviation authority was established long before those powers were granted but eventually it was decided that there were many technical matters which required independence of government and objectivity <e> <s> i believe that is what my noble friend is reaching out for here <e>", "<cs> i should like to explore something with the government on the basis of the amendment that has been moved by the noble lord lord ross <e> <s> in fact as the noble lord said it is important to have a national strategy dealing with environmental policy which invokes the aid of a whole range of voluntary organisations non-governmental organisations and so on <e>", "<cs> while i appreciate what has been said by the minister in response to the question affecting the valdez principles i wonder whether he would like to reflect on ways of pursuing the point rather more actively than has already been done <e> <s> i do not deny for one moment that the government have addressed some of these points <e> <s> on reflection perhaps the minister would care to write to me having considered the application of the valdez principles on a more effective way in which the government can address the specific point <e> <s> perhaps he can do that in conjunction with his right honourable friend the minister at the department of trade and industry <e>", "<cs> the minister has not begun to answer the points made by the noble lord lord lucas <e> <s> my own mind is not entirely made up on this issue but the noble lord raised two important points <e> <s> the first was that vital interests according to him the aluminium industry had not been consulted about matters affecting large combustion plant <e> <s> he then raised the argument concerning the control of pollution act embracing just such a section <e> <s> if that is the situation why cannot the government apply precisely the same principles as were devised for the control of pollution act <e> <s> will the noble lord answer those two points <e>", "<cs> the question of the governments credentials is seriously in issue here <e> <s> i speak with some authority because i continued the negotiations in connection with the draft directive on this matter which i inherited from commissioner narjes in <e> <s> i say that the credentials of the government are seriously in issue because until that time and indeed beyond the government were disputing cause and effect about acid deposition <e> <s> they were fighting the commissions draft directive not simply on the matter of detail but on principle <e> <s> every speech that was made by the noble lord lord marshall every speech that was made by a government minister on this issue every contribution in the ministerial council was aimed to obfuscate and to deny the opportunity for the draft directive to go ahead and of course unanimity was required <e>", "<cs> that is hardly a reply to the points that i made less elegantly i admit than the minister <e> <s> will the minister reply to the substance of what i had to say <e> <s> does he proclaim that the governments record in relation to this matter justifies our having confidence in what he has said tonight to the committee <e> <s> what possible evidence can he produce to support that proposition <e>", "<cs> the minister referred to a possibility <e> <s> is that all there is <e> <s> what certainty is there that the objectives defined in the directive will be achieved <e>", "<cs> i always thought it was argued that there was no such thing as hypothecation and that the road fund licence contributions did not in fact go towards a specific road fund building programme <e> <s> is the minister now changing treasury policy <e>", "<cs> when the government signed the single european act although the prime minister seems to have a somewhat frustrated memory about that they accepted the principle that environmental policy would be integrated into all other policies <e> <s> on the evidence that is available i hardly think that that is being taken very seriously in whitehall at the present time in so far as transport policy is concerned <e>", "<cs> i shall not delay the committee for long <e> <s> there appeared to be an unseemly unity between the three car manufacturing countries and their manufacturers at that time <e> <s> what has happened to lean burn <e> <s> many protestations were made about it but little has developed <e> <s> i heard the prime minister speak on television proclaiming that the government are in the lead as regards catalytic converters <e> <s> if anyone was re-writing history it was the prime minister <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that the majority of member states of the european community apply a substantially lower speed limit to heavy goods vehicles and coaches than we apply in this country <e> <s> is he aware that in fact there is a proposal on the table of transport ministers which envisages just such an approach <e> <s> what is the governments current attitude to that proposal which apparently would receive the support of no less a person than my noble friend lord stoddart who is not normally an advocate of european legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister explain further to the point raised by the noble viscount lord cross how the governments policy or lack of policy in relation to the rail link is consonant with the commitment the government entered into in the single european act that environmental considerations should be an essential component of all other policies including transport policies <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble viscount for that answer <e> <s> does he not recognise that the package of measures put forward by the commission goes far wider than the issue of cabotage and the single market important indeed vital though that is <e> <s> am i to understand from his answer that apart from the question of the community register which in my respectful submission was inserted rather too prematurely the government support the other proposals which are outlined by the commission <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount agree that the results of the last transport council were extremely disappointing in that <e>", "<cs> the contributions made by the noble viscount lord mountgarret and the noble lord lord jenkin are unduly negative i am not convinced that there need be regulations and laws for this <e> <s> we are seeking through the amendment to probe the governments intentions <e>", "<cs> with respect the noble lord went on to denigrate the idea that possibly an effective way of dealing with the matter would be by illustrating the difficulties <e> <s> my approach is rather different <e> <s> it would be to see whether something could be done rather than to approach the matter in the way that he did <e> <s> his approach was to say effectively that nothing could be done the practical problems were too difficult <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down if he is in favour of the principle of stimulating a system of self-regulation can he indicate how the government will go about offering some kind of encouragement to industrial groups to do precisely that <e>", "<cs> with respect i believe that the noble lords answer to the case which was presented very reasonably by my noble friend lord graham indicates a somewhat high-handed attitude on the part of the department not simply about local authorities <e> <s> as my noble friend said the secretary of state has the discretion to determine in this instance whether the local authority may have a locus in the matter <e> <s> it also indicates a high-handed attitude towards the local populace <e>", "<cs> i listened with care but not with total comprehension to the remarks of the noble lord lord mccoll <e> <s> it is not because he did not explain the matter very well but that it involves some knowledge of technology <e> <s> i confess that that is beyond me <e> <s> perhaps i may turn to something a little more mundane <e> <s> what worries me is that as i understand it the oecd is in the process of revising its guidelines <e> <s> it has produced a draft paper which is currently being considered by government <e>", "<cs> we welcome the position taken by the minister in his response <e> <s> the fact that he is prepared without commitment to reconsider the point means that we shall clearly have to return to it on report <e> <s> i thank noble lords who have spoken in support of the amendment <e> <s> above all i thank the minister <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has said that this is not the correct vehicle through which to <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the lord chancellor for that answer <e> <s> will he indicate more specifically the lines along which the government are thinking <e> <s> how is it possible for example to impose fines against aberrant member states <e> <s> might the government think in terms of extending the rules relating to competition law to other areas of policy where there is a failure to comply with the law <e> <s> in that connection i have in mind invoking the power of the sanctions of fines against those responsible rather than dealing directly with governments <e> <s> can the noble lord give the house some further specific indication in this regard <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the comparative figures that the noble lord the lord chancellor indicated in relation to breaches of the law by britain and germany respectively will not reflect the score to night <e> <s> however i wonder whether the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i have now fathomed the reason for these extraordinary house of commons-like outbursts <e> <s> i apologise <e> <s> i hope the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor can indicate how long the government are likely to take in their consideration of these matters and whether for example a statement will be made before the end of the year <e> <s> in so far as there is no dock available for aberrant ministers at the european court of justice does not the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor agree that there may be an overwhelming case for this measure being the only effective sanction in certain instances <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister reply to the first part of the question asked by my noble friend lord williams of elvel <e> <s> how many landfill sites where there are no schemes as described in his answer are unaffected by such schemes <e> <s> what study have the government made into such situations <e> <s> do the government propose to extend the scheme upon which they have already embarked <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord indicate whether the secretary of state has considered the use to some degree at least of military airfields for civil and commercial flying <e> <s> if so what discussions have taken place with the relevant authorities to procure that objective <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that while everything must be done to encourage the manufacture of substances which are satisfactory there are difficulties in relation to hcfcs and hfcs which in fact cause some damage to the ozone layer and contribute to global warming respectively <e> <s> therefore is there not a case for attempting to set international limits on those substitutes <e>", "<cs> the noble lord seemed initially to indicate that if there were any doubt in relation to the ouster of judicial review the matter might be tackled but he then went on to assert that the machinery listed in amendments nos <e> <s> and might be inappropriate <e> <s> does he agree that if there is any doubt about it apparently the government assert that there is no intention of that kind it would be as well if the minister were to agree to the principle being inserted by way of amendment at a later stage <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down in the course of his remarks to which i listened with great care i was at a loss to understand why he omitted to deal with the last point raised by my noble friend lord mishcon <e> <s> it was an issue of principle on which he sought to elicit a reply from the noble earl <e> <s> if a different phraseology were introduced into the bill to the effect that nothing in this act shall prohibit the right of judicial review where it operates if that was the quotation that my noble friend used what is wrong with that <e> <s> why should not the certainty of that right prevail in relation to the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord indicate how many breaches of environmental directives are subject to proceedings already in the european court against the united kingdom how many are currently being investigated and how many complaints to his knowledge have been registered in relation to bathing water and drinking water directives <e>", "<cs> my lords without commenting on that case is it not clear that those powers were invested in the commission to deal with situations where serious abuses of monopoly power could take place or had taken place and that it is necessary in such circumstances for the commission to avail itself of such powers at relatively short notice because somehow vital documents frequently have a habit of disappearing if a longer period of notice is given by the commission of its requirement to carry out those searches <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the minister for that reply is he aware that the leader of the research team dr bowlt has alleged that his study is being hampered by reason of the fact that the government have failed to produce information concerning the total amount of radioactive waste being dumped in london <e>", "<cs> i am quoting my lords <e> <s> dr bowlt said <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say that i am terribly sorry that i have upset the noble earl lord halsbury but he tends to be easily upset <e> <s> can the minister say whether the indications given by the leader of the research team conflict with assertions that have previously been made that this particular isotope breaks down before it enters the food chain <e> <s> does the minister agree that if there is a conflict the sooner it can be cleared up the better <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord reconsider the word freeloaders <e> <s> after all those exempt from rates were often people who were disabled or infirm and those who could ill afford to pay <e> <s> therefore he should not persist in making the implicit rebuke that he made today <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the minister <e> <s> he agreed to examine the question of whether my first amendment is consistent with the thinking of the government <e> <s> therefore we can return to that matter at a later stage <e> <s> in so far as the last amendments relate to costs they will be dealt with within his previous remarks <e> <s> i am obliged and wish to consider what the minister has said <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as a relatively new member of this house i could not fail to be other than enormously impressed by the quality of the debate its dignity its calm its moderation and its continuing interest not least the very thoughtful and interesting speech of the noble lord lord elibank <e> <s> it is interesting to note that the debate has been graced by a former prime minister three former foreign secretaries although one of those was also prime minister a former president of the european commission and two former ambassadors to the united nations <e> <s> that is a formidable list of participants <e>", "<cs> my lords like my noble friends lord mcintosh and lord parry i believe that this debate and many others must be seen against the backcloth of the publication of the glossy white paper <e> <s> i wholly agreed with the editorial contained in the <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down i wonder whether she would develop further the argument on conditionality <e> <s> are the government taking the stance that they would be under no obligation to meet even the deadline if one two or three other major countries showed no application of a similar kind <e> <s> under those circumstance will the government contract out of their obligation <e>", "<cs> my lords initially i thought that the noble lord lord campbell of croy was on to an unanswerable point <e> <s> i became less convinced when i heard the response from my noble friend lord mcintosh <e> <s> i should be interested to know whether the noble lord lord campbell would support this amendment if he were satisfied on the point that he made <e> <s> i suspect that the answer is no but it is an intriguing thought <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support my noble friend lord dean in his very vigorous and justifiable defence of local government and of the role that it can play in giving effect to a truly effective national environmental policy <e> <s> i at once declare my interest <e> <s> i served as a member of a local authority in inner london for more than years <e> <s> in that period i learnt to respect local government <e> <s> the role local government was permitted to play had been underscored by successive governments including the one in which i served <e>", "<cs> my lords with all the good will in the world i cannot go along with the comments made by noble lords opposite that great clarity has been introduced into the matter by the statements of ministers to which i referred <e> <s> i am afraid that all they have managed to do is to cast a blinding ray of darkness upon this important issue <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has touching faith in self-regulation which is compounded by experience <e> <s> be that as it may and let us assume that in this instance her faith appears to be justified does she say that no qualifications are likely <e> <s> she took up the point made by the noble and learned lord lord renton <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to be put right about that point but i grew into a sort of habit about the noble lord <e> <s> unfortunately i continue to consider him as learned <e> <s> if i am wrong about that i apologise <e>", "<cs> my lords i have never found conservative members of parliament altogether convincing before so this sets a precedent for me <e> <s> i find that the arguments that have been adduced by the noble lords opposite totally convincing <e> <s> they have undermined whatever i have said <e> <s> this is a precedent which is not likely to be repeated but i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if it were possible at this stage to adopt the suggestion of the noble lord lord renton i should do so <e> <s> i cannot <e> <s> i am impressed by what he said and perhaps the most appropriate course for me to take now is to consider the possibility of coming back to the issue at a later stage <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords like most noble lords who have spoken i congratulate the noble earl lord cranbrook and those who served with him on his committee on what is an excellent report <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord shackleton for that intervention <e> <s> it has been said many times indeed in my maiden speech in this house i drew attention to it that it is necessary for developed countries to be able to deploy their expertise technical and technological resources in the way that my noble friend has in mind <e> <s> i fully <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down i apologise to the house because i was unavoidably detained <e> <s> i wonder whether he is aware that successive governments and those who deal with night flying from our main airports especially those in the london region come under great pressure from the operators particularly during the summer months <e> <s> as a distinguished chairman of the caa the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter will recall that fact <e> <s> if the government or the other authorities were to bend to those pressures <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the government with their vast array of civil servants have much greater access than the opposition to the <e>", "<cs> my lords notwithstanding the thoroughly unsatisfactory nature of the reply i do not wish to press the matter further <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> we need to look very carefully at what he has said <e> <s> i do not propose to press the matter further <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not having a good night regarding drafting indeed i am constantly being flawed <e> <s> on this occasion i willingly accept the observation made by the noble lord <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the flawed amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will recognise that the noble baroness has been very <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that reply <e> <s> as someone who has served in government before i am familiar with the wrong vehicle argument <e> <s> it is useful and perhaps it is right in these circumstances <e> <s> we have obtained from the government today

pursued elsewhere <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot say that i am satisfied by that reply <e> <s> to say that these are issues which should be ventilated in the courts by litigation is to surrender an important principle in terms of legislation <e> <s> legislation should be clear and it should as far as possible avoid litigation in

proposed by the commission is going to be supported by the government <e> <s> that will cause considerable anxiety to many people <e> <s> however i am not going to raise the issue further at this stage <e> <s> as i say i am not satisfied with the response <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords at this time of night it is difficult to absorb everything <e> <s> i am sure that the noble earl did not absorb everything that i said and i am not sure that i absorbed everything that he said <e> <s> it is a mutual situation <e> <s> i should like to consider what he said

was demanded at committee stage and the government have responded positively <e> <s> i wish to pose one or two questions at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i hope that i may repeat a question that i put to the noble baroness on the position of the secretary of state <e> <s> does that cover the position of the minister of agriculture fisheries and food <e> <s> i hope that i may continue talking for a little longer while the fourth cavalry provides assistance <e>", "<cs> my lords first with reference to amendment no <e> <s> a i am glad that the minister has so far resisted it but it would be premature for me to comment further upon it save to say that i am concerned in the light of the statement he made tonight which i shall have to consider <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down will be indicate whether the recording industry was consulted at all most particularly by the home office since the time the amendments were tabled <e> <s> is he also aware that attempts were made to consult ministers but nothing came of that <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down i did not hear the last paragraph of what he had to say and i wonder whether he would mind repeating those few words <e>", "<cs> i meant the penultimate paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble earl <e> <s> frankly i am as unimpressed with the arguments that he adduced in the penultimate paragraph as with those in the ultimate paragraph <e> <s> but having said that i shall read very carefully what he said <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords are we to understand from that answer that the government abdicate all responsibility for having any influence in the matter <e> <s> is the minister aware that with the rising incidence of crime on british rail any attempt to reconstruct the nature of the police force on british rail which will in effect mean a diminution in the services provided can lead only to considerable consternation on the part of the public bearing in <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of that reply does the minister agree that the consultation process suggested by my noble friend lord underhill is imperative in this instance <e> <s> after all we are talking are we not about the publics interest in any form of restructuring which might involve according to the internal report the shutting down of something like one third of all the police stations related to the railways <e> <s> that could lead to considerable delays in the calling out of police to deal with criminal activities <e>", "<cs> my lords i found the intervention of the noble lord lord renton interesting as always <e> <s> however i was disappointed that he should liken what we seek to achieve to any consultation with the treasury which is bound to be fruitless <e> <s> we seek to have worthwhile consultations <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord renton raised an interesting point <e> <s> i agree with the minister that there can be no doubt at all that the normal procedures in relation to community law must be followed <e> <s> if it is regulations they take direct effect as from the date prescribed if it is a directive the government must legislate here <e> <s> what the government are doing is absolutely right <e> <s> they are taking the power under clause to give effect to community obligations <e> <s> i do not believe that there is anything very radical about that <e> <s> also there is the wider power to give effect to international agreements on a wider scale than the community <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great pleasure to follow the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter with whom as he said i had the pleasure of working as a minister and when he was chairman of the civil aviation authority <e> <s> i think that ours was a positive worthwhile and happy working relationship <e> <s> he is always eloquent persuasive and a wee bit provocative as he has been this afternoon <e> <s> he has not disappointed us in that regard <e> <s> if i join issue with him on one or two matters he will not be surprised <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord suggesting that with the increased investment which although it is too late we all welcome the transport system in london will begin to compare with the transport systems in most other european cities <e> <s> that is certainly not the case today <e> <s> what do the government propose to do about the congestion resulting from the use of private cars <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that one of the problems is that we do not have in this country an integrated transport system and that under this government there is no sign of one emerging <e> <s> is he further aware that notwithstanding the quasi-assurances he has given to the house today there is deep anxiety not simply in the south west and in the midlands but throughout the northern part of this country that there are not sufficient nor are there likely to be sufficient freight routes to the channel tunnel <e> <s> that may have serious effects on british industry particularly as approaches <e>", "<cs> my lords having regard to the ministers proper anxiety about drunk-driving is he aware that the british medical association has estimated that about casualties last year were directly attributable to drunk-driving <e> <s> is there not therefore a very strong case for introducing a system of random breath testing <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord on the other side of the house i wish to congratulate the noble viscount on his first appearance at the dispatch box <e> <s> he has acquitted himself very well <e> <s> perhaps i may ask him whether the government intend to take any steps whatsoever to encourage the extension of free directory inquiry calls to pensioners <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his very careful exposition of the bill and in particular of part iii rather than part i of the bill <e> <s> it is extraordinary that today of all days this particular government at this time in their history should have opted to debate a bill about holes <e> <s> i wonder whether that is a coincidence or a freudian landslide <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister be kind enough to confirm that british companies are very badly placed and are seriously lagging behind our industrial competitors in regard to trade with eastern europe at the present time <e> <s> in order to remedy that situation are the government taking a positive attitude towards recent european commission initiatives to stimulate the european communitys reinsurance pool to assist export credit insurance and other initiatives that have been taken to stimulate investment <e>", "<cs> my lords far from talking down british industry which was a rather trite and cheap comment is it not a fact that we all have an interest in seeking to stimulate british industry <e> <s> is it not a fact that as
