["<cs> my lords this evening i find myself in what is i think a somewhat unusual although i am certain not a unique situation <e> <s> i rise to address this house ostensibly for the first time <e> <s> in fact i first addressed this house on th december <e> <s> it is true that i addressed it from the bar nevertheless it was this house meeting in this chamber <e> <s> i advert to that experience tonight because it illustrated to me for the first time the great kindness indulgence and consideration that is shown by this house to maiden speakers of either kind who are in difficulties <e> <s> i was in difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with some very real regret that i rise to support this bill <e> <s> my regret stems from the fact that as i see it it really should have been quite unnecessary <e> <s> disputes between citizens in any complex society are quite inevitable <e> <s> in some ways an index of the advanced nature of that society is the extent to which it provides adequate systems for disputes settlement <e> <s> by adequate i mean efficient and cheap <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a real and personal delight to be present in the house this evening on the occasion of the maiden speech of my noble and learned friend lord goff of chievely the excellence of that speech will take no judge by surprise and indeed will take no member of the bar by surprise <e> <s> i join in the congratulations which have already been tendered to him <e>", "<cs> my lords for the past few years i have been intimately connected with both branches of the legal profession not only as a judge but as president of the inns of court council and in relation to the solicitors branch of the profession as master of the rolls <e> <s> over that period to my own knowledge both branches on their own initiative have made tremendous improvements in their organisation in their practices in their rules and in their complaints procedure <e> <s> neither branch would i know suggest that there is nothing more to be done <e> <s> indeed a considerable part of my time too <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the noble lord lord campbell of alloway on having revived this bill if that is the proper term <e> <s> it has two great merits as i see it merits which indeed may be almost unique <e> <s> first it is extremely brief <e> <s> secondly it has some importance <e> <s> its brevity is self-evident but i should like to say a word or two about its importance <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that it would not be so taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> i have not looked at the possibility that if industrial action is started the -day period is no longer relevant <e> <s> if that is right it is reasonably clear that the courts could achieve the entire purpose of the bill by simply refusing to impose an injunction until a short period has elapsed in which the union could start industrial action and then impose the injunction <e> <s> that would be a most unfortunate position in which to place the judges but they might have to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add my congratulations to those already expressed to the noble lord lord byron <e> <s> the legally qualified consumer of legal services is a relatively rare animal if one excludes conveyancing upon which every sensible barrister and judge rushes at once to a solicitor for advice <e> <s> however leaving that aside anybody who is legally qualified who has my noble friends experience of using legal services will inevitably be able to make a great contribution in the later stages of the bill and indeed generally <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged <e> <s> i had appreciated that the guiding principle took priority over the statutory objective <e> <s> the statutory objective has a different meaning in this bill from that contained in the white paper <e>", "<cs> my noble and learned friend lord ackner said that one of the vices of subsection is that one can consult and ignore <e> <s> i appreciate that there are fields in which it is <e>", "<cs> with respect they can on counterclaim without consent <e>", "<cs> i merely say that it is a curious irony that the high court is by far the quickest and simplest way of raising issues of judicial review <e> <s> i would not make that claim for any other part of the work of the high court but the judicial review jurisdiction has been developed in such a way that anybody who thinks he has been the victim of an abuse of power by local or central government i use that phrase in a very loose sense has only to go along to the crown office in the strand and explain his problem <e> <s> within certain obvious constitutional limits he will receive advice about the kind of form that he ought to fill in it is only a question of filling in a form and supporting it with a simple affidavit and in some cases within hours and certainly within a very few days the matter will go before a single specialist judge <e> <s> there is a fee i believe of payable on the proceedings <e> <s> the matter goes before a specialist judge who straightaway will say whether or not there is a case fit to be investigated <e>", "<cs> the debate appears to have proceeded upon the basis that a novel provision is being introduced by my noble and learned friend <e> <s> if i attend any future committee debates on the bill i must bring with me a copy of the county courts act <e> <s> however i am certain that the provision is taken from the transfer provisions of the county courts act <e>", "<cs> under that provision if one begins ones case in the wrong county court and the question of transfer arises it can be transferred to another convenient county court or struck out <e>", "<cs> i oppose the amendment for the very reason given by the noble lord <e> <s> it is wholly inconceivable that a court would act contrary to the proposed amendment <e> <s> i find it slightly irksome for parliament to be able to tell judges that they really must act in accordance with the principles of natural justice <e>", "<cs> i sincerely hope that my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor will do no such thing <e> <s> if this is a convenient moment i hope that i may express my views <e>", "<cs> one of the things that always charms me about the noble lord lord mishcon is that he is so able an advocate <e> <s> in particular he obeys rule that is never ask a question unless you know the answer <e> <s> it is true that the committee has not met for about two years <e> <s> on the whole that has been to the profit not only of the committee but of its deliberations which are conducted on paper <e> <s> its members are busy people <e>", "<cs> although it is not on my own front perhaps i may ask a question <e> <s> unlike the noble lord lord mishcon i do not know the answer <e> <s> i understood that the official referees wanted to become high court judges <e> <s> i understand though that that raises all sorts of issues <e> <s> however this amendment would leave them as circuit judges because section a of the supreme court act refers to circuit judges <e> <s> if that is so what is the point of the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words about this matter <e> <s> i have heard suggestions that we ought to be careful about disbarred barristers and solicitors who have been struck off <e> <s> i agree <e> <s> i hope that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor will also consider solicitors clerks who by statute have been made subject to an order by the law society that they never be employed by a solicitor <e> <s> that is a category at which i believe one should look <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to intervene in this discussion but i do so because of something that the noble lord lord benson said if i understood him correctly <e> <s> i understood him to say that if this amendment is not passed the idea will get about that the government are prepared to accept rules of conduct my note ran out at this point of lower standards or which did not include <e>", "<cs> i hasten to assure the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor that i am not in the least offended by the wording of the clause <e> <s> on the other hand the language could be reconsidered <e> <s> i prefer the use of the word shall instead of the word must <e> <s> that is the normal way in which statutory duties are communicated to those who must carry them out <e> <s> the word must is unusual but be that as it may <e>", "<cs> i have already expressed the view i think on second reading that i would not be subject to damages for breach of this duty if i breached it which i hoped i would not and that if i was subject to damages i should be looking to my noble and learned friend to persuade the treasury to stand behind me as he would in relation to any actions brought against me in my ordinary judicial capacity <e>", "<cs> i should like to register one short word of protest in response to the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> people reading his speech will think that it is an accepted fact that the judiciary and senior members of the two branches of the profession are dyed-in-the-wool reactionaries who have no new ideas <e> <s> they will think that it was for that reason that my noble and learned friend lord hailsham appointed a lay majority on the civil justice review <e> <s> i cannot speak for his reasons but that just is not true <e>", "<cs> i apologise if i misrepresented the situation <e> <s> i understood my noble and learned friend lord hailsham to say that nothing had resulted from the deliberations <e> <s> this was not a criticism of the members but perhaps of their persuasiveness <e> <s> i would not dream of casting the slightest aspersion in the direction of the noble lord lord mishcon <e>", "<cs> it is for my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor to deal with that point but perhaps i may make a small contribution from the point of view of the solicitors profession subject of course to correction by the noble lord lord mishcon <e>", "<cs> in reconsidering the matter i invite the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor to take into account representations which have been made during the past few days by the solicitors disciplinary tribunal <e> <s> it states that it needs powers over ex-solicitors <e> <s> following the keeping of the roll regulations it is now possible for a solicitor who has seen nemesis on the horizon to cease to be a solicitor overnight merely by failing to pay <e> <s> it is a convenient way of disappearing from the roll <e>", "<cs> may i mention in the briefest possible terms using this as a convenient peg that either the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor will have to make an order under the subsection or there must be express reference in the bill to the position of the visitors as the appellate body from the disciplinary tribunal of the council of the inns of court <e> <s> if i may declare an interest may i suggest that the same might be done for me as the appellate body in some respects from the solicitors disciplinary tribunal <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may mention a matter which is relevant to that point although perhaps neither that nor what i have to say is relevant to the amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord campbell asked what was meant by <e>", "<cs> no one who has been at the bar has other than the greatest possible respect for managing clerks as they were and legal executives as they now are <e> <s> i am sure that one way or another my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor wishes to preserve their jurisdiction <e> <s> in so far as anybody wishes that jurisdiction to be widened perhaps it is a matter that is better dealt with through the machinery that is established by the bill <e>", "<cs> while not adopting the phraseology of my noble and learned friend lord ackner i believe that the matter needs to be looked at very carefully in detail <e> <s> i should have thought that the advisory committee the lord chancellor and the designated judges were the people to do that <e> <s> i say that for this reason <e> <s> solicitors do not have rights of audience in all interlocutory proceedings in the supreme court <e> <s> so far as i am aware they certainly have no rights of audience in the court of appeal in relation to interlocutory proceedings <e>", "<cs> approximately once a month i sign a list of names the magic of which is that they <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor replies to that point i wish to refer to another issue as the noble and learned lord may wish to reply to them together <e> <s> i understood the noble and learned lord to say that the purpose of subsection was to make sure that no branch of the legal profession or i suppose licensed conveyancers made a rule preventing a barrister for example from acting as an employee of an authorised practitioner or acting on his behalf in other words facilitating the provision of conveyancing services by an authorised practitioner <e> <s> i have just been having a word with the chairman of the bar on this matter and i understand that what is troubling the bar is something quite different <e> <s> the bar wishes to be maintained as a referral profession that is a profession which does not accept instructions other than through another professional whereas it would appear that subsection a as drafted would prevent it prohibiting a member of the bar perhaps in private practice from carrying out conveyancing direct for members of the public with all kinds of complications in relation to the insurance cover provided by the bar and in relation to accounts <e> <s> perhaps i only speak for myself but i believe most members of the bar are quite incapable of keeping accounts which would satisfy the client account rules of the law society <e> <s> indeed it would be necessary to have client accounts and other horrors with which the bar is wholly unfamiliar <e>", "<cs> i explained that paragraph a was the problem <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor sits down can <e>", "<cs> i mean that the conveyancer is not necessarily an expert on ctt <e> <s> he is not necessarily a man of sufficient wisdom to say for example to someone of my age that you have to think twice before you put your house in the name of your grandchildren because you have to remember the position of your widow and other matters of that nature <e> <s> that is the kind of advice which a solicitor gives <e> <s> i doubt whether a licensed conveyancer can deal with these matters and not because he is less skilled <e> <s> i do not see why he should be considering these factors because they are not in his field <e>", "<cs> i only introduced the matter because i was asked <e> <s> it was not part of my argument <e>", "<cs> perhaps the matter can be looked at in a wider context <e> <s> ought a solicitor to be allowed to carry on any practice as a solicitor as he would be if he were using his qualifications to carry out conveyancing work without a practising certificate <e> <s> that will require the amendation of various sections in the solicitors act <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady phillips suggested that this clause should be welcomed by the practising legal profession <e> <s> for my part i have some passing doubts as to whether she is right <e>", "<cs> if i misunderstood the noble baroness i apologise but others may take that view <e> <s> however for my part i shall put that on one side as i regard it as a total irrelevance <e> <s> what really matters and what troubles me greatly is whether this clause is in the interests of the client as a consumer and whether it is in the interests of the efficient and proper administration of justice <e> <s> while i accept that there should be innovations in the administration of justice and in the way in which both branches of the legal profession are practised i have regretfully come to the conclusion that this measure is not in the interests of the client as a consumer <e> <s> furthermore it is wholly contrary to the interests of the proper and efficient administration of justice and therefore contravenes the general principle and the statutory objective which are set out in clause <e>", "<cs> before my noble and learned friend sits down in the interests of clarity will he consider making it clear on report that client includes lay client as well as professional client <e> <s> some people may think that it is the solicitor only who is their client in this context <e> <s> it is a point that may be worth making <e>", "<cs> there are times when i wonder whether this is not a private discussion between the noble lord lord mishcon and my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor into which two noble earls have butted unintentionally <e> <s> i am about to say something intentionally <e> <s> the reason i say something intentionally is because of the doctrine well known to lawyers as estoppel <e> <s> i do not wish it to be said hereafter that i cannot take the point because i did not take it at this stage <e> <s> so let me take it now and clearly <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will forgive me for returning to the fray just to mention this point <e> <s> under the existing rules of the law society i am not sure whether they are the existing rules or proposed rules at any rate they have been passed by the council of the law society and i have approved them to the best of my recollection it is not possible to have a director of an incorporated body of solicitors who is other than a solicitor <e> <s> that rule will be maintained after the bill is passed if it is passed and then the question will arise whether that rule is permissible <e> <s> that will have to go through the schedule procedure and the considerations that i have already mentioned will apply <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene purely in the hope of being helpful <e> <s> when i listen to the noble lord lord mishcon it strikes me that the problem he raises is essentially a transitional one <e> <s> there are now highly experienced solicitors a few of whom do a lot of work in the county court and who if they had been able to do so if this legislation had been in effect would have started off in the high court many years ago <e> <s> that is a rather different situation from that which will obtain in a few years time when should people in the capacity of fairly junior solicitors want to go in for high court litigation they will be building up the necessary qualification <e>", "<cs> i support the alternative of dealing with it in this bill after taking advice <e> <s> all experience shows that a missed legislative opportunity tends not to recur until much later than people expect when they postpone a matter <e>", "<cs> in the light of that helpful reply albeit not quite as helpful as i had hoped for i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> that matter does not arise now <e> <s> i do not move the amendment <e>", "<cs> subject to anything that my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor may say i should have thought that for this purpose claim would include counterclaim because it is the claim of the defendant <e> <s> it may be clearer to refer to counterclaim <e> <s> however i am quite sure that one cannot include defence because one cannot dismiss a defence for want of prosecution much as we should like to on many occasions <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene before the noble lord sits down <e> <s> of course that is right <e> <s> it is very often the litigants and not the practitioners who are responsible for the delay <e> <s> but the other reason that i wished to intervene is because i can speak for the civil division of the court of appeal <e> <s> i can tell the noble lord that if he had an urgent appeal i would put it on tomorrow morning no this morning or at whatever notice was required by the justice of the case <e> <s> however i think that he has done an injustice to my noble and learned friend the lord chief justice <e> <s> on the queens bench division the time intervals between trials and setting down are or can be shorter in appropriate cases than the example referred to of <e>", "<cs> i accept entirely what the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has said <e> <s> it is correct that the departmental committee wanted the law to be set out on the face of the bill and i should not dream of disagreeing with its expert view <e> <s> however the chairman of the committee said that in that capacity he did not feel free to consider what the high court rule should be and that must be right <e> <s> all he was considering was how to convey that to the arbitration fraternity whatever the rule <e> <s> it may well be that if he was free to consider the matter and apply his mind to it he would take the view that i have been putting forward <e>", "<cs> in dealing with this matter i hope that the noble and learned lord will also take into account the fact that many of these <e>", "<cs> if i may say so the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor is <e>", "<cs> i have a slight difficulty in that the copy of adamsons solicitors act does not include subsection <e> <s> however the point of principle which i understand is being raised by the noble lord lord mishcon is that where one is exercising the inherent jurisdiction of the high court in relation to a solicitor the court may well be acting on its own motion <e> <s> it may not be penalising the solicitor at the request of the other party <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor responds perhaps i may make what i hope is a helpful suggestion both to the noble lord lord mischon and to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor namely that we cannot possibly go down the road suggested that we are compensating for a judicial error <e> <s> if we once go down that road the consequences need no spelling out <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much hope that the noble lord lord mishcon will withdraw this amendment which i respectfully believe is wholly misconceived <e> <s> under the existing law the public law court as we sometimes refer to the crown office list dealing with judicial review is already subject as has been mentioned to the unique requirement that there must be leave before you can even begin the proceedings <e> <s> it is also subject to another requirement which is almost unique namely that subject to extensions of time the proceedings must be brought within three months of the complaint arising <e>", "<cs> my lords i appear to be the odd man out <e> <s> i do not oppose this <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the amendment <e> <s> i question whether there was a slip of the tongue when there was a mention of the rules committee <e> <s> is this not a primary power <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to keep the house for more than literally a minute or two <e> <s> however there is something i must say <e> <s> in committee the noble and learned lord said <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the classically difficult situations for a member of the bar concerns what he should do when he wishes to repudiate all his learned leaders arguments while still trying to sustain the same case <e> <s> i find myself in that position tonight <e> <s> i profoundly disagree with my noble and learned friend lord ackner that the composition of the advisory committee of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor should be designed in such a way as to inspire the confidence of the judiciary <e> <s> that is largely an irrelevance <e> <s> the composition of the advisory committee should be designed to give effect to the objects of the bill <e> <s> i repudiate totally the suggestion made by my noble and learned friend that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor in carrying out his duties in relation to the administration of justice is dependent upon the good will of the judiciary <e> <s> there is no question of good will or ill will <e> <s> we each have our respective parts to play and god willing we shall play them in partnership <e> <s> there is no question of good will or ill will <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to speak with the purpose of giving my noble and learned friend the opportunity to look at the book which is in his hand <e> <s> i am sure that he has been referred to section of the act under which the rules committee is itself appointed on the same basis <e>", "<cs> my lords may i inquire whether his learned junior also gets a vote <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down if that is the right expression am i out of order <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very much obliged to the house <e> <s> i totally agree that it should be the presiding judge who will be intimately in day-to-day contact with all sorts of circuit judges in different situations <e> <s> therefore we shall have two for the price of one <e> <s> one will also get the experience of a circuit judge <e> <s> i do not agree about the strings which my noble and learned friend has attached <e> <s> i am sure that the ordinary channels of communication will suffice to ensure that the best possible presiding judge is appointed <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have any difficulty in obtaining the general message from these words and i doubt whether in context anyone will have to do a nice as we would say the layman might take a different adjective piece of construction <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether the term probing amendment has a slightly different meaning on this occasion and whether i am being probed <e> <s> the suggestion that i would in some way use my powers as a designated judge to favour a separation of functions because i may personally believe in such a separation is misconceived <e>", "<cs> my lords unfortunately i do not have with me my copy of the solicitors act <e> <s> however i entertain some doubts as to whether there is a power in the council of the law society to make rules which are directly binding upon legal executives <e> <s> if one looks at the rules of conduct in this clause at line one finds that rules of conduct <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the discussion i raise a point which my noble and learned friend may wish to examine <e> <s> it is the question of whether the provision relates to the existing rules which are deemed to be approved <e> <s> the point had not occurred to me until i listened to the debate and recollected that consultation documents have been circulated in relation to the law societys rules in particular its publicity code <e> <s> i suppose that quite unreasonably the law society could make those rules before the bill comes into force subject to the concurrence of the master of the rolls <e> <s> the same would apply to the bar council <e> <s> after a quick glance it appeared that the bar would be deemed to have granted rights of audience to the extent that barristers would have those rights immediately before th december they would be deemed to have had their rules approved but not necessarily those which were in force on th december <e> <s> i raise the matter because suddenly it appeared to me to be a little odd <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most unwilling that there should be any misunderstanding or ambiguity as to what all this <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble lord is aware that it is not for the supreme court procedure committee to decide on rights of audience <e> <s> at present it is for the judges to decide <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> however while not wishing to be in the least bit critical i should like to make a drafting point and perhaps go a little further as a matter of principle than he has <e> <s> clause abrogates section of the solicitors act and that is necessary if solicitors are to be able to form multi-national partnerships with foreign lawyers <e> <s> but once you have abolished section i venture to suggest that what is required is not that the law society shall make rules permitting multi-disciplinary partnerships even subject to conditions <e> <s> once the section has been removed the society would not need to make any rules because you could do so in any event what matters is that the society shall make rules prohibiting multi-disciplinary partnerships unless these particular conditions which are of vital importance are satisfied <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may follow up that constructive suggestion <e> <s> as i understand it from my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor the intention of this power is to be able to fill gaps which appear on a very local scale and perhaps appear suddenly <e> <s> i would not have thought that the schedule procedure was very well designed to deal with that situation because the schedule procedure is designed to approve rules by in this case the law society <e> <s> it would seem hardly appropriate that the law society should pass a rule stating that solicitors should have a right of audience in the bodmin-truro crown court <e> <s> it is not the kind of thing with which the rules of the law society are normally designed to deal <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise only because i should not wish it to be thought that a serving judge had any different view from that expressed by my noble and learned friends lord hailsham and lord simon of glaisdale and by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> i have been in this job for many years and for the past seven or eight years i have been master of the rolls <e> <s> i regard it as of enormous importance that the senior judge should be the lord chancellor in order that he may span the gap which necessarily must exist to provide the necessary separation between the executive and the judiciary <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to make only one comment save to say that the present system works extremely well <e> <s> in talking to people i have heard it said that no doubt the lord chancellor consults the judges <e> <s> talking to them further i have the impression that they think the lord chancellor may perhaps have a word with a judge in the smoking room and then have a word with another judge <e> <s> it is believed that he consults the senior judges in that way <e> <s> i am sure that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor would not mind me saying that that is not the position <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer which the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor could also give is yes <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down perhaps i may commend to his consideration the fact that a coroner can be both legally qualified and medically qualified <e> <s> what is meant here is a legally qualified coroner not a coroner who is medically qualified <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor for bringing forward this amendment which as he said has been discussed with me <e> <s> i find it to be wholly admirable <e>", "<cs> my lords it must be my fault but i do not understand how this provision takes us away from the order in council <e> <s> i believe that section of the solicitors act is the section under which the council of the law society admits solicitors from commonwealth countries <e> <s> subsection which concerns the order in council is an essential qualifying subsection <e> <s> her <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only add that we should have struck it down years ago <e> <s> i have never inquired whether a report was prepared by a barrister a solicitor or anyone else <e> <s> however i know which are the good reports and which are not but that is a quite different matter <e>", "<cs> it was left out in the printing <e> <s> i have an erratum note <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in complete sympathy with the objectives of the <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down perhaps he can in order to assist me refer me to the part of the bill which permits co-option to the committee <e> <s> there are co-option powers to committees of the committee and to sub-committees but i thought there was no power to co-opt to the committee itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i was under the impression although i have not been able to check the facts that there was such a power in relation to the building societies ombudsman <e> <s> as i understand it he is able to make a building society publicise reasons for non-compliance <e> <s> i regard the position of a building society as being wholly different to that of an individual practitioner <e> <s> i believe that there is some publicity provision in the case of a local government commissioner but again that is quite different <e>", "<cs> my lords if i live long enough i suppose that i shall be a designated judge <e> <s> i might even be a designated judge of the kind that the noble lord lord mishcon had in mind <e> <s> however i do not myself see the measure working in quite that way <e>", "<cs> my lords it is important not to be bemused by the extent of the uplift which may well be a small percentage because as i see it there is a fundamental difference between a conditional fee agreement without uplift and one with uplift <e> <s> it is not entirely a question of the percentage <e> <s> perhaps i may illustrate that point <e> <s> barristers and i do not doubt solicitors have from time immemorial followed the same course as is followed by doctors of acting for their fellow professionals for nothing <e> <s> they may receive a small present or something of that kind <e> <s> however basically they are working for nothing <e>", "<cs> my lords i hate to disturb a happy note <e> <s> however i have a nasty feeling that my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor will say that this is already governed by part ii schedule in relation to rights of audience and the provision of litigation services <e> <s> i shall not have a right to reply so i shall point out now what i believe to be the fundamental fallacy of my noble and learned friends reply when he makes it <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that this is a convenient moment to endeavour to increase the happiness notably absent at the moment of the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> unless i have misunderstood the situation greatly where four designated judges and the lord chancellor stop work under the fourth schedule there is a residual designated judge who remains under the solicitors act doing his best to support the noble lords branch of the profession <e> <s> approval is required for any changes in the rules <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not detain the house for more than a minute or two <e> <s> i mean that <e> <s> i am driven to stand up by the sense of doom and gloom in which we are being enveloped <e>", "<cs> as a judge i have been brought up on a number of principles two of which i venture to think may be relevant to the debate today <e> <s> the first is that neither the judges nor the courts not i believe the citizens of this country are in the least concerned with the motives of government in introducing legislation or particular clauses in legislation <e> <s> the noble lord lord campbell of alloway seems to attach great importance to the governments motives in introducing the amendment <e> <s> for my part i know that the judges and i should have thought most people concerned would look simply at the wording of the statute as it emerges from parliament <e> <s> we are not concerned with the views of judges or even with great respect with the views of members of this chamber as individuals <e> <s> we are concerned with the will of parliament and that will be found purely in the legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise conscious that i am about to strike a slightly discordant note <e> <s> i must express my dismay at the bill and make it clear that in doing so i speak not as a serving judge but as the th master of the rolls <e> <s> that office came into existence in or about the th century when the master of the rolls was
