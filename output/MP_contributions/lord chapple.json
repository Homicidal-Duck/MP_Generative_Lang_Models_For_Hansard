["<cs> my lords this is the first time that i have addressed a forum from a position to which i was not elected <e> <s> it is rather an unusual experience for me in that i am not now answerable to an electorate or an executive or even to the general council <e> <s> however at the same time i have to accept full responsibility for any comments that i make although on this occasion in keeping with the traditions of this house on maiden speeches i shall not allow them full rein <e>", "<cs> my lords before i refer to the subject under discussion i should like to apologise to the house for my absence from the winding-up of the discussion on the airport inspectors report which was the occasion of my maiden speech <e> <s> your lordships have my assurance that i will not do it again <e> <s> i am very pleased on this occasion to be able to support the desire of the noble lord lord rochester to secure procedures by which union members views and wishes are more adequately represented by trade unions and their leadership for despite all protestations to the contrary such an improvement in union affairs would strengthen the arguments and demands put forward by trade union leaders <e> <s> at the same time it would give at least some respectability to the block vote <e> <s> of course i am aware from the enormous number of letters i have had from trade unionists from all parts of the trade union spectrum of the disquiet they feel about the ballots taking place on the political front as well as those for executive councils and principal officers <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want anyone to put words into my mouth <e> <s> is the noble lord suggesting that a single malpractice is all right <e>", "<cs> including timing my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first apologise for having missed the first four speeches of the debate <e>", "<cs> it was not my intention to speak in this debate primarily because i was not here when it began <e> <s> my other reason was that i did not want anything i said to embarrass my former colleagues on the opposition benches <e> <s> however the last contribution compels me to say that in principle in this matter the government are absolutely right <e> <s> there can be no doubt that trade union presidents and general secretaries have great power <e> <s> they have power over the appointment of officials <e> <s> they have power over the purse and the expenses that are paid to officials and over the pension rights of officials <e> <s> they have great power and that is a power that ought not to be bestowed upon them because they were appointed by an elected executive albeit elected by very dubious means anyway <e> <s> that will be put right by the rest of the bill <e>", "<cs> give the committee an example <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will listen to my experience on this matter since my union is the one that is generally mentioned and which is often dismissed by intellectuals in the labour movement as being a special case <e> <s> the way in which we conducted ballots after ending the ballot-rigging that took place in our union was to provide for the electoral reform society to send out ballot papers and to receive them <e> <s> in return the society receives any papers that are misdirected or sent to addresses which are unknown <e> <s> the union simply provides the electoral roll and pays for the ballot <e> <s> the society tells the union who has won but it sends out the ballot papers and collects them <e> <s> it works perfectly well but i do not believe that it works well with the scrutineers missing <e> <s> if the scrutineers do not send them out or get them back the system will not work <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say what is likely to happen to the individual in the case of a successful strike ballot when he returns to work and the employer says no there is no work for you because the majority of people are not here anyway <e> <s> i do not want you in i want you to stay out with the rest <e> <s> such a case has arisen on numerous occasions when there have been disputes <e>"]
