["<cs> my lords in rising to speak for the first time in your lordships house i must declare an interest in that i am a member of the stock exchange <e> <s> i hope that i can make a useful contribution to this afternoons debate <e> <s> i must say straight away that i am in favour of the bill as i think are the <e>", "<cs> my lords the british railways board proposes to invest million at fourth quarter prices in electrifying the east coast main line and in new locomotives and rolling stock for the electrified services <e> <s> the alternative of renewal of the diesel stock would have cost million <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport gave his consent to this expenditure on th july <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may thank my noble friend for his very kind words <e> <s> a full electrified service to newcastle and edinburgh is planned by british rail from may <e> <s> services to leeds are planned to start in and shorter distance services to huntingdon and peterborough in <e> <s> british rail is determined to minimise the effects on its customers of electrification construction work and proposes to do per cent <e> <s> of the work under cover of routine track possessions for engineering and maintenance which would have been necessary in any event <e> <s> it is planning on the basis that at worst and for the longest trips journey times should be extended by no more than eight minutes during the construction phase <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his kind words <e> <s> the proposal at the moment is that the electrification should extend to leeds but it is for british rail to judge whether investment in such electrification would be justified <e> <s> it does not propose further electrification except to leeds at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his kind words <e> <s> the construction of the electrification scheme should i hope produce between and new jobs <e> <s> on the question of future electrification plans the government are ready to approve any worthwhile investment offering a sound prospect for improving the financial performance of the railway <e> <s> however it is for british rail to decide on its own investment priorities and to judge whether to bring forward proposals <e> <s> the only other electrification scheme being looked at at the moment is a small one to run electrified freight services through north london linking the already electrified west coast main line with the haven ports and terminals in north-east london and essex <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his question <e> <s> i do not have the answer at the moment but perhaps i may write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that question rather falls outside the scope of the question on the order paper <e> <s> if the noble lord would like to put down a question no doubt we can provide an answer <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments decision was based on a detailed and rigorous appraisal which showed the scheme to be justified on its financial merits <e> <s> it should achieve a real return of per cent <e> <s> i cannot say as to any precise productivity deals <e>", "<cs> my lords the costs will indeed be met from british rails own funds but cost savings and revenue benefits will more than outweigh the capital costs <e> <s> there is therefore no case for separate or special funding by the government and british rail has not asked for it <e> <s> on the question of future investment british rail has invested almost billion at todays prices since plus another million a year on continuous welded rail <e> <s> british rail intends to invest in excess of that amount in the next five years <e>", "<cs> my lords the government agree that there should be severe penalties for those who are guilty of recklessly killing and injuring others on our roads <e> <s> we have no present plans to change this particular law but my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport has been giving further thought to the subject of road traffic law generally and hopes to make an announcement shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords the average disqualification is in fact of three years <e> <s> the last available figures were those for during which people were convicted of causing death by reckless driving <e> <s> the vast majority of those people were disqualified per cent <e> <s> of them for periods of three years and over <e> <s> nearly half those convicted were also given prison sentences mostly of up to months but in some cases longer <e>", "<cs> my lords i would agree <e> <s> only the courts have access to all the relevant facts of a particular case <e> <s> they will therefore be in the best position to make judgments appropriate to those facts <e> <s> the magistrates association does issue to benches its own suggestions on appropriate sentences for magistrates courts and the lord chief justice has <e>", "<cs> my lords i should very much like to thank the noble lord lord teviot for introducing this question <e> <s> i welcome this opportunity to debate the governments proposals on buses which were set out in the white paper published in july <e> <s> it is a subject to which i do not claim to bring the personal knowledge which my noble friend lord teviot and several other noble lords have on this subject <e> <s> nevertheless in the short time i have held my present responsibilities i have come to recognise the great importance of our proposals particularly to the many millions of people in both urban and rural areas who use this form of public transport <e> <s> as the white paper said britain needs good bus services <e> <s> over per cent <e> <s> of all journeys are made by bus and three-quarters of those journeys are for essential purposes work school business and shopping <e> <s> our aim is to set the industry free so that it can give a better service to the passenger and better value for money to the ratepayer and taxpayer <e> <s> we are currently considering responses to the white paper and consulting widely on the details of our proposals on the basis of seven consultation documents <e> <s> we intend to bring forward legislation at the earliest opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point that the noble lord has made <e> <s> i think that i may have a reply to it when i come to my more detailed answers <e> <s> the effect of removing road service licensing will give the bus industry its head <e> <s> it will allow operators to test the market by seeing whether people want different services and at what price <e> <s> it will allow operators to show what they can really do <e> <s> there will be fare reductions on well-used services and passengers can expect more frequent buses on busy routes <e> <s> it will introduce the competitive spur to efficiency and lead to innovation <e> <s> the bus industry will begin to recapture some of the traffic which has been drifting away to other forms of transport <e> <s> at long last the best routes will be cultivated and developed <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to ask the noble lord to wait and see the bill <e> <s> all we have at present is the white paper and as your lordships know there is a considerable amount of consultation still going on <e>", "<cs> my lords on th december last year my noble friend lord lucas announced the governments aim that british airways should as far as possible improve its balance sheet through its own efforts <e> <s> since then the airline has endeavoured to meet the governments objective with considerable success it has made no recent proposals to the government for the reduction of outstanding loans <e>", "<cs> my lords i know of no other airline in the private sector in this country which has asked for money to write off its debts <e>", "<cs> the only money that the government have given to british airways in the last years has been million of public dividend capital <e> <s> this has been an investment not a subsidy and british airways has paid the government million of dividends over the years <e> <s> in parliament sanctioned the write-off of million being the inrecoverable costs of concorde but the remaining million now forms the equity capital of british airways which the government still own and which they plan to sell at a profit on flotation next year <e>", "<cs> my lords british airways half yearly accounts are due to be published towards the end of november <e> <s> after that time it will be decided whether it is necessary to take action regarding the restructuring of british airways debts <e> <s> i cannot at present say whether or not this will be necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords should it be necessary to have any reconstruction of british airways debt that reconstruction would obviously be <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his question <e> <s> he has put the matter very much better than i possibly could <e>", "<cs> i will indeed my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a point on which i do not think i wish to comment at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not agree with the noble lord that we are giving away british airways <e>", "<cs> my lords i must congratulate the noble lord lord kings norton and his colleagues and particularly my noble friends the duke of portland and lord teviot and the noble lord lord underhill who have spoken today for the splendid way they have got to grips with this complicated subject <e> <s> when i sat down to attempt the same at the weekend i appreciated all the hard work which must have gone into the report <e> <s> the committee have managed to cut through the jargon and have produced conclusions which have the ring of common sense about them <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall do my best to answer those questions <e> <s> the first one i think is reasonably simple <e> <s> it is only the asbestos element an unbonded asbestos element which we are talking about and not any other part of the machine <e> <s> secondly i understand the subsection in question to be section <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments policy is to stress to the shipping industry the need to avoid disposal of garbage at sea and to recommend voluntary compliance with the provisions of annex v of the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships known as marpol <e> <s> it is our policy also to seek at the international maritime organisation to amend the content of annex v to a form more acceptable to the united kingdom so as to enable the united kingdom to ratify this annex at the earliest possible time <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very concerned with the disposal of garbage at sea <e> <s> we admire the work that the keep britain tidy group does <e> <s> the reason that we have not ratified annex v is that the problems of garbage disposal for operators of large cruise liners result from a shortage of shore reception facilities in potential special areas abroad <e>", "<cs> my lords we are well aware that it is not only the north sea and the english channel that are affected by this practice <e> <s> as to the noble lords point about disposal it is garbage we are talking about at this moment <e> <s> the noble lord may well be referring to the disposal of other items such as containers and drums of dangerous chemicals <e> <s> these are covered by another annex of marpol annex iii <e> <s> already per cent <e> <s> of the activities covered in that annex are against the law in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i have said that we hope to agree to the annex of the international convention as soon as possible when we get the amendments which we are looking for to protect our own shipping industry when they go to other parts of the world where the facilities are not as good as they are in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that we will <e> <s> i come back to the point that until other parts of the world can produce the shore reception facilities that our liners would require this would refer particularly to the special areas such as the mediterranean we do not want to jeopardise our trade until we can get those amendments through <e> <s> we are working for that at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords as a lover of oysters i welcome my noble friends remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i was not aware that the deadline was th december <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that we cannot always do something about it <e> <s> what we can do is to try to do the best we can <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of this <e> <s> even if we signed annex v we would only be able to get at shipping either under our own flag or which called in at our ports <e>", "<cs> my lords recently published figures show that fatal and serious injuries to front-seat occupants of cars and light vans in the first six months of were per cent <e> <s> fewer than in the first six months of <e> <s> the department will continue to publish information throughout the three-year period of the regulations <e> <s> the edition of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that my noble friend has got me there <e> <s> i am not aware of any progress being made in the uniformity of fastenings or of what the eec have said <e> <s> if i may i shall write to my noble friend when i get this information <e>", "<cs> my lords in regard to rear seat-belts we are awaiting the report from the select committee on road safety which is expected in mid-december about the compulsory fitting of rear seat-belts <e> <s> however we have no plans at the moment to extend compulsory wearing to rear seat-belts <e>", "<cs> my lords we are pleased that as far as we know the observance is still per cent <e> <s> in there were prosecutions <e> <s> i gather that nearly all if not all of them arose from stopping for another offence at the same time <e>", "<cs> no my lords i would not agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no statistics with me <e> <s> this will be a subject in the report when it is published but at this stage we do not believe that there is any significant number that could be attributed to wearing seat-belts <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i can give the second assurance the noble lord is requiring <e> <s> i will certainly give the assurance that we shall look at the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly bear in mind the noble lords remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may be allowed to give the governments view briefly <e> <s> we of course share the general concern for the unemployed felt on all sides of the house but we do not believe that the measures of the kind proposed in that clause of the bill represent the most sensible or effective way of coming to their assistance <e> <s> on the contrary we believe that by increasing the burden that subsidies impose on the ratepayer and the taxpayer they are more likely to inhibit the economic growth which represents the best hope for reducing present levels of unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport after consulting widely with all sections of industry laid regulations on th october <e> <s> these are now before your lordships house <e> <s> they make mandatory the fitting of spray-reducing equipment to heavy lorries <e> <s> these regulations would come into effect progressively from st may starting with new trailers followed by new motor vehicles and existing heavy trailers <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his kind words <e> <s> at the moment visiting vehicles are exempt through the geneva and vienna conventions <e> <s> however there is no european community directive or regulation on this matter <e> <s> we hope that the eec will follow our lead and that harmonisation will be brought about based on our standard <e>", "<cs> my lords at the moment it is not proposed that the regulations should cover coaches <e> <s> however i shall certainly draw the noble lords remarks to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said they are exempt through the geneva and vienna conventions <e> <s> i am afraid that i am not aware of how we could go about cancelling either of those exemptions <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the local government supplementary grants for transport purposes specified descriptions order which was laid before your lordships house on nd october be approved <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try to answer as many points as i can which have been raised during the debate <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill queried the reduction in the percentages of tsg from per cent <e> <s> in to percent in and now to per cent <e> <s> in fact the present tsg system was on all accepted expenditure above a <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate what the noble lord says but we believe that they should be able to do so under the block grant <e> <s> all they are doing is getting the money from a different source <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot make a definite promise <e> <s> all i can say is that under the present plans overall the amount of money will remain the same <e> <s> obviously i cannot at the moment give any assurance for the future <e> <s> i do not think the noble lord would expect me to be able to do so at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said we believe that they should have to find the money from their block grant <e> <s> i cannot give any assurance about what we might or might not do if the case which the noble lord mentioned arose <e> <s> we hope that they will find the money from their block grant <e>", "<cs> my lords major repairs and renewals to lifts and escalators in london underground stations are carried out by contractors selected by competitive tender by london regional transport <e> <s> i understand that there are currently nine lifts and nine escalators out of service while being replaced <e> <s> the longest periods out of service on current contracts are about two years for lifts and months for an escalator <e>", "<cs> my lords we must understand that there are often difficulties of access to the equipment and problems arising from the need to keep the stations open <e> <s> in some cases special building work is needed and the replacement with modern machines often requires extensive modernisation of the existing buildings <e> <s> i am sure that london regional transport try to do these things or to get the contractors to do them as quickly as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall indeed pass on that observation <e> <s> in fact i thought that that was normally the case <e>", "<cs> my lords the problems of competitive tendering in this field are that the level of competition is limited because of the number of firms interested in tendering for this highly specialised work in often restricted site conditions <e> <s> we do not believe that it is a problem of finance <e> <s> the problems are technical not financial <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly draw my noble friends question to the attention of lrt <e>", "<cs> my lords again i shall certainly draw my noble friends question to the attention of lrt <e>", "<cs> my lords i must again draw my noble friends question to the attention of london regional transport <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not have the details of individual stations with me here at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords a full inquiry is taking place into the oxford circus fire <e> <s> asbestos was contained in the roof and debris from the ceiling material was found to contain traces of white asbestos <e>", "<cs> my lords that may well be the case but it is not possible to install lifts in all the stations where escalators are already in use <e>", "<cs> my lords we would not agree that lrt should have been left with the glc <e> <s> however again i shall draw what is turning into a debate to the attention of lrt <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether it would be possible to give individual figures for each station <e> <s> i have said in my original answer that the longest period out of service was two years for a lift and months for an escalator <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that it will be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord foot has made clear this debate is about a bypass proposed for the town of okehampton and two orders made by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport following a decision made jointly by him and by the secretary of state for the environment <e> <s> it may be helpful if i take a little of your lordships time to explain some of the background <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should now like to try to attempt to deal with some of the points that have been raised although i think noble lords will agree that most of the questions are not for me but for deliberation in the future by the joint committee <e> <s> but i must take up one or two points <e> <s> the noble lords lord melchett and lord carmichael mentioned that up to trees might be felled <e> <s> it was made quite clear at the inquiry and it remains the case that the department intends to plant at least five times as many new trees along the line of the route if the road is built <e> <s> the noble lord lord melchett also mentioned the subject of bluebell woods and drew attention to the terms of the trust deed for bluebell wood <e> <s> but i should like to repeat that the owners of bluebell wood the parish council of okehampton hamlets are responsible for administering that deed <e> <s> they have carefully weighed the pros and cons and have concluded that the best interests of the people of okehampton are best served by allowing the bypass to be built through that area rather than through any of the alternatives <e>", "<cs> my lords i can say that we have no present intention of changing this <e> <s> but as i said i cannot commit myself to a hypothetical case which might arise in the future <e> <s> we listened with interest to the speeches of the noble earl lord iddesleigh and my noble friend lord clinton and to their strongly held and well-raised views <e> <s> i think we have had a very interesting debate and i should like to take this opportunity to wish the joint committee well in its deliberations <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand from the company that up to early november orders worth nearly million had been received for the road runner <e>", "<cs> my lords given the importance of the sector this vehicle is as important to leyland vehicles as were the metro and the maestro to austin rover <e> <s> noble lords will be aware of the improvement within austin rover in the last few years <e> <s> on the question of exports they have as yet been minimal <e> <s> production is concentrated for the moment on the united kingdom market <e> <s> however the vehicles first major public showing was at the paris show and leyland vehicles hoped that the road runner would sell well on the continent <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the whole house would wish british leyland which is after all a nationalised industry well and wish it success in promoting this new product <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects on behalf of my noble friend lord gowrie i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement on banking supervision which is being made in another place by my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank both noble lords for receiving the statement <e> <s> regarding the questions of the noble lord lord stoddart as to why we should need to have the review now the chancellor has considered the issues and thinks that it is sensible to make a statement <e> <s> there are no sinister reasons whatsoever for this <e> <s> there is no disagreement whatsoever between the bank and the treasury <e> <s> the banking act has only been in force since so there have been no grounds for an earlier review <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg your lordships pardon <e> <s> this was a decision made by the governor of the bank not by the government <e> <s> it is however the governments view that the main part of johnson mattheys business was viable and that the consequences of the failure would have spread well beyond johnson matthey itself <e> <s> i should say that it is the banks money being used not government money in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords it is possible that the bank might have to cut its dividends to the treasury but this is the bank of englands money <e> <s> as i have said the governor informed the chancellor <e> <s> that is all that he is obliged to do <e> <s> it is the governor <e>", "<cs> my lords that undertaking i think i can definitely give <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord walston has said in his very lucid speech this is the second time this year that he has introduced this bill <e> <s> the first time it was welcomed on behalf of the government by my noble friend lord lucas of chilworth and this task has now fallen to me <e> <s> in fact i cannot improve on the noble lords statement of the case for this bill <e> <s> it is a small but useful measure which will clarify a rather uncertain area of the law and in circumstances which we hope will occur very rarely if at all it could be instrumental in preventing a disaster <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have no plans to change their accounting systems with regard to the sale of public assets <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly regard the sale of british telecom as an outstanding success on the part of the privatisation programme <e> <s> however in accordance with the consolidated fund act receipts are not hypothecated for specific purposes <e> <s> this allows the receipts to be used in accordance with the governments overall economic policy and gives parliament greater control over the governments expenditure plans <e> <s> sales of physical and financial assets have always been treated as negative public expenditure <e> <s> in nearly all cases acquisitions of <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with my noble friend <e> <s> capital expenditure by the government has risen every year in constant terms it is slightly up <e> <s> moreover taking private and public capital expenditure together in we expect to achieve a post-war record and we expect to do better than that in <e>", "<cs> my lords i presume that the noble lord is referring to the sale of british telecom <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said we were delighted by the privatisation of british telecom <e> <s> in fact we were taken by surprise to some extent by its success <e> <s> it is obvious with the benefit of hindsight that it might have been possible to sell it for a little bit more <e> <s> however we have now achieved a record number of individual shareholders <e> <s> more than million people applied for these shares which was considerably more than the number for which we had hoped <e> <s> we regard it as very good that share-ownership should be increased by such a massive extent in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me to speculate on how many of the million people who applied for british telecom shares will or will not sell them over the next six months <e> <s> nor will it be a matter for us <e> <s> it will be a matter for british telecom <e> <s> as regards the sale of assets we are behaving no differently from how the previous government of which the noble lord was a member behaved in in their first privatisation exercise <e>", "<cs> my lords not without notice <e> <s> however i think that there have been several issues on the stock exchange which have doubled very quickly but they have not been privatisation issues <e>", "<cs> my lords we were extremely confident in the advice that we were given <e> <s> we chose the advisers who we thought were the best people to advise us <e>", "<cs> my lords we have asked both british rail and london regional transport to maintain or improve service standards in and around london at lower cost to the taxpayer <e> <s> we stand ready to approve any worthwhile investment project to this end <e> <s> at the same time the liberalisation of coach licensing has improved the range of choice for many commuters <e>", "<cs> my lords i have indeed <e> <s> the new card is being introduced on th january <e> <s> it will give access to british rail and lrt services at a modest premium over the fares charged by either <e> <s> people living outside greater london up to about miles from the centre will be able to buy a combined british rail season ticket and capital card <e> <s> this will give them unlimited access to british rail and lrt services within greater london plus travel by british rail between home and the greater london boundary <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure what should have been discussed with the passengers committee or the local authorities <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord could put me right <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the noble lord an assurance that they were discussed <e> <s> i have not got that information on me <e> <s> i shall write to the noble lord if i may <e>", "<cs> my lords british rail have stated that they want to do better and we welcome that <e> <s> they have set themselves quality of service targets covering cancellations punctuality and cleanliness <e> <s> as regards the noble lords first supplementary about not smoking i shall certainly draw his remarks to the attention of the british rail board <e> <s> on the question of victoria station i think i shall have to do the same <e>", "<cs> my lords this will be a matter about which i am sure british rail will be aware when they meet as they hope to the quality of service targets <e>", "<cs> my lords if i understood the noble lord correctly i think that that would be a matter for the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his first remark <e> <s> i cannot give him a figure on the number of drivers being recruited annually <e> <s> i would however say that in order to improve services on the southern region my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary of state for transport yesterday announced a new million re-signalling scheme for the waterloo area <e> <s> i hope that that will assist him in some way <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank both the noble lord lord underhill and my noble friend lord campbell of croy for their general support of these motions <e> <s> perhaps i may deal with just four points which were raised <e> <s> both the noble lord lord underhill and my noble friend lord campbell of croy wondered whether the regulations would help to arrest the decline of the british fleet <e> <s> indeed much of the british fleets earnings come from cross-trading on routes serving third countries <e> <s> one of the key steps which the government can take in contrast to the steps which the industry might take is to keep the shipping markets open to british lines <e> <s> the code together with the brussels package represents a very significant development in keeping these cross-trades open <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name <e>", "<cs> my lords such a direction would not be appropriate <e> <s> the london regional transport act requires london regional transport to make available comprehensive information about their affairs <e> <s> they have a duty to prepare consult upon and publish a three-yearly statement of strategy the first of which is due by the end of june this year <e> <s> they are required to publish an annual business plan the plan for was published last december and the noble lord has no doubt seen it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord will find in the business plan much of the information for which he is asking certainly that relating to passenger miles and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords the annual business plan is freely available to anybody who wants to look at it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend lord bessborough for initiating this most interesting debate this evening <e> <s> as he has said he is half english and half french so he has a unique interest in this matter having so to speak <e> <s> a foot on both sides of the channel <e> <s> i have listened with enormous interest to the wide range of comment and opinion expressed this evening <e> <s> there is also considerable public interest in the question of a cross-channel link <e> <s> i am sure that the many and varied points of view we have heard today reflect something of that wider interest throughout the country <e> <s> with the exception of my noble friend lord molson all those who have spoken have been in favour of some kind of link <e>", "<cs> my lords i am coming to that in due course <e> <s> any scheme accepted will have to be a fully private sector enterprise and before we accept it we shall need to be convinced that it is financially robust and commercially sound <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until half-past eight <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord lucas of chilworth i beg to move the motion standing in his name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords this was considered before the coin was selected <e> <s> unfortunately additions to make the coin more yellow also reduce its tarnish resistance <e>", "<cs> i must admit my lords that that is the first i have seen of the australian coinage including the australian golden dollar <e> <s> the reason why we chose this mix of alloys to make the coin and this was very carefully considered before the choice was made was that unlike the old threepenny bit which was more yellow in colour the new coin would not tarnish <e> <s> with handling over a period of time the coin will take on a more matt greenish-yellow colour <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware that we had an interesting debate during which i was present thoughout <e> <s> however i must draw the noble viscounts attention to the question on the order paper which is about the colour of the coin <e>", "<cs> my lords that is another question altogether <e> <s> i shall certainly draw the attention of my right honourable friend to that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord would remind me of the point of his first supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot reconsider my answer <e> <s> as i said a great deal of consideration went into choosing the material for the new coin and i hope that i have given an explanation of why that choice was made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i do not know exactly what the greenish-yellow colour that the coin will take on in time will look like until it comes about <e> <s> as regards the problems of the blind i understand that before the coin was introduced organisations for the blind were fully consulted and the size thickness and shape of the coin should help them <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of those two instances <e> <s> all i can say is that the material that is being used is extremely difficult to forge <e> <s> certainly any vending machine will readily reject a fake <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said to my noble friend before it was the first i had seen of the australian dollar <e>", "<cs> my lords the details of these arrangements are the responsibility of london regional transport <e> <s> having seen them for myself i am reasonably satisfied that they are

getting off <e> <s> i also understand that lrt encourage such passengers to use the air-bus services which allow time for luggage to be unloaded at the destination <e>", "<cs> my lords that is another

reduction in the provision of bus services but only where the supply has to meet the demand <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i know no reductions in bus services have been caused for that reason <e> <s> i can perhaps remind the noble lord that i am answering an unstarred question from my noble friend lord belhaven and stenton on precisely that subject tomorrow evening <e>", "<cs> my lords the reasons

noble lord can argue that if the glc makes a surplus of million on the one hand and has liabilities of million on the other it is not going to be million worse off <e> <s> however various noble lords have argued that the bill effectively taxes ratepayers because any cash surplus carried forward to will go to reduce the exchequer contribution for under the one-third/two-thirds split as specified in

contribution to lrts grant for at one-third of the total <e> <s> the exchequer contribution was fixed at million which is more than one-third of the total grants of million <e> <s> the exchequer contribution was derived using the same principles as are applied to the calculation of exchequer grant towards the cost of local authority services generally on the basis of lrts projected public

our proceedings on this bill until oclock <e> <s> i beg to move that consideration on report be adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport <e> <s> the statement reads as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lords lord carmichael of kelvingrove and lord taylor of gryfe for their reception of the statement <e> <s> i shall deal with their questions as best i can <e> <s> the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove mentioned the land conceded referred to in paragraph <e> <s> this means that it would be the subject of a concession agreement it would not simply mean given <e> <s> it is a precise use of the word conceded i am told <e> <s> the noble lord also <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his question <e> <s> i make it absolutely clear that it will be up to the promoters to decide whether they wish to include a rail link in their proposals and therefore it will be up to the promoters and british rail to negotiate the extent of british rails involvement <e> <s> that would be subject to british rails involvement being on a strictly commercial basis and applying the tests which we already do to british rails investment programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether or not to be tempted into giving an estimate of when building could start <e> <s> as i have said proposals are to be completed by st october with the end of the year for our decision <e> <s> there is then the question of legislation which as i have mentioned would have to pass through both houses <e> <s> the french of course will have their own legislation <e> <s> perhaps it will be in two years from now <e> <s> as regards completion of the three schemes which one has heard have been proposed i think the shortest construction period is about four-and-a-half years and another scheme would take about seven years to complete <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord carmichael took note of the remarks of the noble lord lord howie of troon regarding the construction industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord somers <e> <s> that would be a problem but it is of course for the promoters to decide how to cope with it <e>", "<cs> my lords as to the noble lords first point i think that it is worth quoting from the proposals regarding competition and market freedom <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord <e> <s> i take note of what he says about hybrid bills <e> <s> i do not think that there is much that i can say at the moment that might speed the legislation through parliament other than to record the good will on the whole which the statement has received in this house <e> <s> i hope that that will help its progress <e> <s> i have i hope already covered the point about british rail <e> <s> as i say it is for the promoters to decide whether to include a rail link <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend that the only guarantees that the government would give would be of a political nature there would be none of a financial nature <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft merchant shipping cargo ship construction and survey regulations amendment regulations laid before the house on th february be approved <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord carmichael for his reception of these measures <e> <s> i think that the answer to this question is yes but if i find that that is not so i shall certainly write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords collaboration in the electronics industry is primarily a matter for the companies themselves <e> <s> however the government acknowledge that they have a role in creating the right environment <e> <s> this is being achieved through the harmonisation of international technical standards and through effects to create a truly single market within the european community <e> <s> the government are also promoting research and development primarily through the esprit programme which being based on joint research activities will also encourage collaboration <e>", "<cs> my lords brite is a collaborative programme aimed at introducing new technologies into traditional industries <e> <s> one hundred and twenty-five million ecu about million has been allocated for its four years life of which the united kingdom contribution will be per cent <e> <s> the first call for proposals has just been made <e> <s> we have conducted seminars and used the technical press and direct-mail shops to publicise it <e> <s> to judge from the expressions of interest made last year we have high hopes for the participation of united kingdom companies <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his question <e> <s> i am aware of the figures to which he refers <e> <s> they should be interpreted with care because they are not directly comparable <e> <s> for instance they differ in their coverage of expenditure by government departments for defence r d and telecommunications <e> <s> they vary in their coverage of support for regional investment and inward investment <e> <s> they omit expenditure on programmes of the european community and some of the assistance is of a type that this government would not wish to offer <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards consultations the esprit programme is a joint programme between industry government and the european governments as is the alvey programme between industry and government and the universities <e> <s> regarding the development of the internal market it is vital that we get as soon as possible the advantage which the united states and japan have of a large domestic market <e> <s> we believe that european companies also should have that advantage <e> <s> the government are taking every opportunity to press for the reduction in checks and formalities at frontiers for the freedom to provide services and for the opening up of markets through open tendering <e> <s> there is a number of different fields in which these programmes are taking place <e> <s> for example the esprit programme is in microelectronics advanced information processing software technology office systems and computer integrated manufacture <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord nathan for initiating what has been a most interesting and important debate on a very topical subject <e> <s> i am grateful also to the members of sub-committee g of the select committee on the european communities for all their work <e> <s> the report assembles a great deal of up-to-date <e>", "<cs> my lords coaches and heavy lorries are already subject to a number of local authority traffic regulations in london <e> <s> urgent consideration is being given with the authorities concerned as to the scope for action over increased volumes of coaches in london this summer <e>", "<cs> my lords we are of course concerned <e> <s> that is why we are examining the situation to see how we might assist the authorities more directly in resolving the problems <e>", "<cs> my lords the problem is the difficulty in finding places in which to park these coaches in london when they have disgorged their tourists <e> <s> i am sure that noble lords will agree that the tourist industry is of great importance to london and the economy and that we should not try to prevent tourists from coming here <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of the concern of the noble lord lord ezra for the ebury street area and victoria coach station <e> <s> i was not aware that the smoke was in excess of the limits allowed <e> <s> i can say that it is primarily a matter for the glc which is the traffic authority and of course westminster city council <e> <s> however i hope that that will not long remain so <e> <s> i would say that i believe that there are certain plans in hand which might alleviate the situation in ebury street <e>", "<cs> certainly not my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords it is early days at the moment <e> <s> the noble lord may well be aware that the glc is currently conducting its own investigation and i believe submissions have to be in by st march <e> <s> we shall be interested to see the conclusions <e> <s> as for our own investigations we are discussing the situation with the local authorities concerned the operators and so forth <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord may be aware there is already a ban in certain areas of central london on lorries of over feet and i believe that the area is bounded by vauxhall blackfriars kings cross and the edgware road for those not requiring access to central london <e> <s> as to larger lorries transferring their loads to smaller lorries i am not sure that that would have the desired effect as it would result in more lorries and not fewer <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise if my answer to the supplementary question of the noble lord lord ezra was unsatisfactory <e> <s> i shall look into the question which he has raised and see what conclusions we come to <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the problems of lorries using london as through traffic will be very considerably alleviated when the m is completed <e> <s> in regard to tourist coaches etc <e> <s> i do not think there will be any difference <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of the particular matter to which the noble baroness refers <e> <s> i would point out that under the london regional transport act licences for local excursions and tours can be refused if the traffic commissioners consider that the proposed stopping places would be prejudicial to the safety or convenience of the public <e> <s> i shall draw the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend does indeed take the lead in coordinating the governments maritime policies <e> <s> in his answer to the question from the honourable member for rugby and kenilworth on th march my right honourable friend made an extensive reference to the action which the government have taken in pursuing their shipping policy <e> <s> the necessary constraints on the length of his answer did not permit him to detail more of the work that the department has undertaken in this and other related areas <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friends answer certainly did not restrict itself only to privatisation <e> <s> i refer the noble lord to the answer in col of th march <e> <s> i do not wish to waste the time of your lordships by reading it out but basically it gives a summary of what we have done in the world shipping markets to open them to competition and so on <e> <s> in fact it does not mention privatisation as such <e>", "<cs> my lords it is quite wrong to say that my right honourable friend did not mention the maritime policy in his written reply to which i have just referred <e> <s> perhaps i may recap on what he said <e> <s> the main aims of our policy are to secure the widest and fairest world-wide market for british shipping to compete in to fight protectionism subsidy noncommercial competition and unsafe vessels in international and cabotage trades and to reduce the burden of external costs and marine regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords co-ordination can and does take place and the problems are not of government machinery but of international economic pressures and distortion of shipping and shipbuilding markets <e> <s> with regard to naming any specific act of co-ordination i could mention the control of pollution for instance where we operate very closely with the relevant department there <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the blue ensign in fact i think most of our merchant shipping flies the red ensign <e> <s> the reasons for the decline in the fleet i hope i covered in answer to a question asked by the noble lord lord grimond in january of this year <e> <s> there are many different reasons for that notably a change in patterns of trade and very competitive rates in the bulk trades particularly the wet bulk trade <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with other noble lords in thanking my noble friend for raising this topic tonight <e> <s> we have heard some interesting excellent and very well-informed speeches which have ranged over many different aspects of the subject <e> <s> the breadth of the debate shows how building societies now touch many corners of our national life <e> <s> the governments proposals for new legislation are not merely of narrow concern to the building society movement only the issues they raise are of considerable importance to many people in many walks of life <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i got it wrong but i thought i was responding to what was in the green paper and the government in the green paper would wish to restrict them to broking and not underwriting <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government have already considered this matter <e> <s> a trade mission organised by the scottish council development and industry intends to visit the soviet union from th to th september this year <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland plans to lead the mission together with the president of the council the noble lord lord clydesmuir <e> <s> approximately company representatives are being invited to participate in the mission <e>", "<cs> my lords we are actively trying to promote trade with russia <e> <s> indeed the visit by mr gorbachev in december indicated that he would like to see trade with russia increased by to per cent <e> <s> the possibility of a visit to the soviet union during by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for trade and industry or my right honourable friend the minister for trade is under consideration <e> <s> however the timing of such a visit will need careful consideration in the light of the visit by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland and other ministerial visits in both directions this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the balance of trade but as i have said we cannot send everybody at once <e> <s> however there are other things happening <e> <s> my right honourable friend the minister for trade has invited the soviet minister for the coal industry mr bratchenko to visit this country and he has indicated that he wishes to take up this invitation in june <e> <s> an invitation has also been extended to the minister for the chemical industry mr listov and we hope that he will take up that invitation very soon <e> <s> of course there is also the thirteenth session of the british-soviet joint mission which will be held in london in the first week of june <e>", "<cs> my lords the cultural aspect is rather outside the question and is something about which i know very little <e> <s> however as i have said i hope that we shall do all we can on the trade side <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i said that the possibility of a visit during this year is under consideration <e> <s> however there are a number of other missions both ways taking place and we must take them into consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords from the answers which i have given so far i had hoped to show that it was pretty high on our agenda <e> <s> we must wish all the british companies who take part in these missions both ways the utmost success in securing business <e>", "<cs> all these amendments address the same or similar points <e> <s> in essence they cover two lines of argument <e> <s> the first is whether certain traffic and highways functions require a london or countrywide body whether it is a residuary body or the passenger transport or police joint authorities or even a so-called joint committee which could be a new joint authority by another name <e> <s> the other is whether specialist groups of expertise need to be kept together <e> <s> the two issues need to be kept separate for while i do not believe strategic london or metropolitan county councils are necessary for highways and traffic i recognise that certain specialist expertise needs to be maintained <e> <s> let me take first the question of the need for strategic authorities <e> <s> this is an <e>", "<cs> this amendment would require the secretary of state to make an annual report about certain of his functions <e> <s> i entirely agree that he should like any other minister make statements about his policy and the performance of his functions that is his duty to parliament and the public <e> <s> what i do not agree with is that there is any compelling need for him to be placed under a specific statutory obligation to report each year on some limited aspects of his functions and responsibilities <e> <s> not only would that give the selected function undue prominence it is both unnecessary and inappropriate <e>", "<cs> before turning to the detail of this amendment i should like if i may to explain a little of the background to our proposals <e> <s> london has some miles of roads <e> <s> after abolition just under miles will be the responsibility of the boroughs and the responsibility of the remaining miles will pass to the secretary of state <e> <s> while the remaining miles of trunk roads known as key routes will form the most important routes for traffic distribution in london providing links to the national network of trunk roads and motorways there are about further miles of roads of major importance for traffic movement within london <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that we need to consider in the light of the amendments made earlier this evening the appropriate course to be taken with this amendment of the noble lord lord carmichael and i think it would be to the convenience of the committee if i said no more about it at this stage <e>", "<cs> this amendment would require the secretary of state to consult all the boroughs and district councils to seek their proposals for the continuing operation and development of <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> my lords this annual exercise was one of a series to test the response of government to oil spills at sea <e> <s> this confirmed the ability to deploy rapidly available dispersant spraying aircraft to a forward operating airfield and validated assumptions on the amount of dispersant which could be applied at sea <e> <s> it also provided practical experience of operating the recently acquired remote sensing equipment on an aircraft and it exercised tested and improved working relationships between the marine pollution control unit hm coastguard and other involved agencies <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have seven dedicated aircraft on contract <e> <s> in addition to that we also have contracts on tugs which are fitted with spray dispersant equipment <e>", "<cs> my lords the proposals have been drawn up in conjunction with the hertfordshire county council which is responsible for the local road system in the st albans area <e> <s> the city and district council are being kept informed <e>", "<cs> my lords first as i said in my original answer we have been working very closely with the hertfordshire county council which is the traffic authority for the area and the district of st albans has been kept informed <e> <s> as to the second part of the noble lords supplementary question i hope that this will not have too serious an effect upon st albans city itself <e> <s> we have no plans for diversion through st albans city <e> <s> the lorry ban through st albans will not be lifted and we shall do what we can to discourage people from trying to go through st albans <e>", "<cs> my lords i think there is a certain amount of truth in what my noble friend says <e> <s> i think that the original building of the motorway with two lanes has proved to be a very false economy <e> <s> as regards maintenance i may tell him that this particular piece of road has not been repaired since it was first built in and that the time has now come when we can avoid it no longer <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of the subject of my noble friends observation <e> <s> i take note of what he has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that my noble friend was lucky <e> <s> i am afraid that if she goes up during the first two weeks of july she may not be so lucky <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until pm <e>", "<cs> i too share the desire to preserve concessionary fares and agree with the noble lord lord stallard and with others who have spoken that they are indeed a tremendous boon to the elderly and the disabled however these amendments if accepted would place specific restrictions on the powers of the ptas which would apply to no other local authority outside london <e> <s> over the rest of the country it has always been the case that local authorities had full responsibility for taking their own decisions about the level of benefits to be provided through concessionary fares <e> <s> the amendments would remove that power in the case of the ptas binding them indefinitely to decisions taken at a particular point in time by their predecessors <e>", "<cs> i think i said that it is up to the ptas within their precept control to decide for themselves how best to spend the money <e> <s> i also said that we consider that revenue support has over the years been too high <e> <s> i would suggest that they should look for savings or increased fares perhaps for ordinary travellers and hold the concessionary fares <e>", "<cs> i think i mean more or less that everybody has been travelling extremely cheaply in certain districts <e> <s> as i said revenue support has doubled in real terms since <e> <s> in the same period the shire counties have kept their support to the rate of inflation <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove explained his amendment would require mccs interests in airports to be transferred by order to the metropolitan county pta <e> <s> it removes the prior option for the metropolitan district councils to agree on the distribution of those interests among themselves and on voluntary arrangements for the continued operation of the airports <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat in the form of a statement the answer which has been given to a private notice question in another place on the announcement of job losses in british rail engineering limited <e> <s> the answer is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank both noble lords for their reception of the statement <e> <s> perhaps i may first answer the last question concerning the possibilities of job creation in both swindon and glasgow <e> <s> in swindon british rail have set up a company called swindon holdings to develop redundant parts of the work site <e> <s> they are already working on the east side of the works <e> <s> they are studying a consultants report on the scope for redevelopment potential for industrial and housing use and are aiming to set up a managed workshop by the end of the year <e> <s> in february they announced that was initially available for alternative employment and in view of yesterdays announcement that figure could be raised <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should explain to the noble lord lord shinwell that the reason for these sad closures is largely as i hoped i had explained the increase in efficiency of the new rolling stock <e> <s> for every three old-style trains which british rail used they now need only two of the new diesel multiple units and each new diesel multiple unit requires per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> less maintenance than the present rolling stock <e> <s> all that adds up to approximately half the work that needed to be done before <e> <s> the noble lord asked me what we were doing to help create extra jobs in these areas <e> <s> i have tried to answer that in my previous replies <e>", "<cs> my lords while i fully recognise the long association of the noble lord lord stoddart with swindon it is sad that on the occasion of its th anniversary this decision had to be made british rail carefully considered the options and they concluded that the closure of swindon was the only sensible option for the overall viability of british rail engineering <e> <s> each works has special skills equipment and functions and on future workload forecasts swindon could not be guaranteed a sufficient workload to be viable <e> <s> it was a difficult managment decision for british rail <e> <s> we back their judgment and there is no question of government pressure either way on british rail <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree with my noble friend <e> <s> that is why british rail engineering has had to make these difficult decisions to be able to compete in both the home and export markets in years to come <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble baroness feels that way <e> <s> i am afraid that all i can say is that i disagree with her <e>", "<cs> my lords the question asked by the noble lord lord boothby goes rather wide of the immediate statement that i have had to make <e> <s> but i agree with him and as i said earlier i hope that what can be done at swindon and in glasgow will be successful in providing new employment <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i said that in my original statement <e> <s> british rail would do all it could to find alternative work for redundant employees by offering opportunities to transfer to other works <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord bruce of donington for his reception of the order <e> <s> he has asked a number of questions which i will attempt to answer <e> <s> his first question was what had happened since and why had it taken so long <e> <s> the reason is that in there was not nearly so much transportation of this kind of fuel oil around <e> <s> secondly and probably more importantly this order hinges on the regulations specifying measuring equipment which came in in the regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords the department of trade and industry is joining with barclays bank and pa technology to present a series of seminars in all parts of the country helping small firms to understand these issues <e> <s> the department also provides extensive business and technical advisory services for small firms and has recently published a new booklet summarising the support we give and the grants available to innovate export and invest <e>", "<cs> my lords during the last year the department received approximately inquiries and arranged counselling sessions <e> <s> of these counselling sessions the first three are free after that they are per session <e>", "<cs> my lords that may well be so in which case i should say that this was an example of duplication and another reason to abolish the glc and the metropolitan counties <e>", "<cs> my lords i should say that while bankruptcies among small firms are running at a fairly high level so too are new firms starting up in fact they are i think at a record level <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate my noble friend lord strathcarron on introducing this bill <e> <s> we are fortunate in this house in having his long experience of riding motor-cycles <e> <s> i do not know whether he came to your lordships house this evening on his motor-cycle he certainly came to my office on it the other morning <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until half past eight <e>", "<cs> my lords the services of funeral undertakers are already exempt from value added tax <e> <s> the government have no plans to extend the existing relief <e>", "<cs> my lords vat exemption associated with burials and cremations applies to the services of the undertaker including making arrangements for cremation or burial disposal of ashes transport the supply of the coffin and associated goods <e> <s> however as the noble lord says it does not cover discretionary expenditure on flowers wreaths gravestones and other items <e> <s> successive governments have looked at this matter since and have decided not to extend the relief <e> <s> the death grant is under review in the current social security review and noble lords will have to await the outcome of that <e>", "<cs> my lords air freight facilities in the north of england as elsewhere are provided by airlines airports and freight forwarders in response to demand <e> <s> the growth of mixed passenger-cargo operations and the developing network of passenger flights out of regional airports particularly manchester make the outlook for freight movement out of these airports brighter <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no figures for freight from those two airports <e> <s> but as part of our liberalisation of airlinks with continental countries my honourable friend is this week visiting scandinavia where he hopes to secure agreement that should also lead to further freight traffic <e>", "<cs> my lords the provision of facilities must be a commercial decision for those involved <e> <s> the government have helped and are helping by encouraging deregulation of the industry and the liberalisation of air services and by providing capital expenditure allocations where justified <e> <s> primarily however it is a matter for customers themselves to decide where to fly from <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not have any details specifically about teesside and about whether any grant aid has been refused <e> <s> i shall have to look into that matter and write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords it does seem irrational <e> <s> i shall certainly look into that matter and let the noble lord know my findings <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try to answer some of the points which the noble lord lord carmichael has raised <e> <s> first this bill is certainly not trying to return to the bad old days of registered dock workers <e> <s> it is a question of a changing world <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord recognises that that is so <e> <s> one <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> the possibility of issuing a note was fully considered before the coin was introduced <e> <s> in practice it would probably circulate much as the note does now and would therefore reach the same sorry state just as quickly <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards being the only country to do this other countries have tried two unit notes and they have not on the whole been successful france and the united states of america are examples <e> <s> other countries have also introduced coins instead of notes <e> <s> australia new zealand germany and france have all replaced their lower value notes with coins <e> <s> as for the composition of the committee i am afraid that i do not have those details with me <e> <s> i shall have to write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the cost of million is not the only reason for our having withdrawn the pound note <e> <s> the fact is that the notes were becoming increasingly tatty <e> <s> they were being returned to banks much less than they used to be and were circulating like coins <e> <s> that is why the notes became very tatty <e> <s> i find the coin most attractive <e>", "<cs> and many people will soon get used to it <e>", "<cs> my lords not being a frequent visitor to scotland i cannot say how tatty their notes become <e> <s> but i can say again that the pound coin the scottish pound coin and the welsh pound coin are just as good <e>", "<cs> my lords it was considered whether to make notes out of a better quality paper or from plastic <e> <s> however the tougher material would not solve the main problem which is as i have mentioned that the pound circulates like a coin nowadays <e> <s> the coin also has advantages for use in vending and slot machines <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said it is perfectly possible for scottish pound notes to circulate south of the border but in time they will deteriorate in the same way as the english pound notes <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly take note of what my noble friend has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i gather that they were unpopular <e>", "<cs> my lords have absolutely no evidence for that figure <e> <s> i think it is very unlikely to be true <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly not <e> <s> perhaps they are becoming tatty but at least they are holding their value better than they used to do <e>", "<cs> before turning to the detail of this amendment i should like if i may to explain a little of the background to our proposals <e> <s> london has some miles of roads <e> <s> after abolition just under miles will be the responsibility of the boroughs and the responsibility of the remaining miles will pass to the secretary of state <e> <s> while the remaining miles of trunk roads known as key routes will form the most important routes for traffic distribution in london providing links to the national network of trunk roads and motorways there are about further miles of roads of major importance for traffic movement within london <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have noted the boards concern <e> <s> my right honourable friend will be discussing their views with the boards chairman shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords we have noted carefully the report of the overseas trade board and a most useful report it is <e> <s> the action that we are proposing to take is by international effort to reduce by multilateral agreement all forms of export subsidies so <e>", "<cs> my lords there are criticisms <e> <s> as far as ecgd is concerned it provides a wide range of facilities for capital goods exporters but from time to time changes to existing schemes and their terms and conditions will have to be made <e> <s> the government accept that changes are needed to make the ecgd more commercially orientated and responsive to industrys needs <e> <s> it is for this reason that a study is currently in hand to consider how the needs highlighted in the matthews report can best be met within the existing institutional structure <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government made no such decision <e> <s> decisions on the future of railway engineering works such as those at swindon are a matter for the british railways board and their subsidiary british rail engineering limited who have put a proposal for closure to their trade unions <e> <s> as i explained to your lordships house on th may british rail and brel have concluded that workshop capacity must be reduced to match the fall in repair and maintenance workload which is resulting from british rails investment in new rolling stock <e>", "<cs> my lords it is hoped that some of the people at swindon will be able to go to other british rail engineering workshops <e> <s> indeed it is hoped that with an efficient british rail engineering limited they will be able to secure valuable export orders <e>", "<cs> my lords i did indeed say that the closure of these particular works was a matter for the british railways board <e> <s> however the government are obviously keen that british rail engineering limited should make itself as efficient as possible <e> <s> to do so unfortunately it needs to rationalise its operation <e> <s> as i think i said on th may when i made the statement it is fortunately through the large investment being made by british rail that the equipment used is becoming so much more efficient that it needs a good deal less maintenance <e>", "<cs> my lords in this case at swindon british rail engineering limited has set up a company called swindon holdings to develop the site and to assist with alternative employment <e> <s> it initially made a contribution of three-quarters of a million pounds which will probably have to be raised to one-and-a-quarter million pounds <e>", "<cs> my lords we can and will compete for railway work in other parts of the world but the only way we can do it is by rationalising the operation making it more efficient and therefore competitive <e>", "<cs> my lords swindon is a repair workshop and as i said the amount of repair needed now is very much less than it was <e> <s> a new diesel multiple

employees by offering them opportunities to transfer to other works and by encouraging business development and job creation at both swindon and glasgow <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend <e> <s> he is more familiar with the original act than i am <e> <s> i have merely tried to do my best to answer the questions <e> <s> perhaps i should not have done that <e> <s> as i said in my original answer it was not a decision made by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords the british railways board indeed gave my right honourable friend the secretary of state advance notice of these proposals <e> <s> as i have said they are a matter for the british railways board and not for the government <e> <s> the government put no pressure one way or the other on the board in regard to the decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i hoped that i had explained that through increased investment in british rail the consequences are that the equipment had become more efficient and more effective and therefore needs less maintenance <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely right <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly not <e> <s> at the risk of repeating what i said in quoting the statement on th may this government have a record second to none as regards investment in the railways <e>", "<cs> my lords british rail engineering ltd are trying to find work for them by having set up this company to which i referred swindon holdings <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot say how many but one very much hopes that the site will be a popular one <e> <s> swindon is in a growth area and many small businesses could prosper there <e>", "<cs> on behalf of the government i support this amendment to incorporate a new clause <e> <s> as my friend has explained it concerns another aspect of the relationship between copyright law and computers which is in urgent need of clarification <e> <s> the bill as it stands is concerned only with the application of copyright law to computer programs but it is clear that computers have a much greater impact on copyright than that <e> <s> it is an everyday occurrence for many copyright works to be stored in or even created within computers and how copyright law at present applies in these cases is subject to some doubt <e>", "<cs> i can very quickly say that my noble friend is correct <e>", "<cs> i have already said that i support the amendment <e> <s> i should just say to the noble lord lord mcintosh that obviously we shall have to take each case on its merits <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate my noble friend on the introduction of his first bill after years in your lordships house <e> <s> i hope that future bills that he introduces will attract as much widespread support from all quarters <e> <s> my noble friend has explained the bill so clearly that there is very little left for me to say <e> <s> it is a modest measure relatively simple and straightforward but nonethless one which should make life rather easier for many motorists <e>", "<cs> my lords at the end of march the latest figures available there were ships with a total deadweight tonnage of million tonnes in the united kingdom registered merchant fleet of gross tonnes and over <e> <s> the corresponding figures for the end of march were ships and million deadweight tonnes <e> <s> i am informed that the number of seamen on the general council of british shipping register at the end of march was compared with at the end of march <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all i would not say that the situation is one of total collapse <e> <s> the reasons for the decline are fairly straightforward they concern changes in trading patterns <e> <s> i think it is worth pointing out that per cent <e> <s> of the decline has been in the tanker fleet and the reasons for that are fairly clear <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the noble lord a precise figure for the number of <e>", "<cs> my lords that is indeed true <e> <s> the increase in fleets of less developed countries with their lower crewing costs has been a contributory factor <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all i think i am responsible in your lordships house for answering for the department of transport to which this question is directed <e> <s> the noble lord lord hatch quoted my honourable friend as saying that he expected more british ships to flag out <e> <s> he speaks for the government <e> <s> obviously that is not government policy it is his opinion of what may happen <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the increase in the broad money stock as measured by sterling m seasonally adjusted over the five years to mid-april was per cent <e> <s> the increase in notes and cash in circulation outside the bank of england accounted for just over per cent <e> <s> of this increase <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason for the increase in the broad money stock to which the noble lord referred is the much larger aggregate most of which is interesting-bearing <e> <s> narrow money contains no interesting-bearing element being mostly transactions balances <e> <s> the innovation in the financial markets has had different impacts tending to reduce demand for transactions balances but perhaps raising the demand for deposits with an increase in the demand for liquid assets as a form of savings <e>", "<cs> my lords sterling m i agree is above target but the narrow margin m is firmly on track <e> <s> as the noble lord says real interest rates are still high and there is little other indication that monetary conditions are not tight enough <e> <s> but no risks will be taken with inflation <e> <s> interest rates will be held at whatever level is needed to maintain monetary conditions which will continue to bring inflation down <e>", "<cs> my lords i take note of what the noble lord says and i think the best thing i can do is to draw his remarks to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i reject the charge that my right honourable friend varies it according to what suits his particular purpose <e> <s> the two main factors are m and m and they are given equal weight <e> <s> they will continue to be interpreted in the

remarks to the attention of my right honourable friend and that is about as far as i can go at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord kaberry has made several interesting points in support of amendments nos <e> <s> b a and a and has drawn on his considerable experience in west yorkshire <e> <s> he expressed similar concern in committee when he proposed that responsibility for the highways and traffic functions on the most important of the metropolitan county council roads should be given to the police authority <e> <s> we heard several noble lords express concern about good management in regard to these main roads known technically as principal roads and your lordships added what is now clause to the bill against the advice of the government as a possible way forward <e>", "<cs> my lords the metropolitan district councils co-operate with one another on the basis of perhaps a lead district taking control of the urban traffic control system and those districts concerned with that urban traffic control system would apportion the cost among themselves and the lead district <e> <s> i think that would be the solution <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house again for a third time all i have said i think is that my noble friend lord elton earlier explained that we wished to take a view on clause once we had seen the overall outcome of your lordships consideration of the bill <e> <s> i therefore do not think it is entirely unreasonable for me on my part to attempt to resist a suggestion in the form of an amendment which i believe can be better handled by voluntary co-operation and i do not think that noble lords should set aside this opportunity for voluntary co-operation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not in a position this evening to answer the noble lord about the proposed contraflow system in westminster <e> <s> however i recognise that this amendment appears to make a technical improvement to the provisions of clause as passed by your lordships in committee <e> <s> although i am willing to accept without commitment this amendment to clause i cannot advise your lordships to extend clause which this amendment does not do <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> a seeks to remedy the technical deficiency in the description of the traffic powers to be transferred to the joint transport authorities under clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord carmichael for his explanation of amendments nos <e> <s> a b and c <e> <s> i was not quite clear as to their purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord talked about amendments nos <e> <s> b and c <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case i shall confine my remarks to amendments nos <e> <s> and a <e> <s> i was still not quite clear as to their purpose <e> <s> they leave the substance of clause and allow schedules and to remain in the bill <e> <s> what they remove is the declaration of the principal purpose of the clause and also the references to the transfers of function intended by the government <e> <s> the noble lord has explained why he feels that the words to be removed are now no longer appropriate and what he now intends should be the position particularly regarding payment of transport supplementary grant provided for in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i recognise the noble lords point in trying to tidy up clause <e> <s> he has spoken about the need to permit the residuary body to receive transport supplementary grant in london since that body would be responsible for a large network of roads <e> <s> again i do not feel strongly about this matter and i shall be content to accept amendments nos <e> <s> b and c without commitment <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment raises an issue which has been widely discussed and personally i welcome this opportunity for a further <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords discussions are continuing with the authorities concerned about many aspects of traffic congestion in central london in which coaches and lorries play a part <e>", "<cs> my lords i sympathise with the noble lord <e> <s> i would say however that this is primarily a matter for the glc and the borough councils <e> <s> we for our part met the glc and the local authorities in may when the subject was discussed <e> <s> we are meeting westminster city council next week to talk specifically about coaches and we are also taking part in discussions with london regional transport the police and other interested parties <e>", "<cs> my lords i am under the impression that there is some such arrangement <e> <s> i am <e>", "<cs> my lords i would say that the traffic authority for london is the glc and perhaps at the moment we are doing something <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all i do not accept that the transport bill will worsen the situation in london which is what the question refers to <e> <s> secondly the powers that the glc at present has strengthened by the london regional transport act last year as regards sightseeing coaches will be retained by the successor authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the noble lords point <e> <s> i would however say that tourism is an important part of the economy of london these days <e> <s> we must balance these things <e> <s> we must do what we can to encourage tourists at the same time seeing to it that we do not clog up the city completely <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree with the noble lord in many ways <e> <s> as i say that is why we are looking at this matter with the glc and the borough councils and westminster city council in particular <e> <s> i hope that something constructive will come from those discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the situation in the victoria area though i would point out that in fact the number of coaches using victoria coach station is more or less the same as it was many years ago <e> <s> however i do not disagree that the other traffic has increased <e> <s> i am aware also of the pollution aspect which the noble lord lord ezra raised last time we had a discussion on this matter <e> <s> i have been in communication with him and i have undertaken that the warren spring laboratory will look into that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that his suspicions are entirely unfounded <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a little uncertain as to what i say but i understand that in years gone by many noble lords and others had labels on their cars <e> <s> i understand that those were removed for security reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords that is probably a very helpful suggestion from my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise that these amendments are consequential on the change made in committee to the allocation of strategic highway functions <e> <s> on that basis the government have no objection to them but i must emphasise to the noble lord that our agreement does not signify our commitment to the change in allocation <e> <s> as my noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i nave already indicated that the government accept the amendments standing in the name of the noble earl lord cranbrook and indeed those of the noble lord lord carmichael <e> <s> in saying that i must add that strategic transportation authority is a bit of a mouthful especially when no doubt preceded by the name of the area concerned for instance the tyne and wear strategic transportation authority <e> <s> i think it a bit of a mouthful but i accept the amendment nevertheless <e>", "<cs> my lords having accepted amendment no <e> <s> in the name of my noble friend lord cranbrook and the subsequent amendment no <e> <s> a in the name of the noble lord lord carmichael i would also accept all the others amendments nos <e> <s> a a a za and a <e> <s> i need not detain the house any more on any of those <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may briefly respond to the noble lord these plans are prepared by the ptes and they will continue to be responsible for the planning of public transport <e> <s> i agree with him that the composition of the pta will be different from the current metropolitan county council but it will have the advice of the pte in the plan <e> <s> i think that he would agree with me that it would be unfair to press upon the successor authority the plans made by the outgoing authority <e> <s> therefore the new pta the strategic transport authority should have the last say in these plans <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i made clear in the committee stage that the government fully share the desire to preserve concessionary fares <e> <s> schedule to the bill provides ptas with the same powers as exist in local authorities to provide such schemes and to enter into agreements with other areas outside the metropolitan county councils which was a point which the noble lord lord stallard raised <e> <s> in practice i have no doubt that the ptas will continue to operate concessionary fare schemes and that those schemes will cover all the categories of people mentioned in the act as they do at present <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord carmichael moved an identical amendment in committee so the noble lord lord tordoff has had plenty of time <e> <s> the noble lord lord carmichael made it clear then that his principal concern in so doing was to ensure certainty in decision making about the operation in the future of the airports <e> <s> he has repeated that concern today <e> <s> i explained when i responded to his amendment in committee why i believe it is right to provide as the bill currently does for the metropolitan county councils interests in airports to be transferred by order either directly to the metropolitan district council or only if they fail to agree on the operation of the airport by a committee of districts and the transfer of mcc interests to them to the relevant metropolitan county pta <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> the government consider that since the costs of the lighthouse services are incurred in meeting the needs of the marine community they should be paid by that community <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords question is extremely timely <e> <s> my right honourable friend published yesterday a report on the structure of light dues that has been prepared by arthur andersen and co consultant accountants <e> <s> the

parties to the report published yesterday <e> <s> we shall then see in what way the system should be restructured <e>", "<cs> my lords the report as i say was published yesterday and copies are or will be shortly available in the library of your lordships house <e> <s> we are awaiting responses from the industry <e> <s> we have asked for these to be in by september <e> <s> obviously we shall be looking at the whole matter of how these charges should be structured <e> <s> regarding the decline in the british fleet the noble lord lord davies has another question down for next tuesday specifically on this question <e> <s> if i may i shall leave it until then <e>", "<cs> my lords most of the factors that have led to the recent reduction in the united kingdom merchant fleet are outside the control of either the industry or the government <e> <s> nevertheless we are doing a great deal to create conditions internationally which will ensure opportunities for our merchant fleet and thus favour the retention of vessels by united kingdom shipowners preferably under the united kingdom flag <e> <s> the key element is the implementation of an ec shipping policy which will enable our owners to compete on equal terms with companies inside and outside the community <e>", "<cs> my lords in the budget this year we did extend the depreciation of writing-down allowances on new ships to that of second-hand ships <e> <s> it was extended this year <e>", "<cs> my lords the committee to which the noble lord lord grimond refers is probably the sea group study to which i referred in answer to his question in february <e> <s> it was to look particularly into the defence needs of our shipping <e> <s> those reports have been received by the department and are being carefully considered at the moment in conjunction with the ministry of defence <e> <s> we are looking at them most carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords we are obviously concerned <e> <s> it is however important to say that it is not the same situation across the whole sector of the fleet <e> <s> the sharpest decline of all has been in oil tankers which account for nearly per cent <e> <s> of the fall in tonnage <e> <s> the reasons are fairly obvious to us in this country <e> <s> the second sharpest fall has occurred i believe in dry bulk cargo ships <e> <s> again it is a very competitive world market <e> <s> as far as passenger liners container ships and ferries are concerned those sectors are doing really quite well at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed we are aware of united kingdom owners flagging out <e> <s> we want to see ships operating profitably under the british flag <e> <s> but we cannot force our operators to operate at a loss <e> <s> i would also point out to the noble lord that some per cent <e> <s> of our own tonnage is ultimately beneficially owned abroad and therefore flagged in <e>", "<cs> my lords i would say to the noble lord as he has received my letter that preceding the remark that we see no need for further investigation is the fact that we are only too well aware of the decline and the reasons for it <e> <s> i have tried to explain to your lordships some of the reasons why there has been a decline not only in our shipping but in shipping throughout the whole of the western world <e>", "<cs> my lords the role that the fleet plays in support of defence forces in civil supply in times of emergency is well recognised <e> <s> it is subject to continuous planning and review <e> <s> in addition as a member of nato we are pledged to pool our resources in the event of a war affecting the alliance <e> <s> the main defence requirement is not for a fleet of a given size but for specific types of vessels <e> <s> if necessary we can deal with shortages by particular not direct action <e> <s> i would say to the noble lord that this is the subject of the studies that we have been undertaking <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly take careful note of what my noble friend says <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i shall have to find out the answer to that and write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords the economic secretary to the treasury announced detailed proposals for new building society legislation in a speech earlier this month to the annual conference of the building societies association <e> <s> he said he hoped that the legislation would be introduced in parliament this autumn <e> <s> copies of his speech have been placed in the library of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor has recently reaffirmed the governments commitment to allow solicitors employed by banks building societies and other organisations to offer a conveyancing service <e> <s> the government are still considering how best to give effect to this <e>", "<cs> my lords on the point of the smaller societies my honourable friend said that he believed that it would be a pity if the existing variety of building societies was lost and he hoped that the present variety would continue and indeed develop because a diverse movement is a healthy one <e> <s> on the question of democracy in the building societies he has outlined more or less as in the green paper his proposals for election to the board etc <e>", "<cs> my lords it is indeed the governments intention to provide arrangements which avoid subjecting solicitors to a conflict between the interests of their clients and those of their employer <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that construction of the docklands light railway running from tower hill to island gardens and stratford which the government approved last august is proceeding satisfactorily and we expect the railway to be in full operation by mid- <e> <s> i also understand that london regional transport and the london docklands development corporation are preparing plans for submission to the government in due course in connection with a proposal to extend the railway to the area of the royal docks <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords all parties agreed that the turn-key approach which involves a package deal covering both the civil engineering works and the mechanical and electrical engineering aspects was to be preferred <e> <s> it offers significant advantages in terms of tight project management within an agreed timescale and cost limits <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it means that the developers agree with the contractors that at the end of the day basically they have the project and they can turn the key on it and there you are it is all complete <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord tordoff and i entirely agree with him <e>", "<cs> my lords we have not yet received the report of professor horne and his team <e> <s> we expect to receive it in the next few weeks and will take an early decision about publication <e>", "<cs> my lords those are matters which of course professor horne has been investigating in his review <e> <s> unfortunately professor horne was taken ill last year but i am glad to be able to say that he is better now <e> <s> that caused a delay in our receipt of the report <e> <s> as i say we expect to receive it within a very short time from now <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with my noble friend <e> <s> i hope that when we receive this report professor horne will have found some solutions to this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly again draw the attention of my right honourable friend to the select committees report <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lords lord shepherd and lord tordoff for bringing this amendment forward because it allows me to repeat the governments intention that safety should be preserved and enhanced in this bill <e> <s> if i could explain the role of the vehicle examiners to noble lords among other duties they will enforce the law relating to the construction and safety of goods and passenger vehicles conduct annual tests on public service vehicles and have under sections and of the act as extended by clause of

department of transport for these powers to authorise special signing <e>", "<cs> well my lords i hope that our exchanges this afternoon may cause them to think about this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords

an unparliamentary term the noble lord is getting slightly hot under the collar <e> <s> as i said the local authorities still have the powers under the road traffic regulation act to control access by buses lorries and so on to certain parts of their town or city if they so wish <e> <s> all i am saying is that under the traffic regulation conditions imposed by the traffic commissioner as we propose he is able to discriminate between one operator and another <e> <s> that is why i say that he is impartial in that he can say to one operator that he must use a bus stop at one end of the street and to another operator that he must use the bus stop at the other end of the street <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord carmichael for explaining the amendment because i must admit that i was not quite sure what he was actually getting at in moving it <e> <s> perhaps i may explain that an operators licence issued by any traffic commissioner is valid throughout great britain <e> <s> an operator needs a licence from each commissioner in whose area he has an operating centre but he can run services in an area in which he does not have an operating centre <e> <s> it is easy to see that

traffic regulations act as being probably the main weapon in defence <e> <s> i cannot give the noble lord the assurance that we will consider his <e>", "<cs> i hope that i can answer my noble friend very briefly and to his satisfaction <e> <s> i can assure your lordships that those words in section <e>", "<cs> these amendments suppose a bus industry very different from the one that will emerge after deregulation <e> <s> if we were proposing that bus services should be protected monopolies planned and co-ordinated by local authorities then the elaborate consultative machinery proposed might well provide a useful means of finding out what services passengers want and how well they operate in responding to passengers wishes <e> <s> even then the machinery would be a very imperfect one <e> <s> we are proposing something which we consider to be infinitely better that is that operators should be allowed to compete to provide the services people want <e> <s> the incentive of competition will make the bus industry more sensitive to the demands of customers <e>", "<cs> i apologise <e> <s> i said that we consulted them about whether they wished to see such consultative committees established <e> <s> the authorities felt that they could represent the interests of their own electors to put it more simply and i must say that i agree <e> <s> we would encourage authorities and councillors to consult widely on their policies and nothing in the bill prevents them from doing that <e> <s> consultation not just of specified groups is part and parcel of normal democratic procedures <e> <s> therefore i think that not <e>", "<cs> i am entirely in agreement with my noble friend that it would be a pity if the post office were no longer to be able to continue to offer the services which it gives at the present time with regard to selling bus tickets and passes and so on and particularly so in the case of sub-post offices which i think we would all wish to see have the opportunity of doing as much business as they can <e> <s> i therefore find my noble friends arguments very persuasive <e> <s> i should just like to enter one reservation which is that when we look at this amendment in detail we might find it more complex than it appears to be <e> <s> my noble friend has said that his amendment was only put down at very short notice and i am afraid that i have not had the chance to discuss it with my department nor with parliamentary counsel <e> <s> however i am entirely in sympathy with his arguments and i shall give him an assurance that we shall look at this very seriously and i shall be in touch with my noble friend <e> <s> i hope that on that undertaking he will be willing to withdraw the amendment for the time being <e>", "<cs> i believe a misunderstanding has given rise to this amendment <e> <s> clause requires councils to secure services they consider appropriate to meet any public transport requirements within their areas <e> <s> what we are proposing is that councils should be required to secure services as they think appropriate to meet requirements which arise within their area <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> of course we accept that co-operation between local authorities and operators can be highly desirable and as we have explained to the committee on earlier clauses we have given authorities considerable powers both to subsidise public transport and to take more general measures to promote the use of public transport and the convenience of the public <e> <s> there are further important provisions on tendering and concessionary fares <e> <s> we have no doubt that many authorities will make extensive use of those powers and we expect that they will have a wide measure of co-operation of operators in doing so <e> <s> that will often be to the mutual benefit of both sides and for the good of the general public as passengers and as ratepayers <e>", "<cs> noble lords will be aware of the governments recent white paper stressing the need to keep burdens of this kind to a minimum <e>", "<cs> my lords traffic congestion in central london is at present primarily a matter for the glc as traffic authority <e> <s> however the government are discussing the many aspects of the problem with representatives of the london borough councils and with the police and other bodies concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords as i hope i indicated in my original answer to the noble lord the government are concerned about the problem <e> <s> we have several proposals in hand <e> <s> the white paper on <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are critical of the glc for the obvious reason that traffic conditions in london are bad and traffic has been the glcs responsibility for a number of years

lords lord boothbys question specifically relates to the density of traffic in central london and that will be of concern mainly to the westminster city council and the surrounding boroughs <e> <s> i hardly think that any input from the outlying boroughs such as perhaps hillingdon or hounslow can help in the present situation to alleviate the problem in central london <e>", "<cs> my lords first i do not accept that the present legislation dilutes their powers <e> <s> we have had several meetings with westminster city council and one took place as recently as yesterday <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state and my honourable friend the minister of state intend to meet the leader of westminster city council next tuesday to discuss these matters and to point out to the council the very real powers that they currently possess under the road traffic regulations act under section of which they can prescribe routes to be <e>", "<cs> my lords overseas tourism to london is a very important part of londons economy and a major provider of jobs <e> <s> i very much hope that we can find a satisfactory solution to this problem which does not stop these coaches coming into london but which will hopefully find as i indicated earlier in our discussion somewhere better to put them <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already indicated that the department has initiated four traffic assessment studies and i hope that something positive will come out of them <e> <s> i would not agree entirely with the noble lord that all the routes out of london are unsatisfactory particularly those which i know of to the west and the south-west <e> <s> in my view they are reasonably satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the report to which the noble lord has referred which i think came out only today and therefore i have not had time to study it myself <e> <s> the noble lord will also be aware that we have not gone ahead with the common market proposals to raise the weight of heavy lorries and i hope that he will be pleased with that decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the fares fair controversy which took place some years ago <e> <s> i point out that under the current management of lrt traffic is still increasing and in our view at the moment the balance between ratepayer and passenger is the correct one <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i have not visited the first two cities which the noble lord mentioned but i have visited paris <e> <s> however i am grateful for what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try to answer one or two of the points raised by the noble lords lord underhill and lord tordoff <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill asked me whether this meant an abandonment of the principles of the circular <e> <s> i should remind him that the route proposed was announced in after the circular had been issued by the administration of which the noble lord lord underhill was a member and it is not for me to speak on their behalf <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg the noble lords pardon <e> <s> it is unwise to assume that that administration did not consider in the interaction of national roads a national parks policy before reaching their decision <e> <s> there is no question that a decision by parliament to proceed with the southern route would ruin the national parks policy <e> <s> the government have to consider the balance of advantages and disadvantages when policies interact as they do in okehampton <e> <s> we decided that the balance lay in favour of the southern route and following exhaustive debate the inspector agreed <e> <s> both noble lords in effect asked me whether this was not a slap in the face for the joint select committee <e> <s> not at all <e> <s> the act under which the joint committee considered this matter also provides for a confirming bill procedure <e> <s> an act of parliament can hardly be considered unconstitutional or a slap in the face for the select committee <e> <s> furthermore there is a precedent for this and it has already been used in in the case of the mid-northamptonshire water board authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot entirely agree with my noble friend <e> <s> first of all i have quoted the precedent of when the confirming bill procedure was used <e> <s> secondly i should like to quote from <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord mulley for his remarks <e> <s> i can confirm that we are looking at the planning procedure in general terms and i do not know how close we are to reaching any sort of conclusion <e> <s> i should like to repeat the assurance that i have given the house that in no way does that alter our attitude to the national parks policy of circular of <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the second point which my noble friend raised it certainly will be regarded as very much the exception hut i would point out that the circular itself says <e>", "<cs> my lords we are of course grateful for the work which the joint committee did <e> <s> many of the matters the noble lord has raised as he quite rightly said will no doubt be hotly debated when this bill comes before your lordships house <e> <s> i can confirm that the bill will reach us as it were at the report stage and we shall then have a report stage and third reading so there will be at lest two opportunities to debate the matter <e> <s> it will be a very short bill a matter of one clause only i understand so the issue will not be difficult to decide <e>", "<cs> my lords because subject to these two compulsory purchase orders which is really what we are talking about today the rest of the line of the route is decided and construction can start as soon as or if the two compulsory purchase orders are agreed to by both houses <e> <s> as regards the northern route time would have to be taken on a public inquiry and we would need to establish a new line of route <e> <s> i would also point out although this is probably a matter to be dealt with when the bill comes before us that there are important engineering difficulties to be dealt with on the northern route <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft food imitations safety amendment regulations laid before the house on st june be approved <e> <s> the effect of the amendment is expressly to exclude products made entirely of food ingredients from the scope of the food imitations safety regulations statutory instrument number which your lordships approved on th january this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord carmichael and my noble friend baroness elliot for giving me the opportunity to explain the governments policy on competition legislation in the context of the bus industry after deregulation <e> <s> the main point to make is that we envisage the bus industry like the broad range of british industry operating in future within the framework of the competition legislation <e> <s> our intention in this bill as noble lords will know is to introduce competition and market forces into the bus industry where they have had insufficient influence for too long <e> <s> it follows that the competition legislation which applies elsewhere should apply here <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has done the committee a service in drawing attention to the importance of the matters that may come before the transport tribunal importance not only for the persons involved all appeals are important for the appellants but in a wider context <e> <s> its decisions like those of any court can make law in the sense of interpreting the words of a statute perhaps not always as its framers had themselves in mind <e> <s> it is relevant that the point to which my noble friend alluded that of the nature of good repute comes from an eec directive <e> <s> he has also done well to draw our attention to the fact that there are scarcely ever two parties to an appeal to the tribunal only the appellant <e>", "<cs> i should certainly like to take this away and look carefully at it <e> <s> i yield to no one in my lack of knowledge on the difference between may and shall in legal terms <e> <s> we shall definitely look at this and come back later <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has explained with great clarity that if the bill is to work we must have an early date by which nbc subsidiaries are in the form in which they will be competing fairly after deregulation and by which the pte and municipal undertakings will have been transferred to companies <e> <s> i think i should try to deal first with the difficulties i see in my noble friends suggestion that we should include a particular date st may in the bill although my noble friend said he was not absolutely wedded to that date <e> <s> i shall then turn to the points which he made about the relationship between his amendment and the transitional provision of schedule <e>", "<cs> under clause they will have to have submitted a disposal programme <e> <s> but that does not mean to say that they will actually have to have disposed of the separate companies <e> <s> again as the noble lord lord shepherd pointed out they will be expected to compete fairly one with another and to operate as if they were apart even if they are not <e>", "<cs> my lords as the government have frequently stated the procurement practices of british telecom are a matter for the commercial judgment of the company <e> <s> the director generals advice-giving role apart the director generals powers to intervene in bts decisions stem from bts licence responsibilities <e> <s> in this instance the director generals conclusion was that bt had acted within those responsibilities <e> <s> however he intends to keep bts future buying policy for digital exchanges under careful review in the light of the competition legislation <e> <s> the government have been pleased to note and regard as significant the chairman of bts confirmation of his companys continuing commitment to system x as the basis of investment in digital switching <e>", "<cs> my lords i have indeed read the director generals report and i commend your lordships to read it <e> <s> as i said in my original answer he did not find that bt had acted outside their responsibilities <e> <s> as regards the loss of jobs at plessey and gec recently we are of course sorry to hear about that and we accept that in part those may have been <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the powers of oftel the director generals duties are set out in the legislation agreed by your lordships house last year <e> <s> it is of course open to the director general to suggest that his duties should be altered but he has not done so <e>", "<cs> my lords we are obviously very interested in what the director general has had to say and we find the report most valuable <e> <s> as regards what was said in this house during the passage of the bill i think the noble lord will find that as the director general has reported british telecom have not acted outside their responsibilities <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not wish to anticipate the privatisation of british gas but my noble friend has no doubt seen oftels decision as reported in the newspapers this morning regarding the interconnection of the mercury network and that is promoting competition <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall have to wait and see what happens over that matter <e> <s> it is reported that bt have said charges will go up <e> <s> we shall have to wait and see whether that actually happens <e>", "<cs> my lords we naturally hope that large manufacturers will succeed in britain but that is a very different question from the one which is on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the figures for other european countries as to whether or not they buy from overseas <e> <s> however i can assure my noble friend that we are continuing our efforts to press other european countries to follow our lead in liberalising their markets thereby creating an equality of opportunity for commercial sales as well as benefits to the customers <e>", "<cs> my lords i disagree that the system is being departed from <e> <s> british telecom have said on many occasions including in the press notice which they issued concerning this report that they regard system x as their main system in <e>", "<cs> my lords when we discussed this in committee our debate concentrated on the establishment of the formal statutory consultative committee to represent all public transport users <e> <s> we did not believe that such mechanisms are necessary in a deregulated competitive industry <e> <s> i note that the noble lord lord tordoff has not returned to quite the same thing <e> <s> instead he suggests something which sounds far less burdensome and entirely reasonable that local authorities should consult representatives of public transport users at the time they formulate policies for subsidising services <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we have reached a suitable moment to adjourn further consideration on report until oclock <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend has stated the purpose of clause is to provide an essential flexibility for authorities to take prompt action without recourse to tendering to avoid disruption of services on which the public rely <e> <s> these can be services which were about to stop operating or services which have suddenly cease to operate <e> <s> in those cases the bill gives authorities the flexibility to make arrangements to ensure continuity of services until tenders can be invited and a service substitute agreement entered into in the normal way <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened most carefully to the point that the noble lord lord tordoff has made <e> <s> as i say we felt that authorities should have sufficient warning for this kind of thing but if this is indeed the case i think it is something that we should look at <e> <s> i shall definitely look at this and come back to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i should expect that it was possible but as i have said to my noble friend lord teviot i shall look into this and come back to him <e> <s> however i think we shall find that it is possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord mcintosh for moving this amendment and giving me the opportunity to explain fully the scope of clause <e> <s> this clause enables authorities to enter into emergency agreements without recourse to tendering to maintain existing services or to reinstate services which have ceased to operate <e> <s> although this provision is intended to give authorities important flexibility in subsidising services generally it will apply equally to the transitional period as this group of clauses will be commenced <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we have reached a suitable moment for me to propose that we adjourn further consideration on report until oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i believe that the next amendment to be taken is amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i did indeed undertake to look into this matter when my noble friend lord colville of culross raised the matter in committee and i have done so <e> <s> i can assure noble lords that there is no room for doubt as to the meaning of the provision as drafted <e>", "<cs> my lords it is its use in conjunction with the unconditional negative that makes all the difference <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree and i beg to move that the house do adjourn for five minutes until while we discuss this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems that we have reached a convenient moment to interrupt the proceedings and i suggest that we do not return to our consideration of commons amendments before ten minutes past eight oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the commons amendments be further considered <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord said we have debated this very fully on previous stages of the bill and also the suggestion that the ptes will be required to meet residual costs following the formation of the company <e> <s> the government have said very clearly that they have seen no evidence to suggest there will be significant costs of this nature <e> <s> it is also said that any costs which do arise should appropriately be met by the executive <e> <s> i do not think your lordships will want me to go into these arguments again at this stage because we have before us specific new amendments concerned with the way in which the executives and their authorities may meet any costs which arise <e> <s> but like the noble lord i felt i must put this matter into context <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we have reached a suitable moment for us to break for a short while <e> <s> therefore i beg to move that further proceedings after third reading be now adjourned until oclock <e>", "<cs> eighty my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord gray of contin i beg to introduce a bill to put the finances of the united kingdom atomic energy authority on a trading fund basis and for connected purposes <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government contributed million to the international tin council under the sixth international tin agreement <e> <s> the total of all members initial contributions in the form of cash or tin metal to the agreement was equivalent to tonnes of tin metal at a tonne <e> <s> it is not possible at this stage to assess the impact of recent developments on the united kingdoms tin mining industry <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the first question my right honourable friend the secretary of state for trade and industry has made it clear to the international tin council that they should honour their legal commitments to the council up to th october when dealings were suspended and we have certainly said that we shall honour ours <e>", "<cs> my lords i am interested in the points that the noble lord makes <e> <s> however i fear that the crisis could well have taken place whether or not the london metal exchange had had a central clearing system <e> <s> the crisis has arisen through the over-production of tin over the years <e>", "<cs> my lords our obligation is as to per cent <e> <s> of the total amount of the international tin agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been no statement of reluctance by these developing countries to comply with their obligations <e> <s> we as a government have tabled firm proposals for settling the councils liabilities and these are being studied by other member countries <e> <s> it is hoped that there will be a positive outcome to the councils meeting on thursday <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is right in the first part of his question <e> <s> as for compensatory backing for the producing countries that is another question that i am unable to answer at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a detailed matter for british telecom <e> <s> the company has devoted considerable efforts towards modernising extending and improving the range of services offered to its customers <e> <s> privatisation liberalisation of products and services and competition have provided additional spurs to british telecoms own efforts to meet and anticipate its customers needs <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that british telecom will be grateful for the noble lords remarks regarding the connection of lines and i hope that it will also take note of the remarks he made about certain areas of business users <e> <s> regarding the recent price increases of british telecom my noble friend asked a question only about a couple of weeks ago which my noble friend lord lucas of chilworth answered <e> <s> i have nothing to add to what my noble friend said on that day except to say that as my noble friend is no doubt aware the director general of oftel has confirmed that the prices meet the terms of the licence but i think he had also other rerharks to make to british telecom <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said to my noble friend lord orr-ewing just now the director <e>", "<cs> my lords i have really nothing further to add to what i have now already said twice the director general of oftel has looked into these price increases and has said that they are within the terms of the licence <e> <s> the overall price increase remains at per cent <e> <s> below inflation and will remain at that level until the end of this decade <e>", "<cs> my lords i have indeed noticed that the price of a second-class stamp has gone down a penny <e> <s> as for what the telecommunications users association have said i take note of their views and i am sure that the director general of oftel also has taken note of their views <e>", "<cs> my lords i should tend to agree with my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls <e> <s> i think i should like to say that as a result of the privatisation of british telecom there have been many improvements in the service <e> <s> my noble friend lord orr-ewing mentioned the reduction in waiting times for a connection of lines <e> <s> i should also mention that the new telephone kiosks which are a great deal less likely to be vandalised are kept cleaner and are also much better for the disabled <e> <s> furthermore one is now able to choose the kind of telephone one wants which is a choice one did not have years ago <e> <s> your lordships already have an example of that in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords not in detail <e> <s> that is obviously a matter for british telecom <e> <s> however i understand that they are investing an enormous amount in new exchanges and once they are in place they will be able to give more detail on the accounts <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i indicated to my noble friend lord orr-ewing that while the director general of oftel had said that the price increases were in line with the requirements of the licence he had made other remarks to british telecom about exactly what the noble baroness has just said <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a completely different question the answer to which is that the noble lord will have to wait and see when the bill comes before the house <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to my noble friends first question my right honourable friend the secretary of state will be well aware of them but i shall certainly make a point of drawing his attention to these remarks <e> <s> the answer to my noble friends second question is no <e>", "<cs> my lords oftel is the office of telecommunications <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the programme failed to state that action had already been taken by the government in some of the cases mentioned <e> <s> in others it is under consideration <e> <s> as far as changes in the law and the regulation of financial institutions are concerned the government have published a white paper and will be introducing legislation during the present session <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously i would ask the noble lord to await the arrival of the legislation <e> <s> however i would not agree with him that self-regulation is an unsatisfactory procedure <e> <s> perhaps i may inform the noble lord that in certain of the cases mentioned in the television programme action has been taken <e> <s> the secretary of state was instrumental in the compulsory winding-up of one of the companies involved and three of the leading characters have been extradited to germany and face <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite correct <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has not given a specific example so

extremely well <e> <s> on the question of suspense accounts i should remind my noble friend that the licensed dealers conduct of business rules which came into force after the events described in this particular programme require transactions to be booked to a named client on the day they are made <e>", "<cs> my lords the department is naturally concerned about that and in certain lloyds cases police and departmental inquiries are still continuing and i cannot make any further comment on them at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i should be unwise to comment too strongly on my noble friends opinion of the programme panorama in general terms <e> <s> however i think it is unfortunate that in this particular case they did not tell the whole story <e>", "<cs> my lords that is just simply not true <e> <s> if an individual breaks the rules of the organisation of which he is a member obviously he will be dealt with by the organisation <e> <s> if he breaks the criminal law the full force of the law will come down upon him <e>", "<cs> my lords until recently two unauthorised marine broadcasting stations laser and radio caroline were operating from panamanian-registered vessels

was situated sailed into harwich <e> <s> radio caroline continues to broadcast <e>", "<cs> my lords since the laser vessel was escorted into harwich it has been detained under a writ served by the admiralty marshal and an injunction served in connection with private claims against the shipowners <e> <s> the vessel is also being detained by department of transport marine surveyors because of deficiencies in its equipment <e> <s> in addition to that there are further deficiencies which give cause for concern to the government of panama <e> <s> the government have no power to detain the

non-operational <e> <s> an international calling and distress frequency on north foreland radio was on one occasion completely blocked out <e> <s> furthermore the stations have also interfered with the reception of authorised broadcasting stations in west germany and the republic of ireland which use the same frequency <e> <s> in addition they have meant that it has not been possible to bring in the planned frequency for bbc radio essex <e>", "<cs> my lords we are discussing the question with representatives of the panamanian government <e> <s> that is the flag state under which the vessel is registered <e> <s> i can say no more about that at present <e> <s> however i would point out that it is an offence either to supply the vessel or to advertise on the radio <e> <s> we have a vessel

this debate this afternoon <e> <s> although his motion refers to a reply given by my noble friend lord gowrie to the noble lord on rd july as he has said it in fact goes back to a question which the noble lord asked me on th june and which i attempted to answer <e> <s> i am aware that the answers i gave on that day <e>", "<cs> my lords i hoped i had already covered that when i said that we would

the amount of money i specified of million is subject to the project receiving consent so if the project did not receive consent that money would not be spent <e> <s> on the other point that the noble lord mentioned that is the enormous sums of money and the concern that it could be wasted it is inevitable in such situations that where any company is going for a contract some money will be spent on

<s> i can tell the noble lord that it is possible that proposals will be put forward in due course which will permit them to be sold generally and if that happens we would agree but at the moment there does not appear to be much demand for that size <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that should such a demand materialise we will do our best to accommodate it <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord would rather have half a bottle and that is permitted not that i am offering <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house do now adjourn during pleasure until eight oclock <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the cosmetic products safety amendment regulations which were laid before the house on th november be approved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for his welcome of this order <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his general reception of the order <e> <s> we have consulted the industry and suppliers and they should be fully aware of the terms of this order <e> <s> therefore we expect them to comply with it as from the date i mentioned <e> <s> it will of course be for the trading standards officers to enforce the order <e> <s> i have outlined how that takes place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord bruce of donington and the noble viscount lord hanworth for their contributions to the debate on these regulations <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce of donington and to some extent the noble viscount said that consumer interests should be dominant in these matters <e> <s> of course we take a considerable amount of advice from the consumer associations <e> <s> indeed they have a very important role to play <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount is quite right and i am glad that he has pointed out that most of the problems come from imported goods rather than from domestically produced goods <e> <s> i certainly take note of what he says <e> <s> the customs and excise have powers and i know that they do their best to stop the importation of this kind of merchandise <e>", "<cs> my lords i take note of what the noble lord says <e> <s> i draw his attention once more to the white paper on the sale of goods which proposes new powers to seize and detain unsafe goods <e> <s> i take the point that he is making about the numbers of customs officers <e> <s> i cannot give him the figures at the moment <e> <s> the white paper proposes that the customs and excise should be given powers to supply details of imports to the enforcement authorities <e> <s> we must hope that we can find time to legislate on the white paper as soon as posible <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft pushchairs safety amendment regulations laid before the house on th november be approved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord bruce for his welcome to the regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords pay for everyone including these groups should depend on what their employers can afford and what is necessary to recruit retain and motivate staff of the right calibre to do the work effectively <e>", "<cs> my lords what we are interested in is not low pay but low unit costs <e> <s> therefore if a company or employees of that company can justify salary increases through increased productivity and profitability that is all well and good <e> <s> as regards the workers for whom the government are responsible the top salaries review board reported and its recommendations have been taken into account in stages <e> <s> the top salary review board was started in and it has been the policy of successive governments since that time to apply its recommendations <e>", "<cs> my lords real wage increases will destroy jobs and real improvements in productivity will increase jobs <e> <s> a per cent <e> <s> change in the average level of real earnings will the treasury estimates in time make a difference of up to per cent <e> <s> in the number employed <e> <s> as regards the people whom the government employ obviously as i said in my original answer we must take into account what is necessary to recruit retain and motivate those staff <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the teachers dispute is somewhat outside the terms of the question on the order paper and it is certainly not something into which at the present time while the two sides are at acas i would wish to be drawn <e>", "<cs> my lords i tend to agree with my noble friend in much of what he says <e> <s> of course many of these increases are as a result of links to the profitability of the companies involved <e> <s> in those cases i should have thought that it is the shareholders of those companies who must decide whether their managements are being properly rewarded <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is quite right when she mentions the very high salaries which are being paid at the moment in the city of london <e> <s> i think that this could be covered <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not what i have tried to say in my replies at all <e> <s> i have made it quite clear that the government would like to see lower unit costs throughout industry and through that an increase in profitability and productivity and through that an increase in jobs <e> <s> as i have said it is the responsibility of the companies themselves to decide whether it is worth giving their top employees large salary increases and what effect it will have upon the rest of their workforce <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> i would also say as i said to my noble friend lord nugent that a lot of these increases are of course linked directly to the profitability of the companies concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords this governments record in encouraging profit-sharing schemes and employee share ownership is second to none <e> <s> i believe that at the time when we came into office in there were about companies with employee share ownership schemes and i think i am right in saying that there are now about <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i have already made clear what the governments views are on this matter <e> <s> as regards the salaries for which the government are responsible they must of course be limited to what the taxpayer can afford and if one pays more than the rate of inflation then inflation will continue to go up <e>", "<cs> my lords the last public expenditure white paper showed total public sector capital spending of billion in the plans for <e> <s> the estimated outturn for the year will be shown in the public expenditure white paper to be published later today <e> <s> it is not possible to link particular forms of public spending such as capital investment directly with particular forms of finance <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been the policy of successive governments for as long as history goes back perhaps not to hypothecate capital and current expenditure <e> <s> however if one looks through the budget statement one can quickly see the total amounts of money which have been raised from the various items about which the noble lord asks in his question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for giving me the date when this started <e>", "<cs> my lords in case in my original answer i gave support to the party of the noble lord opposite i shall have to read carefully what i said and perhaps correct myself <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said we have to look at the budget as a whole <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes to do that over the years since this party has been in office he will find that the amount of fixed public capital investment has exceeded the receipts of privatisation some times <e>", "<cs> not without notice my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords official price indices for these groups are not available <e>", "<cs> my lords i have indeed seen the ifs study not the full study but a rsum of it <e> <s> the government are guided in these matters by the independent retail prices index advisory committee which is a body independent of the government <e> <s> that committee has said in the past that no indices for any other special social or income groups should be published <e> <s> however i have no doubt that the study has been noted by the committee <e> <s> as to whether the burden of inflation is greater on the lower decile of income earners i must point out that the study showed in fact that the difference was very small only in the region of about one-third of per cent <e> <s> a year <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree with my noble friend that inflation is bad for the nation <e> <s> whether it impinges more heavily on one group or another is as i have said very marginal and it has been the recommendation of the prices index advisory committee that we should only publish the main rpi <e>", "<cs> my lords no i would not agree that the burden of inflation has been significantly greater <e> <s> i have already given the figure quoted in the study and that works out at one-third of per cent <e> <s> per year <e> <s> i do not consider that to be very much <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutley right <e> <s> i would go on to say that regarding the up-rating of pensions in the past year alone pensions have risen by per cent <e> <s> more than inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> the main differences are for those people who smoke heavily and drink heavily <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i have already answered the second part of the question <e> <s> i have said that the matter is one for the independent advisory committee and they will no doubt have noted this study <e> <s> if they make any recommendations to the government as a result of that we shall of course take them into account <e> <s> with regard to the increase in pensions i do not have at hand the figures which the noble lord lord hatch has quoted i quote my own figures of a per cent <e> <s> real increase in the past months <e> <s> that is based on the retail price index specifically for pensioners <e> <s> as i said earlier an index for pensioners is calculated <e>", "<cs> my lords the pensioners index at the moment is running slightly lower than the ordinary rpi <e> <s> whether they can or cannot avail themselves of some of the benefits of the higher decile of earnings is not really a matter in the calculation of the index <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble lord lord gallacher for having raised this important matter in debate today and i am most grateful to be given the opportunity to discuss a subject which is so central to the governments policies that of competition <e> <s> at the basis of our policy on monopolies and mergers is the conviction that free competition in the market place is the most effective way to keep prices down to satisfy the consumer and to promote efficiency in production and <e>", "<cs> certainly my lords <e> <s> i have a note on the westland situation and i shall reply to the noble lord before i come to the end of my speech <e>", "<cs> my lords at th january million coins had been issued <e> <s> of these million featured a scottish design and million a welsh design <e>", "<cs> my lords there is to be issued in commemoration of the commonwealth games to be held in edinburgh this year a coin which will be a commemorative piece <e> <s> the government have no intention of issuing a coin for general circulation <e>", "<cs> my lords i think all coins are considered together when changes are made <e> <s> so far as i know there is no consideration to redesign the p coin at the moment <e> <s> it should not be that easy to confuse it with the coin because the coin is probably nearly twice as thick as the p coin <e> <s> also of course it is of a different colour <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i do not have an answer to the noble lords question <e> <s> whether or not such a figure is in fact kept i shall endeavour to find out and perhaps if i may i will write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> not so far as i know at the moment my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that this could have caused a problem but on the other side of the coin if i may so put it as far as street collections for charity are concerned i think people are more likely to put a coin into the box than they would have been to have put a note in <e>", "<cs> my lords the structure of the coinage is kept under constant review <e> <s> nottingham university have been commissioned by the royal mint to look at various changes to our coinage system <e>", "<cs> my lords far be it from me to say that the coinage is entirely satisfactory at the moment <e> <s> i quite agree with the noble lord that it is probably not <e> <s> but as i have said there is research going on at the moment into possible changes <e> <s> various options including i may say no change are under consideration and especially involving the possible replacement of the p and p pieces <e> <s> i must tell noble lords that research is at an early stage and is so far inconclusive <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say first that this research which is being undertaken by nottingham university particularly includes the blind the partially sighted and the handicapped when they are considering this problem <e> <s> so far as concerns the coin and the p coin i think that the p coin has on the whole been extremely popular in its introduction <e> <s> as regards the coin i know that we <e>", "<cs> no my lords i would not accept that <e> <s> i think that the difference between the coin and the note apart from the fact that it is fairly commonplace in other countries in the world is a reasonable difference <e> <s> there is i suppose a possibility that at some stage a coin may be looked into but at the moment i would not give any further encouragement than that <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly hope that those involved in this research will take note of what is said in your lordships house this afternoon <e> <s> i have to tell the noble lord lord obrien and i recall the debate very well that the cost of completely revising the coinage would be something in the order of million to the mint alone and that would not take into account the cost to other people such as banks vending machine operators and the general public <e> <s> in addition it would be quite a major step for people in the community to accept and particularly if i may say so the type of people to whom my noble friend lord broxbourne referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the scots are very keen on their notes <e> <s> they are legal tender in scotland and are widely accepted in england as well <e> <s> i hope that the scots may be quite happy with the coin which they had issued the year before last <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the research mainly consists of human performance tests with members of the public particularly including the blind the partially sighted and the handicapped <e> <s> of course views of the public are noted as well because the research may result in some sort of conclusion but it would be up to my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer to decide at the end of the day what changes might or might not be needed <e> <s> therefore we would of course take into account the views of members of the public <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure how i should answer that <e> <s> if the noble lord would like me to arrange for a free handout of the different coins i am not sure that i could arrange that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite sure that the noble earl is better informed on this matter than i am <e> <s> i have to say as i have said to the noble lord lord obrien that a complete change would be very impractical and therefore we must try to make gradual changes as and when they prove necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i know there are various possibilities regarding the shape of coins <e> <s> the royal mint coin collectors club magazine last year published an article about possible changes to the coins which included for instance a p piece shaped rather like the old threepenny bit used to be <e> <s> that is one option and i understand that they are looking into that kind of change <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the possibility of a hole in the middle of a coin has <e>", "<cs> my lords as i already mentioned to the noble baroness lady seear there was an article in the magazine of the royal mint coin collectors club which gave various options that might or might not be suggested for a change <e> <s> i do not agree with my noble friend that colour and shape are of no use whatsoever <e> <s> i think that in a coinage such as ours you do have to have different colours and you probably have to have different shapes as well <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the aims of the government during energy efficiency year is to bring about improved energy efficiency in public buildings <e> <s> energy managers are being appointed throughout the government estate and the rest of the public sector and their task is to keep energy consumption within standards appropriate to the buildings for which they are responsible <e> <s> they will pay attention to heating control systems and like everyone else will be governed by the provisions of the fuel and electricity heating control amendment order <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indeed doing our best through energy efficiency year to make that point as clear as possible and my noble friend may have seen the estimates that some billion a year could be saved in energy consumption <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that this building is the responsibility of the property services agency <e> <s> there is in fact an energy efficiency officer i think that is the designation with responsibility for the building and i must sympathise with him because i cannot believe that he can have an easy job to do in this building <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the best that i can say to my noble friend is that i shall certainly draw his remarks to the attention of the appropriate authority <e>", "<cs> no my lords so far as energy conservation is concerned local authorities obtain considerable assistance from the department <e> <s> i believe that the amount of money that could be saved by local authorities is estimated to be in the region of million a year as calculated by the audit commission <e> <s> through the audit commission we have helped local authorities to develop guidelines and train their auditors in energy value-for-money audit <e> <s> we have designed a special monitoring and targeting programme for them and by the end of this year virtually all local authorities in england and wales will have their energy use assessed against proper yardsticks <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have an answer to that particular question at the moment but i shall look into it and perhaps write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that is a question for me to answer in this chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with everything that my noble friend has said <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend may well be right but i am not a doctor <e>", "<cs> my lords we find ourselves in a slight difficulty in that we are due to resume consideration of the shops bill at a quarter-past eight and it is now only fourteen minutes past <e> <s> whether i should attempt to speak for another minute which i might find difficult at this stage or whether i should adjourn the house during pleasure for <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord tordoff <e> <s> we have now probably almost reached the stage when we can continue consideration of the shops bill on report <e>", "<cs> my lords the coal industry is making a magnificent recovery following the miners strike with output and productivity levels exceeding expectations for the year <e>", "<cs> my lords this government have invested nearly billion at september prices in the coal industry since <e> <s> that is per cent <e> <s> higher in real terms than in the preceding five years under the labour government <e> <s> as to productivity the latest figures available for december show record levels of over tonnes per shift higher than has ever been achieved before <e> <s> i understand that in the previous years to which my noble friend referred productivity actually fell marginally <e>", "<cs> my lords that is primarily a matter for negotiation between the national coal board and the central electricity generating board in the first instance <e> <s> it is too early to be certain how long these low oil prices will remain and until we have a clearer idea of that i think that we shall have to wait and see <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the latter part of my noble friends question i do not have with me a figure of the coal price per therm <e> <s> however in answer to the first part of my noble friends question i can say that the output now is very nearly the same as it was in with a reduction in the workforce of some people <e>", "<cs> my lords yes indeed we should be pleased by that <e> <s> i should be happy to put down a summary of the output by region <e> <s> perhaps if the noble lord would put that down in the form of a written question i could provide him with those figures <e>", "<cs> my lords yes indeed <e> <s> i congratulate the two pits in kent for having achieved this per cent <e> <s> output improvement between september and november <e> <s> the area still faces problems in achieving profitability but as my noble friend reminds us they have been reprieved from closure at any rate for the time being <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lord i think i said earlier that with the fall in oil prices although it was too early to tell what the impact of those would be it is obviously essential that productivity should continue to increase in the coal industry if coal is to remain competitive with other forms of energy <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord would agree that lower energy prices for our industry would be a most valuable contribution to the economic performance of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that goes a little wide of the question <e> <s> of course the salaries or wages of coalminers include quite a reasonable element of productivity bonus in them <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to my noble friend i am afraid that i do not have comparative figures for overseas countries <e> <s> i shall endeavour to find out if such figures exist and perhaps write to my noble friend if those figures are comparable at all <e>", "<cs> my lords yes indeed <e> <s> i hope that the import of coal will be able to be reduced if our own mining industry is mining very much more <e> <s> regarding the future closure of pits it is inevitable that pits cannot go on for ever <e> <s> at the same time that we are closing pits we are also investing large amounts of money in opening new ones <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join other noble lords in thanking the noble baroness lady serota for introducing this important subject for debate this afternoon <e> <s> it may be of interest to your lordships to know that these issues are also being debated elsewhere today <e> <s> the european commission is itself holding a conference near oxford on the memorandum on income tax and equal treatment so it is indeed a topical subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to tell my noble friend that in the past fortnight we have issued full advice on winter driving to newspaper feature writers and as part of our wider programme <e>", "<cs> my lords we draw the attention of people to the need to keep their lights clean at all times and in good working order <e> <s> this year we shall be sending a little reminder leaflet out with peoples vehicle excise duty reminder forms therefore it will go to some million people concerning the use of lights on cars <e> <s> with regard to the second part of my noble friends question there are mixed views about the use of hazard warning lights on moving vehicles <e> <s> the use on the move is at present prohibited under the road vehicle lighting regulations <e> <s> it is a definite point that to be effective hazard lights should be used sensibly and sparingly <e> <s> there is a risk of overuse and their misuse could lead to confusion to other motorists <e>", "<cs> my lords yes that is against the law <e> <s> this is one of the features to be included in the little leaflet which will be sent to all those renewing their tax discs this year <e> <s> it states <e>", "<cs> my lords yes the department is considering that proposal at the <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may deal with the second of the noble lords questions i am not sure how wide an exposure the information receives but i hope that as a result of the briefing advice that we have sent to all motoring and transport correspondents with suggestions as to what they might include both in articles that are written and presumably radio broadcasts our suggestions will be heeded <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble lord lord barnett for having <e>", "<cs> my lords i have said what we intend to do which is to leave production as it is at the moment <e> <s> i was referring to those who spoke about the possibility of us joining the european monetary system <e> <s> the noble lord lord barnett said that to join was not a matter of political ideology it was a decision to be taken on hard practical grounds <e> <s> i could not agree more <e> <s> indeed if noble lords look at the speech of my right honourable friend the economic secretary on th january in another place they will see that he used virtually the same words the governments position is unchanged it is a matter we keep under continual review <e>", "<cs> my lords it has indeed come down and it must come down more in this country <e> <s> the noble lord lord kaldor and many other noble lords including the noble lord lord parry also spoke about our manufacturing base <e> <s> the house of lords committee on overseas trade said that our manufacturing base was so weak that it could not fill the gap when the oil ran out and various noble lords this afternoon have echoed that sentiment including particularly the noble lord lord hatch <e> <s> however that is to ignore the facts <e>", "<cs> my lords it is perfectly true to say that between and there was a dramatic fall <e> <s> the noble lord has probably forgotten that we had an oil crisis at that time when the price of oil doubled or was it trebled <e> <s> i cannot remember <e> <s> that recession took place all over the rest of the world as well <e> <s> it certainly was not only in this country <e> <s> output also declined under labour <e> <s> as i remarked earlier it has revived rapidly since <e> <s> i would rather look to the future and see what is happening now than continually go back to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not going to give way again <e> <s> i have given way often enough as it is <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord diamond is talking about unit costs <e> <s> they have gone up compared with our competitors and those were the figures that i was talking about when i urged restraint on wage settlements <e> <s> that is not the same as productivity <e> <s> productivity has risen by the figures that i mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects on behalf of my noble friend lord lucas of chilworth i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords the overall savings we look for can be achieved by a variety of means <e> <s> a substantial proportion can be achieved simply through better management and with little or no investment <e> <s> the rest of the savings perhaps just over half require investments with a relatively short payback period <e> <s> given payback periods ranging from a few weeks to five years an associated investment of some billion to billion might be required <e>", "<cs> my lords i can certainly give the noble lord the assurance that the momentum will be sustained as it has been for the last two years beyond the end of energy efficiency year <e> <s> to some extent i think that the momentum will be self-feeding as more and more industries discover the benefits that some of their competitors have received from an energy efficiency campaign and will naturally want to keep up with them <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the latter part of the question of the noble baroness may i say that i am sorry that this should have happened <e> <s> i imagine that this scheme is part of the voluntary insulation scheme which is funded partly by the department of energy partly by the dhss and partly by the manpower services commission <e> <s> i must say that i am disappointed to hear that such a scheme should have been held up because of red tape <e> <s> as regards the question of home insulation the government are still giving grants for that work <e> <s> a normal grant of per cent <e> <s> can be paid to householders up to a maximum of and over million grants of this kind have been paid to date <e> <s> for the elderly and the disabled a per cent <e> <s> grant of up to is payable and over such grants have been made <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope i made it quite clear that we do indeed have a sustained energy saving campaign <e> <s> i cannot confirm the figure for the number of jobs that could be created through this other than to add to what i said to the noble baroness that the voluntary insulation scheme so far has created jobs in projects of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite correct <e> <s> indeed all the suppliers of energy the gas boards the electricity boards and the oil companies have been supporting the government by mounting energy efficiency campaigns and by pointing out to consumers how best they can save money <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the prime minister chaired a seminar organised by the better made in britain campaign last month <e> <s> my noble friend lord young of graffham is to open the third better made in britain exhibition on th march <e> <s> the think british campaign is discussing with the department of trade and industry ways of promoting british goods which are of good quality and well designed <e>", "<cs> my lords yes indeed import substitution is a valuable aim just as much as exports <e> <s> however the government have to remember that by reason of our obligations under the treaty of rome i think that it is article we have to be careful when giving financial support to such action <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that per cent <e> <s> of the goods and services bought by the government in any case are from united kingdom sources <e> <s> as to the purchasing policies of recently privatised companies that must be a matter for them <e> <s> one would hope that british companies can and will produce satisfactory goods for them to buy <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am seriously suggesting that <e> <s> i would certainly say that to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree with the noble lord <e> <s> i am also aware that he is a member of i think it is the council of the think british campaign <e> <s> we would agree entirely with what he said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am interested in what the noble lord says about the origins of this campaign <e> <s> at the end of the day so long as british industry can produce goods at a price and of a specification that people want which it is now in a very good position to be able to do then people should think carefully before choosing foreign imports <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to my noble friends first question i am afraid that i do not have comparative figures of imports by other countries <e> <s> as to motor cars my noble friend will no doubt be aware that the import penetration of the private car market is something over per cent <e> <s> at the moment <e> <s> it is obviously up to british manufacturers to produce cars that people want to buy <e> <s> at the end of the day it must be for people to decide how to spend their own money and not be dictated to by the government <e> <s> in any case the government are in no position to do that dictating <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already answered i believe the question that the noble lord put to me in saying that government purchases are per cent <e> <s> british <e> <s> if the noble lord is trying to imply that overseas companies which manufacture goods in britain are not welcome here he should think again <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has i believe a good point <e> <s> as to how i should go about it i am not sure but certainly i take note of what the noble lord says <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount asks me a couple of specific questions which at the moment i am afraid i cannot answer <e> <s> i would however say in general terms that the development and production of a range of goods receive quite a lot of support from the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i have not tried to be totally nationalistic in my approach to this question <e> <s> i have said that we would wish obviously to encourage people to buy british where the product is competitive where it is priced right and where the quality is up to scratch <e> <s> but as i have already said it is up to people to spend their money how they wish <e> <s> if they happen to choose british goods the more the better <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has a very good point <e> <s> so far as the promotion of british goods is concerned the think british campaign has i gather a label which can be attached to goods <e> <s> noble lords should also look out for articles with the design council label on them <e>", "<cs> my lords this is indeed a matter to which the government give thought <e> <s> that is why we are in close touch with both organisations the better made in britain campaign and the think british campaign <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness will know these measures were not among those referred to in the queens speech for inclusion in this sessions legislative programme <e> <s> however the government remain committed to introducing this legislation as soon as parliamentary time is available <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the concern that the noble baroness expresses <e> <s> as i hoped to indicate in my original answer the government too share that concern <e> <s> as the noble baroness will be aware there are many pressures on the parliamentary timetable <e> <s> the government are fully seized of the importance of this matter and hope that the necessary legislation will not be long delayed particularly as other pressing matters of consumer safety and price indications are also involved in this possible legislation <e> <s> the remarks made by my honourable friend in the committee in another place refer to this proposed legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords that is exactly the purpose of the legislation that we hope to be able to bring in as soon as possible <e> <s> i would give perhaps two small crumbs of comfort to the noble baroness <e> <s> as from the new tariffs being introduced next month in april the daily availability charge will be fixed as a maximum the same as an ordinary domestic consumer would have to pay and the maximum tariff chargeable will also be fixed the same as an ordinary consumer would have to pay in most of the electricity boards <e>", "<cs> my lords i can certainly give the noble lord that assurance <e> <s> the reference which he makes to what was said by the spokesman from the department of energy refers to legislation which will be promoted i hope by the department of trade and industry <e> <s> as i am a spokesman for both departments in your lordships house i can assure the noble lord that that is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of standing charges is a slightly different matter in that the proposed legislation refers to the passing-on if i may put it that way of the standing charge from the landlord to the tenant <e> <s> i am not quite sure from where the noble lord gets the sum of a week for standing charges <e> <s> my understanding is that the highest sum for standing charges in any of the electricity board areas is somewhere in the region of a quarter <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case i think that it really is a very different question altogether <e>", "<cs> my lords i remind the noble baroness that the report of the director general of fair trading was only published in june last year <e> <s> it takes a certain amount of time to translate the director generals recommendation into legislation and as i have said there are other matters also involved in the possible legislation <e> <s> i am aware of the concern expressed by the noble baroness <e> <s> however as she will be aware there is a good deal of advertising going on at the moment <e> <s> moreover there are existing rules as well and this will only be an improvement on the existing rules <e> <s> there is quite a considerable campaign of advertising and there will be more advertising following the new tariff arrangement which will take place next month <e> <s> it is hoped that that will draw peoples attention to the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have undertaken in another place to bring forward an amendment to the financial services bill on this matter <e> <s> the amendment would give the secretary of state a power to direct a self-regulating organisation to alter its rules <e> <s> the secretary of state would be able to transfer this power to a designated agency <e> <s> the power would be exercisable if the organisations rules did not afford to investors protection at least equivalent to that afforded by rules made by the secretary of state or designated agency as appropriate <e> <s> the precise form of this amendment is still under consideration in consultation with interested parties <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble earl says that it is attracting a great deal of interest in another place he is of course quite right <e> <s> in fact it has not even finished its committee stage there it still has to go through the remaining stages <e> <s> perhaps i would not be out of order in suggesting that we in your lordships house should really wait and see what the bill looks like when it arrives here at second reading and i have no doubt that there will then be ample opportunity for all these points to be raised at that stage and subsequent stages <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord lord ezra that is a matter which must <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord teviot reminded us the last time i answered an unstarred question of his was some months ago on the <e>", "<cs> my lords the available evidence suggests that between and companies account for about one half of uk exports of goods and that this has changed little in recent years <e> <s> on the last survey available to me the top seven companies all exported more than billion worth of goods <e> <s> of the top exporting companies about one-third exported more than half their turnover <e>", "<cs> my lords i would agree with my noble friend that small companies also have a very valuable part to play in this and the government assist through the exports to europe branch for instance which was set up to help firms in their exporting to the european community and the rest of western europe <e> <s> the british overseas trade board diplomatic posts overseas and the export credits guarantee department also provide a wide range of services to exporters <e> <s> it should not be forgotten that non-government sources also assist in the form of trade associations and of course the banks <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will be aware that membership of the ems is continually under review <e> <s> i think that as recently as his budget speech my right honourable friend the chancellor said that he did not feel the time was quite right at the moment to do so but that indeed the situation was being kept under review <e>", "<cs> my lords i would agree <e> <s> but on the other hand had we joined three years ago when it was first suggested we would have joined on considerably worse terms than might be

donington i shall be having rather more to say about it <e> <s> perhaps i should reserve my remarks until then <e>", "<cs> my lords invisible balances indeed give us an extremely favourable balance of payments surplus <e> <s> in there was a surplus on invisibles of some billion <e> <s> for the first two months of this year there has been a balance of billion <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have figures for the resources available to the british overseas trade board at hand <e> <s> if i can find the answer to the noble lords question i shall write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bruce of donington has mentioned three key <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> i have every intention of trying to deal with as many points as i possibly can when i come to wind up <e> <s> if the noble lord recalls i think that he will realise it is normal form for the government to set out their case at the beginning of the debate and when the minister comes to wind up to attempt to answer as many points as possible <e> <s> that is what i shall try to do <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now attempt to answer some of the points made during the most interesting debate of the noble lord lord bruce <e> <s> i echo the thanks of all those who have said how grateful we are to the noble lord for raising this subject <e> <s> the noble lord referred to the report of the select committee on overseas trade of this house on the deficit in trade in manufactures <e> <s> my noble friend lord young of graffham said in this house when we debated the report that the government welcomed many of its recommendations <e> <s> but the government believe it is important to ensure that the whole economys competitiveness is able to adapt and not just that of manufacturing industry <e> <s> the government accept the need for an efficient manufacturing industry <e> <s> but a policy of selective support and substituting the judgment of government for that of the market is not the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i can understand japans figures being better than ours because japan is a rather richer country <e> <s> i shall certainly look into the figures which the noble lord has mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that such an experiment is going on i think in liverpool but without checking my facts i could not confirm that <e> <s> the noble lord has a good point <e> <s> it has indeed generated a terrific amount of interest and investment <e>", "<cs> a rate of increase that is exactly what i am trying to say <e> <s> they were up per cent <e> <s> year on year which is however a smaller rise than they had last year <e> <s> the noble lord pointed out the difference between manufacturers costs which were actually down per cent <e> <s> over the period and the increase in earnings <e> <s> i think those figures all tell the same story <e>", "<cs> my lords there are powers in the companies act to investigate the affairs of companies <e> <s> however the police are already making inquiries into various allegations concerning the greater london enterprise board and i see no reason for exercise of those powers at present <e> <s> the situation is being kept under review and any further information my noble friend has about the greater london enterprise board will be considered <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to my noble friends first supplementary i gather that police inquiries are well advanced and that there has already been one successful prosecution <e> <s> as regards the future ownership of the greater london enterprise board it is a matter for the boroughs themselves to decide whether or not to join <e> <s> i gather that so far out of london boroughs have decided to become members and that a further six are considering their position <e> <s> it is of course up to them then to take an interest in what happens <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of the particular figures that my noble friend has quoted <e> <s> but it is now of course a matter for the london boroughs to decide whether or not they want to continue with this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not entirely sure what relationship the housing associations have with the greater london enterprise board <e> <s> the question relates to the greater london enterprise board <e> <s> i do not have at the moment any information regarding the housing associations <e>", "<cs> my lords i said in my original answer that the police were investigating matters concerning the greater london enterprise board <e> <s> of course there is a world of difference between fraudulent activity and plain incompetence <e> <s> i did say that i would take note of any further information that we received on the greater london enterprise board in deciding whether we should investigate under the companies act <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mellish makes a good point but the question relates of course to the financial affairs of the greater london enterprise board <e> <s> i am sure that the successor boroughs to the greater london council will take note of what the noble lord has said in deciding whether or not they wish to continue with the greater london enterprise board <e>", "<cs> my lords i can say clearly as i hope i have made clear that the future of the enterprise board is now a matter for the london boroughs <e> <s> since the abolition of the glc it is right and proper that those boroughs should have the right to make their own decision about this sort of matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not entirely sure of the extent to which my right honourable friend has urged the london boroughs to join the greater london enterprise board <e> <s> my noble friend lord elton in a statement last month when he refused the application of the glc to give a further million to the greater london enterprise board made clear that it was a matter for the boroughs to decide <e> <s> as i said earlier only of the boroughs have so far decided to become members <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect the noble lord is i think slightly confused as between the greater london enterprise board and the residuary body <e> <s> the greater london enterprise board has been in existence for a number of years and was set up by the glc <e>", "<cs> my lords as to whether i should give advice to the london boroughs on joining the greater london enterprise board i feel that we spent an enormous amount of time last year on the abolition bill specifically to give powers of this sort to the boroughs to make up their own minds about what they should do <e> <s> as regards the interest-free loan that haringey has given to the greater london enterprise board i am not entirely sure of the details <e> <s> i understand that the company did change its articles of association in order to allow london boroughs to take over control on payment of each <e> <s> it may be that this is the in question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am looking again at the question on the order paper <e> <s> i fail to see any connection between the question which the noble lord lord sefton has asked me and that on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i made clear in my original answer that we have powers under the companies act to investigate such affairs <e> <s> we have decided at the moment that we can see no reason to do so because the police are investigating certain allegations <e> <s> the police have not asked us for help at this stage <e> <s> if they were to do so we should stand ready to assist <e> <s> that is as far as i can go on this subject this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords the government consider that the british fashion industry has an important role to play in contributing to the prosperity of the british textile industry as a whole <e> <s> we have therefore encouraged the british fashion council to pursue its activities in co-ordinating the promotion of british fashion <e> <s> we are currently considering a report which we commissioned from the british clothing industry association on the future role of the british fashion council <e> <s> government receptions have been held at lancaster house and no <e> <s> downing street for overseas buyers media representatives and uk designers participating in five successive british fashion weeks <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very happy indeed to agree with my noble friend and to pay tribute to the success of the british fashion industry and wish it continuing success <e>", "<cs> my lords i can tell the noble lord that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for trade and industry is announcing or has announced this afternoon that he intends within the next few months to introduce a million scheme to help centres of higher and further education to buy advanced textile and clothing machinery <e> <s> although all institutions running appropriate courses will be eligible to apply we intend to concentrate assistance upon those universities polytechnics and colleges that provide a particularly wide range of education in this area <e> <s> the rate of grant will be per cent <e> <s> of equipment costs <e> <s> i think that that gives the lie to the suggestion that we are running down education in this area <e>", "<cs> my lords i have just informed the house of the extra money which is being made available for equipment and so on <e> <s> i have no doubt that the polytechnic to which the noble lord refers with the reputation that he says it has must be in the forefront for being granted some of this money <e>", "<cs> my lords we give considerable support to the clothing industry in export schemes <e> <s> the budget of the british overseas trade board in was million <e> <s> that is very high in comparison with other industries <e> <s> we have helped to organise or promote as i said at the beginning a lot of shows here and also helped exporters to exhibit at shows overseas <e>", "<cs> my lords the figure of million which i mentioned earlier is new money for colleges and centres of higher education to buy advanced textile and clothing machinery <e> <s> at the moment i am not aware of the total figure given in the education field <e> <s> this money i mentioned is new money <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my original answer we are certainly not trying to interfere <e> <s> we are trying to assist where we can in the promotion of british fashion week and that kind of thing <e> <s> i would not have called that interference <e> <s> i hope that that will be regarded in a positive light <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not entirely aware of how the money available to polytechnics is divided up but if polytechnics receive grants to buy advanced textiles and clothing machinery i should have thought it would be unwise if they did not allocate within their budgets the amount of money to allow the students to use the machinery <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite correct <e> <s> i understand that the princess of wales has taken part in one of these receptions to promote british fashion <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e> <s> i think that we have gone as far as we can this evening with this committee stage and we should return to it tomorrow <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until pm <e>", "<cs> we have reached a suitable moment i believe to take the statement <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> my lords the benefit to charities will depend on the public response to the budget proposals but it could be at least million next year and perhaps more <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the points made by my noble friend <e> <s> in particular i think she refers to the new payroll deduction scheme which could be a great success <e>", "<cs> my lords first let me say that i saw the letter in <e>", "<cs> my lords i take note of what my noble friend says and i shall indeed ask my right honourable friend to take those effects into account <e> <s> perhaps it would be convenient to write to the noble lord lord barnett with a copy to my noble friend giving a summary of the briefing which i received on todays letter in <e>", "<cs> no my lords it will be the net sum as the tax has been removed <e>", "<cs> my lords i must declare an interest too as an old harrovian and also as having a son down for harrow and i can give the noble earl that assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords the figure of million was the noble lord lord barnetts it was not mine <e> <s> the net worth to the charities is very much an estimate <e> <s> as i said in my original answer it depends on the response from the public <e> <s> but the actual exchequer cost on that sort of basis we estimate to be million <e> <s> on my noble friends other question about opening a pandoras box i believe that on the basis that the charitable payroll deduction scheme is limited to a year it is not likely to have the effect that my noble friend describes <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to look into the figure <e> <s> i am not quite sure what the million does refer to <e> <s> it certainly does not refer to any of the figures that i have before me <e>", "<cs> my lords i have said that i shall write a letter on the basis of the briefing <e> <s> naturally i shall place a copy in the library as is the normal practice <e>", "<cs> i think we have reached a suitable moment to take the statement <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> i hope that i can briefly give the noble lord the reassurance which he seeks <e> <s> i assure him that these amendments are not necessary <e> <s> i am advised that there can be no doubt that the bill as drafted will apply to the director equally on reappointment or on initial appointment <e> <s> thus under clause any appointment of the director is limited to a maximum of five years and under subsection any appointment of the director is subject to the terms of appointment under subsections and of the clause <e>", "<cs> my lords in moving that the house do now resume i suggest that we do not return to consideration in committee on the gas bill until pm <e>", "<cs> i think on all sides of the committee we are concerned that the director should have the necessary status to have authority in carrying out his functions but this cannot be achieved by reference to his pay and conditions alone <e> <s> as we have already indicated a number of considerations will be taken into account in appointing the director not least matters relevant to his experience in relation to his functions under the bill <e> <s> it is the governments intention that he should be appropriately rewarded <e> <s> there is nothing in the existing paragraphs and of schedule which prevents that <e> <s> as presently worded the paragraphs give us the necessary flexibility to determine what may be an appropriate salary <e>", "<cs> the government are certainly not trying to wriggle anywhere let alone further <e> <s> i can give the noble lord the answer for which he has been waiting having asked the question three times <e> <s> it is yes indeed the director of ofgas will be full time <e> <s> whether or not he will be allowed to hold any outside directorships i cannot say at this stage <e> <s> i suppose it might be said that if he does hold outside directorships he cannot possibly be full time <e> <s> i believe from all our considerations of the bill so far that it will be a -hour-a-day seven-day-a-week job but no doubt the noble lord will hold that against me <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord stoddart asked whether there was any relationship between the proposed salary of the director of ofgas and that of the chairman of british gas <e> <s> in addition the noble lord lord bruce of donington asked how much the chairman of british gas would receive after privatisation <e> <s> that of course would be entirely a matter for the shareholders of british gas <e> <s> i do not think that there is anything i can say on that point at the moment <e> <s> again i feel it necessary that there should be sufficient reward for the responsibilities that he now has and will take on <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord marshall of leeds for his explanation <e> <s> i am sorry that i fell for the invitation of the noble lord lord bruce of donington to discuss the salary of the chairman of the british gas corporation because after all we are discussing the possible salary of the director general of ofgas <e> <s> the noble lord made a point about relativity <e> <s> i have already said that i do not accept it as such <e> <s> i feel as the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe correctly said that we must have the flexibility necessary to ensure that we can get the right person to fulfil that important duty <e> <s> i therefore urge the committee not to accept the amendment moved by the noble lord lord diamond and tie the salary to that of a deputy secretary <e>", "<cs> if we ever reach clause i hope very much that somebody may be able to enlighten the noble lord <e> <s> but i am certainly holding out no promises at this stage <e>", "<cs> i have already answered the noble lords first question and as i said i do not know how much the new chairman of british gas plc will be receiving <e> <s> at the present time i think that the chairman of british gas gets in the region of a year <e> <s> i may be wrong and i do not have a copy of the annual report before me <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce of donington has and he will put me right if i am wrong <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord and i can assure him that all on this side of the committee hope to be here for a little while longer yet and that we are not panicking in any way <e>", "<cs> i think that is a question which the noble lord should address to the potential director general to see what terms he can negotiate with my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i said an advertisement had been placed as such <e> <s> i said that steps had been taken <e> <s> i cannot at this stage give any further information than i have already given <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for bringing this to the attention of the house <e> <s> i assure him that the amendment as drafted is not necessary <e> <s> it seeks to bring in another reference to the secretary of state and the treasury in relation to the determination of compensation when the director ceases to hold office <e> <s> but this is already provided for by the reference to <e>", "<cs> i certainly do not agree that the paragraph is meaningless <e> <s> i find myself in a certain amount of confusion over the amendment of the noble lord lord diamond because the noble lord has just read out to the committee how he would see the <e>", "<cs> i find myself in a little difficulty <e> <s> we have already discussed amendment no <e> <s> and the noble lord has withdrawn it <e> <s> we had a discussion on the aspect about consultation with the appropriate committee of each house of parliament <e> <s> i must suggest to the noble lord that i have answered amendment no <e> <s> as i see it on the marshalled list <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes to come back with an amendment at a later date in the form in which he would like to see it then perhaps we can have the opportunity of discussing that amendment then <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend lord birdwood for asking the question that has allowed us to hold this short debate on the governments plans for the development of gallium arsenide <e> <s> he addressed mainly three points the importance of the technology the lack of a widespread appreciation of its importance and the high cost of bringing the technology to the stage of profitable manufacture <e> <s> the points are well taken <e>", "<cs> my lords the budget statement contained a number of further measures to encourage wider share ownership <e> <s> direct share ownership by individuals will be stimulated by the introduction of the personal equity plan <e> <s> the rate of stamp duty on share purchases will be reduced from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> the finance bill contains several refinements to the existing all-employee share schemes including an extension of the schemes to worker co-operatives <e> <s> finally the government will continue to provide opportunities for new investors to purchase shares through the privatisation programme <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the personal equity plan consultations are taking place with interested parties and it is hoped to issue a draft prospectus very shortly <e> <s> regarding the national opinion poll commissioned by the treasury which showed that per cent <e> <s> of all adults now own shares it was a very large survey of over people <e>", "<cs> yes my lords of course there must always be a note of caution regarding investment in shares after all it will be risk capital <e> <s> but i think that to invest a little either each month or each year certainly should show dividends over the years <e>", "<cs> my lords i would indeed agree with my noble friend and i would perhaps refer to the business expansion scheme which no doubt she will be aware is to continue <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord shares the same view as the government that wealth should be spread more evenly <e> <s> that is why we are proposing these schemes and why we have been very successful in what we have done so far <e> <s> we hope to be more successful in the future in getting more people in this country to have a direct stake in british industry <e>", "<cs> certainly my lords i entirely agree with my noble friend <e> <s> any more involvement particularly through employee share ownership schemes which have increased from in to over now must relate to providing more employment <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all in regard to nationalised industries such as british gas i do not believe that anybody in the country has a real sense of direct ownership in them <e> <s> when the noble lord travels on a train to newcastle does he really believe that he owns a piece of that train <e> <s> it is not only a small number of people who will participate in share ownership through the privatisation programme <e> <s> as well as the individual shareholders there are many millions of others who participate through insurance schemes unit trusts or other investment plans <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are straying a little wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> at the moment as far as i know the government have no plans at this stage to denationalise any of the three forces to which the noble lord referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give the noble lord the assurance that when british gas is sold to the public <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps we should turn to that when we reach the relevant stage in the bill which we are now considering <e> <s> when british gas is privatised obviously there will be the maximum possible participation by small shareholders <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords natural radioactive material particularly scale and silt has been found in pipework on offshore oil and gas installations and on treatment vessels <e> <s> where the pipework is not removed onshore for decontamination the work of removal of the scale or silt is carried out under the ionising radiation regulations which require the work to be carried out under local rules within controlled areas and under specialist supervision to ensure that there is no risk to personnel safety <e> <s> as the radiation is of low specific activity there is virtually no risk external to the pipework or vessel nor is there any risk of pollution of the environment <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble viscount that the most stringent tests are carried out and that if the silt is mixed with water and as a slurry is discharged directly into the sea it has to be in conformity with the authorisation under the radioactive substances act <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has invited me to read the article in the <e>", "<cs> i shall be delighted to answer the query concerning paragraph <e> <s> it merely means that the gas consumers council must keep proper books as is perfectly normal in bodies of this nature <e> <s> it will ensure that the financial aims and priorities are established and that expenditure can be properly scrutinised <e>", "<cs> the short answer is no i cannot at this stage but perhaps i may write to the noble lord with the answer <e>", "<cs> certainly i agree to do that <e> <s> i am satisfied that what i have said outlines the nature of the duties which must be performed by the gas consumers council in keeping proper books and that kind of thing <e> <s> i have no reason to believe that any secretary of state could in fact order such matters as the noble lord has described <e> <s> i imagine that this particular paragraph represents standard practice but i shall certainly check to find out and make sure that i am right in saying so <e>", "<cs> i can assure the noble lord that there is no difference between us on the importance of training <e> <s> the government believe that this is important for all employees though clearly there is an additional spur where the safety of the public is closely connected with the activities of the employees <e>", "<cs> i cannot give the assurance that the noble lord seeks that the wording of the act is exactly the same as that in the amendment <e> <s> however if he were to look at section of the act i think he would find that in principle the matters covered are the same <e>", "<cs> at the risk of taking a little of the committees time it states <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to the points raised by the noble lord <e> <s> i have to tell him that british gas has a most excellent record at the moment in buying british goods <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me to continue my theme one example of this is their development of the rough field <e> <s> the investment in rough totals some million <e> <s> of that about per cent <e> <s> has been spent with uk companies <e> <s> this is a massive project and a massive amount of money and a huge benefit and compliment to british industry who won the contracts in the face of stiff worldwide competition <e> <s> so there was no case of protectionism when those contracts were awarded <e> <s> this track record is proof that british industry can compete effectively with the rest of the world <e>", "<cs> i followed the argument of the noble lord lord williams of elvel

lord bruce of donington particularly focused upon <e> <s> the noble lord indeed quoted the article as follows <e>", "<cs> i do not have an answer to that but i do not think that that is really the point <e> <s> at the moment british gas has a record of about per cent <e> <s> being supplied by british suppliers and most of that is won in competition and not just because they are british suppliers <e> <s> i would go further than that <e> <s> to answer the point made by my noble friend lord sanderson who spoke about british gas and offshore procurement i would point out that british gas is a party to the memorandum of understanding and the code of practice between the uk offshore operators association and the government under which companies operating on the united kingdom continental shelf agree to give british suppliers of goods and services a full and fair opportunity to compete for orders <e> <s> there is therefore no need for any new provision on offshore procurement in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords in the first quarter of this year the current account showed a surplus of nearly billion <e> <s> the figures for march which showed a current account

manufacturing industry exports of manufactured goods last year were at a record level in terms of both volume and value <e> <s> of course imports have grown more than exports <e> <s> half of the deterioration in the balance of manufactures in the first quarter reflects trade in erratic items such as aircraft and precious stones <e> <s> they should not be taken as entirely indicative of the trend <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has obviously done his homework on the figures <e> <s> i have done my homework on the figures as well <e> <s> i cannot argue with them <e> <s> the figures are in the printed paper office of your lordships house for all your lordships to see <e> <s> as i said in my original answer the first quarter figures for this year should not be taken as indicative of the overall position <e> <s> we are still predicting a current account surplus of billion to billion for the year as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree that the contribution from the tourist sector will fall this year <e> <s> i do not have the actual figures with me <e> <s> i understand however that we are predicting a further small increase in tourism this coming year <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to tell the noble lord that the trend in the balance of payments in manufactured goods has been getting worse for the last to years <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend makes a valid point <e> <s> i do not wish however to become involved in an economic debate this afternoon <e> <s> i have given an answer to the question on the order paper which relates to the current account balance of payments <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i agree that we should like to see a positive trade in current account in visibles <e> <s> it is inevitable that part of the revenues from oil the surplus on services and money from increased manufactured exports will be spent on imports <e> <s> some of these imports are in intermediate goods to fuel growth on capital goods to invest for the future and on consumer goods to increase freedom of choice <e> <s> this is what trade is about <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is of course quite right <e> <s> that is certainly not going to happen under this government <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i have heard that speech before <e> <s> i repeat that last year exports of manufactured goods by both volume and value were at an all-time record <e> <s> we expect that to be improved upon this year <e>", "<cs> my lords the fall in the price of oil has advantages for the economy as well as disadvantages for the balance of trade obviously <e> <s> it makes our manufactured goods more competitive in a world market that should also benefit from the fall in the price of oil <e> <s> the march figures showed a surplus in oil of million <e> <s> we predict that that surplus will probably be maintained for this year <e>", "<cs> my lords the british national space centre was formed in november with mr roy gibson as its first director-general <e> <s> the bnscs main task has been to prepare a national space plan which takes into account the interests of the various users of space <e> <s> this will be considered by ministers in the summer together with proposals on the future status funding and staffing of the bnsc <e>", "<cs> my lords the british national space centres policy and programme centre is located in london <e> <s> it has about staff drawn from the department of trade and industry the ministry of defence and the other two bodies that i mentioned <e> <s> its technology arm is based on the rae at farnborough and the rutherford appleby laboratory at chilton <e> <s> it can draw on the equivalent of about full-time staff <e> <s> future staffing arrangements will be considered by ministers in the summer <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly i shall pay attention to that <e> <s> as i said in my original answer ministers are considering the plan and will report this summer <e> <s> the director-general is responsible to my right honourable friend the minister of state for information technology and he will therefore be responsible to parliament for that centres actions <e>", "<cs> my lords that is one of the matters that is being considered <e> <s> as i said in my original answer about the centres future funding at present the government are spending about million a year on space science and civil space research and development <e> <s> about three-quarters of that is through the european space agency <e>", "<cs> my lords practice in respect of unpaid bills is a matter for the commercial judgment of the industries themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that in general the public monopolies treat their customers with fairness <e> <s> i understand that there is normally a period of days between the receipt of the first bill <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a matter for the industries themselves <e> <s> i am sure that they will take note of what the noble lord has said <e> <s> however it must be for the industries themselves to decide how best to deal with the matter <e>", "<cs> i fully understand the concern of the noble lord lord diamond that information should be produced about the parts of the business rather than gas supply as a whole and specifically that a distinction be made between tariff customers and contract customers <e> <s> however any requirement to publish audited profit figures relating to sales of particular categories of gas must be compatible with the nature of the business <e>", "<cs> the noble lord says very little but it does nevertheless <e> <s> the noble lord paid tribute to the extent of the information published by british gas in its annual report and i join him in congratulating them on the standards of their financial reporting but i am sure he will agree that these accounts do not include the information that is called for under the amendment <e> <s> this of course as i have explained is because they could not be produced on a fully reliable basis <e>", "<cs> i should like to pick up two points that the noble lord makes <e> <s> he says that it may be possible to produce unaudited accounts or that sort of thing <e> <s> i hoped i had made it clear that the choice of bases would materially affect the accounts <e> <s> the figures could be quite a long way different it is not just a question of a halfpenny or a penny to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> i believe that it is better to leave things as they are with the power of the director to call for all the necessary information about the tariff market and handle things that way <e>", "<cs> let me ask the noble lord one question <e> <s> why should it be more important after the supply becomes a privatised monopoly as he describes it to know the difference between the tariff and the contract customer <e> <s> why then at the present <e>", "<cs> we have reached i believe a suitable moment to adjourn the committee stage <e> <s> in moving that the house do now resume i suggest that we do not return to the committee stage of the gas bill until pm <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> we have had an interesting debate on this amendment <e> <s> in my opinion the beginnning of the amendment seeks to place on the secretary of state the director and the public gas supplier an impossible task <e> <s> it is not possible for them to ensure the long-term future of gas supplies whatever amount of research and development is put into it <e>", "<cs> under public ownership and it will wish to continue to do it under private ownership because for its shareholders and customers it will wish to continue in business into the foreseeable future <e>", "<cs> i wondered whether the noble lord could explain to me how the constraints <e>", "<cs> i too hope that we can press on and make progress with the bill <e> <s> i hope i can also satisfy noble lords on the main points of this amendment <e> <s> subsections and of clause provide wide-ranging powers to include conditions in an authorisation <e> <s> subsection <e>", "<cs> i would gladly have given the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon an explanation of the meaning of subsection but i did not have an opportunity because he did not move the amendment <e> <s> therefore i could not <e> <s> but if the noble lord lord bruce of donington would like me to do so now my noble friend lord belstead will deal in a moment or two with the points made by the noble lord lord diamond <e> <s> i shall be as brief as i can <e>", "<cs> the amendment which the noble lord lord bruce of donington has moved concerns the considerations which the secretary of state and the director should have regard to in granting authorisations under clause to ordinary suppliers that is those suppliers who do not wish to become public gas suppliers with the special rights and duties which they would obtain in the context of clause <e>", "<cs> it does not have to do so <e> <s> clause covers the whole of those sections <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord stoddart seeks to introduce consultation arrangements particularly with the health and safety executive on clause authorisations <e> <s> we do not believe that statutory provision for an extended consultation process is either necessary or desirable since essentially an authorisation under clause would relate to a supply agreement between two parties and we wish to add to the prospects for competition and not reduce them <e> <s> i recognise the noble lords concern about safety which indeed we fully share on this side of the committee <e> <s> but the requirements of the gas and health and safety legislation automatically attach to such supplies and the establishments concerned will be subject to inspection by health and safety inspectors <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon reminded us we had a pretty full debate on amendment no <e> <s> c on the whole subject of research and development and i therefore do not propose to cover again the ground on which if i did not convince noble lords opposite with my reply i at least managed to convince a majority of the committee <e> <s> i shall therefore concentrate on the two aspects of this amendment which are different <e>", "<cs> i think we are all agreed that energy efficiency is a good thing and none more so than the present government who have an enormous programme going on this year and continuing that has been referred to already in this debate <e> <s> and it has been mentioned frequently at other times <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that i have not been able to satisfy the noble lord lord graham of edmonton <e> <s> i am not sure whether the noble lord was in his place for the long and interesting debate on amendment no <e> <s> in which my noble friend lord belstead agreed to bring something back before the next stage extending the provision of the authorisation to cover energy efficiency <e> <s> as i said just a few moments ago we would take into account what has been said today on that subject <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could point the noble lord lord dean of beswick to clause of the bill which is arguably the most important clause in the bill <e> <s> i refer to clause <e>", "<cs> this is certainly one of the matters we shall take into consideration when we draft this new clause in the authorisation <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me to intervene i was referring throughout to amendment no <e> <s> which we had discussed <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> lord stoddart of swindon for having moved the amendment <e> <s> in committee i have gained the impression that noble lords on the opposition benches think that the existing legislation is probably superior to the bill that we are introducing <e> <s> i must tell the noble lord that the words may be go back to the act <e> <s> in fact they go back to the gas works clauses act <e> <s> there is therefore some reluctance on my part that we should change something which goes back that far <e> <s> however in view of what the noble lord lord stoddart has said i am happy to accept the amendment if he wishes to press it now having heard my explanation of how far the words go back <e>", "<cs> i fully recognise the concern which the noble lord has expressed that the less well off in our society should not be able to take advantage of their entitlement to a supply of gas because they are unable to find the necessary security payment <e> <s> we understand the anxieties to which the need for security payments gives rise <e> <s> at the same time we have to recognise that the bill like current gas legislation places onerous supply obligations on public gas suppliers and there has to be a counterweight to those <e> <s> security payments are one <e>", "<cs> may i take up a couple of points one of which was made by my noble friend lady gardner of parkes in connection with what was said by the noble lord lord diamond <e> <s> my noble friend rightly said that much of the problem was caused by people moving from short let to short let and disappearing after say six months without paying their bills <e> <s> they are not necessarily the people to whom the noble lord lord graham referred who cannot afford to pay their bills <e> <s> quite frankly they are the people who do a bunk <e>", "<cs> we are at committee stage and the noble lord has ample opportunity to come back <e> <s> i should like to take up a point made by the noble lord lord graham of edmonton about the less well-off in society and not those who are deliberately trying to cheat the gas board out of the money due <e> <s> as the noble lord may be aware british gas offers a number of different arrangements for the less well-off as does the department of health and social security <e> <s> these are outlined in the code which has already been referred to this evening <e> <s> there is the system of fuel direct for those on supplementary benefit who find difficulty in balancing their books <e> <s> gas bills are paid direct to the gas board from social security benefits <e> <s> there is also the opportunity to have a meter installed <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> there is the opportunity to buy stamps which can be used against the bill or indeed to make a regular monthly payment against the bill <e> <s> so there are plenty of ways in which the people with whom the noble lord lord graham of edmonton is concerned can be helped <e>", "<cs> as i said when speaking on the last amendment the government recognise the advantages which attach to prepayment meters where there is fuel hardship <e>", "<cs> i understand that there may be a charge <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that a charge can be made but that one is not always made <e>", "<cs> the amendment that my noble friend has tabled draws our attention to the change in the arbitration arrangements introduced under the bill as a result of the new structure for <e>", "<cs> to answer the first question of the noble lord lord williams yes i think that that would be the procedure that would be adopted <e> <s> if the customer did not agree with the director he would have to go to the courts <e> <s> at present i cannot give an estimate of the number of cases which might come up before the director but i remind the noble lord that the director will not be entirely on his own he will have a reasonable staff <e> <s> i am not suggesting that any of these cases would necessarily have to go right up to the top <e>", "<cs> we have already had a number of interesting debates on the question of security deposits <e> <s> i accept that they are not a popular measure but i believe that there is reluctant acceptance that they represent an important counterweight to the supply and other obligations which will rest on public gas suppliers under the bill <e>", "<cs> i said that i would let the committee know the answer as to whether they were or not but i certainly take the point that the noble lord makes <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may first answer the question just posed by the noble lord lord diamond why is six months better than three <e> <s> as i said orginally this is what we consider to be a <e>", "<cs> i have looked at the relevant part of the authorisation and i see the specified rate to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> what i cannot put my finger on at the moment is how often that rate changes during the operation <e>", "<cs> i know the treasury bill rate is published weekly but that would be an extremely complicated form of calculating a deposit if you are working on a weekly changing rate <e> <s> i should have thought that in general terms one could probably set a rate for a reasonable length of time say three months or six months <e> <s> i think that to tie the director down to watching the weekly treasury bill tender every friday afternoon would be putting a rather onerous task upon the man because all these deposits are not necessarily running simultaneously over a six-month or three-month period <e> <s> i do not really think we can tie the director down to that kind of specification <e>", "<cs> i think that we have reached a suitable moment to adjourn the committee for dinner and in moving that the house do now resume i propose that we should not return to the committee stage on this bill until eight oclock <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> but now he does know <e>", "<cs> before i start may i ask the noble lord whether he was also speaking during that amendment to amendments nos <e> <s> dc and dd which were grouped with this amendment and i think probably should go with it <e> <s> in the grouping we had also agreed that amendments nos <e> <s> a b c and a would go together <e> <s> however i am happy to answer them one by one if the noble lord would prefer me to <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly try to clarify the situation in so far as we see it and i hope to the satisfaction of noble lords <e> <s> we appreciate the concern that the director should be given time to consider a report and the need for advice to be given to the secretary of state <e> <s> but as i say i hope to persuade the noble lord that the regime established in the bill already caters for these matters <e>", "<cs> what i said was that the director will have been responsible for initiating the report and will have given evidence to the mmc as to the need for the proposed modification <e> <s> he will therefore be familiar with the subject matter <e>", "<cs> on that basis i am most grateful to the noble lord lord diamond and i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state for trade and industry announced the start of the review yesterday <e> <s> the review will cover mergers and restrictive trade practices policy <e> <s> it will investigate both the scope for changes in policy under existing law and the desirability of changes in the law <e>", "<cs> my lords as to the timing of the review there is much ground to be covered and it is important that time should be allowed for a thorough job <e> <s> it is possible however that recommendations for change in policy under existing law may be identified at an early stage of the review <e> <s> if so the government will not hesitate to make any desirable changes immediately <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can give the assurance that the noble lord seeks that the review <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not accept that from the noble lord <e> <s> i do not accept that the current situation is entirely unsatisfactory <e> <s> the purpose of this review is to see where there are areas which cause concern and whether those areas can be identified <e> <s> if it is found that there is something wrong something will be done about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly take note of the views of my noble friend lord orr-ewing and i shall indeed pass them on to my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords the terms of reference of the review are as set out in the written answer given in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e> <s> as to the specific case that the noble lord mentions i cannot give an undertaking that that will be covered but i am sure that it will <e> <s> i am not too sure that i follow his accusations regarding ministers of the crown <e>", "<cs> my lords again i can do no more than take note of the views of the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe and i shall pass them on to my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i do not necessarily accept that large-scale sackings take place as a result of mergers <e> <s> in fact in many cases mergers lead to a more effective industry in the industry concerned and improve employment prospects <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i am sure that this will be one of the things which the review will look at as it is one of the aspects which has attracted criticism recently <e> <s> as i said at the beginning the review should be wide open to public debate and views will be taken note of <e>", "<cs> my lords as to the first part of my noble friends supplementary question at the moment i do not have the information with me but we are planning to get the best possible advice and expert knowledge available whether from inside or outside government <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i shall endeavour to do so and i shall write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords as i think i said in answer to the last supplementary question we hope to get expert advice from both inside and outside <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that we are due to return to the dockyard services bill in one minute and as i think that all noble lords who wish to take part in the committee stage are present at the moment i see no reason to adjourn the house <e>", "<cs> my lords in moving that further consideration on report of this bill be now adjourned i suggest that we do not return to this bill before half-past eight <e> <s> i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for moving this amendment <e> <s> it was probably myself who answered her most recent question on the matter relating to the resale of electricity rather than gas <e> <s> as the noble baroness reminded us this question has been looked at from time to time in respect not only of gas but also of electricity <e> <s> most recently there was the report of the director general of fair trading last year <e>", "<cs> we have had an interesting debate on what is i think a very important matter <e> <s> i am grateful to all noble lords on all sides who have expressed their concern about it <e> <s> as we have already explained during our debates on clause amendments matters concerning gas safety are the responsibility of the health and safety commission <e> <s> they through the health and safety executive administer the gas safety legislation which will following the passage of this bill become relevant statutory provisions for the purposes of the health and safety at work act <e>", "<cs> the regulation reads as follows <e>", "<cs> we have had an interesting discussion on this amendment and i must say straight away to noble lords opposite that the only matter about which i can probably agree with them is that the government are indeed concerned to get a good price for the sale of the british gas corporation <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord diamond has seen the report published recently by the stockbrokers wood mackenzie which throws some light on this aspect the effect of lower oil prices on british gas <e>", "<cs> i am quite happy to rephrase my original remark <e> <s> the government are concerned to get the best price <e> <s> having said that it is nearly impossible to get absolutely the best price as the noble lord will be aware <e>", "<cs> i said <e>", "<cs> i think that that is what i said <e>", "<cs> i do not really believe that the market works like that <e> <s> who is to judge when the best market conditions will take place <e> <s> we might have just missed them for all i know <e> <s> i do not feel <e>", "<cs> i am not going to take my noble friends advice at this point but i shall fairly speedily sit down <e> <s> the government will seek a fair price in the light of all the circumstances and these will include market conditions <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has answered his own question when he said the house that he used as an example had a market value of <e> <s> that is the price at which we would attempt to sell the house <e> <s> the noble lord should not confuse the asset value which we will come to in a later amendment with the market value of the company <e>", "<cs> we recognise the widespread desire to give the director the fullest <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord says we really come to that on the next amendment <e> <s> however i am quite happy to speak on that amendment now and to give the explanation that the noble lord lord williams seeks <e> <s> the successor company to be nominated by the secretary of state will be a registered company with no assets and liabilities and with an authorised share capital of with a paid-up share capital of two shares owned by the secretary of state or his nominee <e> <s> in other wordsit will in all respects be a shell company which will not have traded until vesting day <e> <s> this shell company has already been formed in preparation for vesting but will be entirely dormant until then <e> <s> it is not proposed <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for this opportunity to address the question of the articles of association since these are of course fundamental to the activities of the new company <e> <s> let me say straight away that i understand the desire of noble lords to ensure that the draft articles of british gas which have been public for some months and which were made available to noble lords at the beginning of the committee stage should be established as the articles of the successor company <e> <s> however i hope to demonstrate to noble lords why a statutory arrangement would be inappropriate <e>", "<cs> no not really <e> <s> i cannot give a reason why the company might wish to change its articles of association <e> <s> i am sure that there could be various different reasons <e> <s> i said that with regard to the government their interest in the articles of association was restricted to the limitation of holdings in which the special share is important <e> <s> that is a matter which cannot be changed whereas they might want to change something relatively minor <e>", "<cs> i think we have reached a suitable stage to resume the house <e> <s> in doing so i would <e>", "<cs> i am aware of the concern expressed by the noble viscount lord chandos that an issue of the size of british gas might impact adversely on the normal fund-raising activities of other quoted companies <e> <s> i have to say that i do not believe his fears are justified <e> <s> the government plan their privatisation programme well in advance and those plans are known and understood by those involved in both the uk and overseas markets <e>", "<cs> yes i quite accept that it is different <e> <s> but i do not think anybody would suggest that the whole billion to billion should be raised at one go <e> <s> i think that is taken for granted <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord wishes to intervene perhaps he would do so from other than a <e>", "<cs> i am tempted to take these amendments briefly <e> <s> the purpose of the first the six-month limit and there is no dispute on this is merely a requirement to set the target investment limit immediately and it would remove the secretary of states flexibility and could give rise to practical difficulties in relation to the need for example to retain a short-term float of shares which could be allotted to deserving cases such as lost application forms during an interim period following the allocation <e> <s> those would revert to the secretary of state if the float were not exhausted <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly look at the first point that the noble lord makes and write to him <e> <s> if there is any way in which the bill can be improved by taking account of the suggestions that the noble lord has made we shall be delighted to do so <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord diamond explained the amendment seeks to give the secretary of state control over the maximum rate of dividend payable on ordinary shares by the successor company <e> <s> the whole purpose of privatisation is to free british gas from interference by government in its affairs to which it is subject at present and to provide for real public ownership so that consumers and others can take a personal stake in the industry whose services they use <e>", "<cs> my lords the taxation of benefits arising from car-parking facilities is not a new feature of the tax system <e> <s> the government propose no changes in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords no meaner than the government in either or because those were the two years in which these particular provisions came into effect <e> <s> the noble lord asked particularly about vouchers <e> <s> the scheme in that respect was introduced in <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first answer the point raised by the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> it would be taxed as a benefit in kind and added in with all the other benefits in kind <e> <s> however as i have said in most cases it is extremely unlikely that the annual value is sufficient for the tax to be worth collecting <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that there is anything i can say to that <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of it <e> <s> i am most interested in what the noble lord lord williams of elvel has said but i think it goes slightly wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government have no such intention <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord presumably refers to the united states where they are proposing to do this <e> <s> i must say that we are looking into the question to see whether it is an infringement of the gatt agreement and so is the ec which has some reservations about these proposed charges <e> <s> this government have no plans to introduce such charges <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords it is fair to say that the bill has in general terms received a welcome from all sides of your lordships house <e> <s> i referred in introducing the debate to the great care that the government have taken to consult as widely as possible about it and i am grateful to many noble lords who have paid tribute to that <e> <s> throughout the government have sought to produce a bill which sets the best possible framework for the future development of the societies and i believe it is a generally non-partisan measure <e> <s> i am heartened that so many noble lords share that view <e>", "<cs> my lords i stand corrected by my noble friend i am sure he was part of that pressure <e> <s> i come closer to home to say that when we consider the bill in committee we will demand as the noble lord lord houghton will know a minimum of peers present if matters come to a vote <e> <s> if the number present falls below that then the proceedings are suspended <e> <s> that is quite a good example to give the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords in the area of health care exemption from vat has applied since the introduction of the tax to supplies by persons who are registered or enrolled on any of the statutory medical registers <e> <s> this provides a clear borderline which is understood by all concerned and generally accepted as reasonable <e>", "<cs> my lords it is open to any of these people to apply to the council for professions supplementary to medicine for exemption under the professions supplementary to medicine act <e> <s> if they were listed or registered by the council they would be exempt from vat <e> <s> i suggest that it is certainly not a matter which should be decided by the vat inspector <e> <s> the best route is for them to apply to be registered and if they were successful they would be exempt <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have just said the machinery exists <e> <s> under the professions supplementary to medicine act it is open to any of these bodies to apply to the council for professions supplementary to medicine and if they can get on the register through that route their services will be exempt from vat <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly draw these exchanges to the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services but at the end of the day my right honourable friend is responsible for decisions or if there is a dispute for the decision of the council for professions supplementary to medicine <e> <s> therefore i would suggest that it is easier for any groups such as osteopaths to apply first to the council and pending the result if necessary to go to the secretary of state <e> <s> i certainly do not think that it would be right for the vat inspector to be the person to take this decision <e>", "<cs> my lords far be it from me to discuss the merits or demerits of any particular group of medical practitioners <e> <s> all i can say is that all the main medical practitioners are exempt from vat at the moment doctors dentists opticians nurses midwives and in addition those who qualify under the professions supplementary to medicine act that is to say chiropodists dieticians etc <e> <s> if osteopaths wish to join in that group it is for them to apply and if they get on the register they will not have to pay vat <e>", "<cs> my lords i really have nothing further to add than that the chiropractors should apply to the council for professions supplementary to medicine in order to get on its register and therefore be exempt <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government have recently received the report of the severn tidal power group which has been engaged for the last two to three years in a study partly funded by government to assess the viability of a private sector barrage across the severn estuary <e> <s> the report is comprehensive and detailed <e> <s> consultations are taking place with the severn tidal group and other interested parties before a response can be made <e>", "<cs> my lords yes indeed <e> <s> this is potentially the second largest tidal barrage in the world and is certainly larger than that in france <e> <s> there is one in nova scotia which is presently the largest but this would be the second largest in the world <e>", "<cs> my lords this would be the near-weston-super-mare to near-cardiff barrage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that my answer is still shortly but i hope that the period will be shorter than the one mentioned the last time such a question was asked <e> <s> i shall indeed ensure that a copy of the report is placed in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords in fact i do not think that the noble lord will have long to wait <e> <s> following the publication of the bondi report the government promoted the severn tidal power groups report which was half-funded by the government <e> <s> originally the group was expected to report within two years <e> <s> in fact the report was published in may so it has taken slightly over three years <e> <s> however one must remember that it is an extremely large project and as the noble lord lord cledwyn said very substantial job opportunities are linked to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend is right but i am afraid that my memory does not take me back quite that far <e>", "<cs> my lords the report produced by the severn tidal power group will concentrate on the energy-producing aspects <e> <s> however in their response the government will have to take into account not only that but the environ-mental impact on the area plus of course the possibility of a road crossing which is what i think the noble lord lord underhill was referring to and also of course the possible effects upon recreation and tourism <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that that is one of the matters which will be taken into consideration <e>", "<cs> in moving that the house do now resume i suggest that we do not return to consideration in committee on this bill until twenty minutes to nine oclock <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until minutes to nine oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords the ordering of new power stations in england and wales is a matter for the central electricity generating board in scotland for the scottish electricity boards and in northern ireland for the northern electricity service <e> <s> the boards will require the consent of my right honourable friends the secretaries of state for energy for scotland or for northern ireland as appropriate should they wish to proceed with such a station <e> <s> there is no application for a coal-fired power station currently under consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords the cegb is considering the possibility of building new coal-fired power stations <e> <s> it has included provision for a new coal-fired power station of an improved design in its capital investment memorandum and work on a reference design for such a station on which the cegb is co-operating with the manufacturers is proceeding and is expected to be completed by the end of <e> <s> the board is not seeking specific investment approval for the station at present <e> <s> i do not think that it would be right for my right honourable friend the secretary of state to intervene at this stage <e> <s> perhaps he should wait to see whether the cegb seeks approval <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> drax is a very good example <e> <s> like the noble lord lord dean of beswick i too think that there is need for new power stations but much of this hinges on the results of the sizewell inquiry which we expect in the autumn <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that even with the reduction negotiated between british coal and the cegb for the price of new coal it even approaches the price of nuclear power <e> <s> we also believe that nuclear power has a major role to play in meeting the countrys energy needs <e> <s> it has the potential to provide our cheapest power provided that new stations can be built to time and cost and it also provides an important component of diversity <e> <s> we still depend upon fossil fuels for the vast proportion of our energy supplies but your lordships will not need reminding how disruptive such dependence can be to the economy <e> <s> we therefore feel that to throw away the opportunity of an alternative source of energy would be foolish <e>", "<cs> my lords the government currently have an enormous programme of conservation of energy <e> <s> the potential is very large indeed <e> <s> nevertheless new power stations will still be needed before the end of the century <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly pass on the remarks of the noble lord lord dean of beswick to my right honourable friend <e> <s> that is really the best i can do at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we have reached a suitable moment to adjourn consideration of the bill on report <e> <s> in doing so i suggest that we do not return to this bill until half-past eight <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a convenient moment for me to beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> to begin with perhaps i should explain that as currently foreseen it should not be necessary to increase the number of members beyond the statutory limit set out in subsection which specifies members <e> <s> in order to cater for the unexpected it was considered appropriate to provide the treasury with the ability to increase the membership by means of statutory instrument <e> <s> however in the light of the points made by the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby with which i have a great deal of sympathy particularly concerning the growth of quangos i am able to say that the government will accept his amendment in principle <e>", "<cs> i hope we shall make rapid progress but i cannot give a guarantee that we shall proceed along these lines all the way through the bill <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord williams has rightly drawn attention to the need for the new building societies commission and the bank of england to co-operate closely over the general principles of the prudential supervision of deposit-taking institutions and in the day-to-day course of business <e> <s> their paths will cross at working level on many occasions and it is obviously right for there to be some formal link at the top <e> <s> as the noble lord pointed out this has already been recognised by the appointment of mr procter and i am glad that the noble lord has welcomed that appointment <e> <s> it would certainly be the governments intention that when mr procter retires there should be a further appointment of somebody with experience of banking and banking supervision <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i cannot give that specific assurance this afternoon <e> <s> i said that i would draw what has been said to the attention of treasury ministers <e> <s> i certainly undertake to do that <e> <s> however that is as far as i can go at the moment <e>", "<cs> with respect the noble lord does i think wish to move amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may start by explaining to the committee what is the main purpose of the commission <e> <s> the commission is essentially in the business of prudential supervision <e> <s> those who are putting their money into a building society need to be assured that the institutions in questions are solvent if their money is to be safeguarded and the integrity of the financial system is to be maintained <e> <s> the supervisory function which parliament has laid on the bank of england in the case of banks and which it will shortly give to the building societies commission under this bill is directed to that end <e> <s> therefore the commission does not relate to borrowers <e> <s> they are not at risk in the same way if an institution becomes insolvent <e> <s> the protection of the borrower is hence not a matter for the commission <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord lord denning and my noble friend lord selkirk have reminded us that one of the principal distinguishing features of building societies has always been that they rely upon their members to raise funds <e> <s> the mutual principle of building societies has always been the raising of money from members for lending to members <e> <s> these amendments would remove that in one fell swoop <e> <s> while this legislation seeks to equip building societies to compete effectively in the commercial environment of the late s the s and beyond it has never been the intention to dismantle the fundamental bases of their operations <e> <s> thus the government seek to provide that notwith-standing the new powers the bulk of building society business will continue to be residential mortgages <e> <s> the bill preserves the mutual status of the societies and introduces a series of constitutional changes designed to make mutuality work better <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble and learned lord lord denning has probably answered the first question that the noble lord lord houghton asked <e> <s> i gather that it is a standard provision in legislation of this sort and has been given to all statutory bodies of this kind since the th century <e> <s> i assure the noble lord that there is nothing sinister in it <e>", "<cs> we have had an interesting debate on this subject which was debated at length in another place during the committee stage <e> <s> may i first say that my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor would have very much liked to reply to this debate but owning to state duties in connection with the visit of the president of the federal republic of germany he may not be able to stay until the end of it <e>", "<cs> it is indeed the intention that the commissioners will have fixed-term appointments and the period is likely to be in the range of three to five years <e> <s> we would not therefore want to go as far as does the amendment of the noble lord in putting in the statute exactly how long they should remain <e> <s> we should like to retain flexibility so that the commission can retain expertise <e> <s> it is possible to envisage circumstances in which a commissioner has been appointed originally for a fixed term and has had his appointment extended for a further period <e> <s> then because of the ill-health of another commissioner it might be desirable to reappoint him for a further short period <e> <s> we should like to retain the flexibility as it is <e> <s> but i can give the information which the noble lord lord houghton seeks that the period is likely to be within the range of three to five years <e> <s> i hope that will satisfy him <e>", "<cs> each individual appointment will be separately negotiated so to speak for a term of between three and five years <e> <s> if i have any further information to give the noble lord i shall write to him on that point <e>", "<cs> yes i shall indeed do so if i cannot give an answer now <e> <s> it will be a fixed period of between three and five years <e> <s> perhaps i may write to the noble lord lord harris of greenwich and let him have a copy of the letter <e> <s> if i have been in any way unclear in my answer i shall certainly deal with the matter <e>", "<cs> i know that i am on touchy ground here <e> <s> i think that the best i can do is to put the blame on the party opposite because the bill as originally drafted did not contain this provision <e> <s> indeed it was only put into the bill in response to an undertaking given in committee to the honourable member for ipswich who is a member of the party opposite <e> <s> i am not allowed to quote verbatim what the honourable member said but he implied that labour members believe that an age limit must be part of the qualification for being a commissioner <e> <s> he said that no one had said that beyond some arbitrary age someone has outlived his or her usefulness <e> <s> he said that it is frequently the case that wisdom and experience go with age and that in public life people of very senior ages make major contributions to public decisions <e> <s> that certainly is the case in this chamber <e> <s> he went on to say that he felt however that when one has reached the age of it is time to let a younger person have a go and i would endorse that particular aspect of what he said <e> <s> to be fair to those of us below the age of it is perhaps a good idea occasionally to let somebody below that age have a go at these things <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the opportunity given to me by the noble lord lord houghton to offer an explanation <e> <s> it is unusual to give a legislative power to an authority other than a minister who as a member of parliament is directly answerable to parliament <e> <s> on constitutional grounds it can be argued that it is inappropariate to allow for the power to be exercised other than by the commission <e> <s> from a policy viewpoint it is desirable for the commission itself which is a supervisory body being established under this legislation to take decisions regarding any power it has to make orders etc <e> <s> by statutory instrument rather than allow for delegation <e> <s> the expertise will be in the collectivity of the commission and that is where the final authority should rest <e>", "<cs> yes i thought that i had answered that point <e> <s> the commission may make and lay statutory instruments under the provisions of the statutory instruments act which is equivalent to the provision currently in force in respect of the chief registrar under the act <e>", "<cs> it is a negative instrument <e> <s> it would be laid by a treasury minister i gather but it would be laid on behalf of the commission <e>", "<cs> yes i hope that i have made that clear <e>", "<cs> i certainly accept the points made by the noble lord lord barnett <e> <s> i must immediately say that a great many of these amendments are purely drafting amendments <e> <s> as the committee are aware it is a very large bill and there are many technical matters arising from it <e> <s> many other amendments are a result of the continuing process of consultation with interested parties and others arising from commitments made by the government in another place <e> <s> there are also a considerable number of amendments resulting from the consolidation of the northern ireland companies legislation and of the insolvency legislation which is presently going through parliament <e> <s> i believe that about or amendments relate to the insolvency bill <e> <s> there are one or two amendments of substance and when we reach those we shall debate them fully <e>", "<cs> my noble friend and i will do our best to give a comprehensive explanation of the amendments as they are dealt with <e> <s> i hope that we shall be able to give them the consideration they deserve <e> <s> i certainly take the point made by the noble lord lord barnett about the possibility of notes being available before the next stage and i shall see what i can do <e> <s> in the meantime i certainly undertake that during the passage of this committee stage we shall not try to slip anything through on the nod so to speak which could be of substance <e>", "<cs> it is solely maladministration by the building societies commission that he can look into <e>", "<cs> of course it is entirely proper and necessary that decisions not to renew an authorisation under clause or to revoke authorisation under clause should be publicised when brought into effect that is after conclusion of any appeal proceedings <e> <s> in fact the bill makes provision for placing a record of these events on the public file and no doubt the commission would include information about such cases in the annual reports and make such other provision as it considers appropriate <e> <s> there is no need for express statutory reference to this because it is covered by the words in clause <e>", "<cs> i can expand my reply on clauses and by saying that instead of saying no doubt would i shall say will because i went on to say slightly further on that it was covered in clause on the report of the discharge of its functions <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> that is the sort of point that i am making to give everyone a chance to put themselves right without the kind of results that publicity could achieve at that particular moment <e>", "<cs> in one word yes the provision covers the situation of borrowing members <e> <s> i gather that some societies insist that borrowers should be depositors as well <e> <s> that is easily overcome by merely putting a pound or something like that into the society <e> <s> other societies do not insist that borrowers should have any share in the society <e> <s> this covers borrowers <e>", "<cs> basically this is the number of members who upon joining together have an absolute right to force a question to be put to a vote at an annual general meeting <e> <s> this in fact comes straight from the act <e> <s> there is no change <e>", "<cs> i accept that the subject of conversion to public company status is an extremely important part of the bill <e> <s> we shall be returning to that no doubt in due course when we reach the main clause which it involves which the noble lord lord barnett has given notice to oppose <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for raising this matter <e> <s> it is one that has caused concern over the country as a whole and possibly in certain high streets that every second shop seems to be a building society <e> <s> but i think that my noble friend lord campbell of croy has to some extent answered that question <e> <s> i can confirm that the huge growth of the s in the number of branches has now slowed down <e> <s> perhaps it will not go any further now that there is greater competition in the market and costs will have to be contained <e> <s> however i cannot accept this amendment which would require the commission to vet every application by a building society to open a branch <e> <s> i think that that would be a very onerous task on the commission <e> <s> i am sure that we want to see the commission not over-staffed but adequately staffed for <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord decides what to do with the amendment perhaps i may retract a little of what i said <e> <s> i withdraw the offer to bring the matter to the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord woud like to refer particular cases to his own local authority where he feels that that is applicable <e>", "<cs> i shall deal briefly with the first two amendments amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i can give the noble lord an assurance that amendment no <e> <s> is not necessary and that debt instruments would be covered by borrowing money in clause <e>", "<cs> i am pleased to know about that flexibility and i hope that his honourable friends down the other end accept that same view <e>", "<cs> i can do little better than read out what it says in the notes on clauses which i think makes the situation fairly clear <e>", "<cs> the reason for the limit of per cent <e> <s> of total assets is to ensure that societies apply the bulk of their funds for the purposes of the legislation that is to the building societies not banks <e>", "<cs> i mentioned in my earlier remarks that subsection allows the commission at any time by notice to a building society to direct that the limit in force under the section shall not subject to any conditions specified in the notice apply to the society during such period as the commission specifies <e> <s> that may be part of the answer the noble lord looks for <e> <s> i doubt if it is the whole answer <e> <s> the commission does have some discretion as i have said <e> <s> perhaps i may write to the noble lord throwing further light on this <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for raising the point <e> <s> it is not one which i had considered before <e> <s> if i may i shall look into what the noble lord has said and write to him before the next stage <e>", "<cs> yes i agree with everything that the noble lord lord williams has said <e> <s> we believe however that this is covered by use of the words <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord had allowed me to finish the paragraph perhaps i could have provided a little more clarification <e> <s> we believe that these words cover the point he raises <e> <s> the commission may specify the conditions under which such contracts may be used and these could include any further restrictions that may be appropriate <e> <s> therefore i think that the commission will be keeping a very close eye on the way in which these operations are conducted <e> <s> i have a difficulty with the noble lords amendment in that it might be difficult to operate in practice since it requires the use of contracts which are of a non-speculative nature <e> <s> that may in practice prove difficult since any investment of its very nature carries some degree of risk however slight so that it could rule out virtually all the types of contract that we have in mind in this clause <e>", "<cs> at the moment i do not think i can go much further than what i in fact said that the commission may specify the conditions under which such contracts may be used and these could <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord strabolgi pointed out the limit of provides consistency with the comparable scheme for banks and licensed deposit takers under the banking act <e> <s> it also ensures that statutory investor protection is not set at an unduly generous level which removes an important discipline from investors and building society managements <e>", "<cs> as regards the noble lords second point i am able to say that if the banking act figure were changed we would bring forward the necessary statutory instrument under that act to put up the figure <e>", "<cs> i have not read that particu-lar part of the building societies brief so we shall see whether it does <e> <s> briefly i can say that this merely provides the power to bring new provisions forward for the services which societies may wish to carry out <e> <s> i could give one example the provision of personal pensions within the meaning of the social security bill <e> <s> that could be one service which the building societies might wish to be allowed to take part in in the future <e> <s> a second example might be investment business <e> <s> i can say here that we intend to bring forward an amendment at the next stage of the bill to provide for building societies to be able to do personal equity plans <e> <s> those are two examples of the sort of functions which we might wish to have included <e>", "<cs> as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> yes i can give that assurance <e>", "<cs> i understand my noble friends concern about small professional practices but as i said during the second reading debate i am sure that many will adapt to the new competition and thrive on it <e> <s> we should not assume too readily that building societies will try to use their new powers in a monopolistic fashion such as my noble friend seems to suggest <e> <s> after all first they will not have the market share and strength in these new services to do so <e> <s> secondly in general they will need to look to the new services as a means of generating profit in order to stay competitive in the mortgage and savings markets <e> <s> there is a great threat of competition in that market at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords the increase in electricity prices which took effect from st april has been offset to a great extent by the reductions announced on th june following the conclusion of the agreement on coal prices between the central electricity generating board and british coal <e> <s> that agreement takes account of the recent fall in the price of oil <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the first point of the noble lord lord ezra it was unfortunate perhaps that the deal between british coal and the central electricity generating board was not concluded before the st april when the price increases were announced <e> <s> in regard to the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i take note of my noble friends views on that point and i shall no doubt come back to this at another stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the link with france which i do not think is yet complete will result in the central electricity generating board being able to purchase electricity per cent <e> <s> cheaper than it could be generated on average in the united kingdom and of course this will benefit the united kingdom consumers <e> <s> however i do not think that the link is yet complete <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept that at all <e> <s> the deal was done between british coal and the electricity board <e> <s> it was the best deal that could be done between them bearing in mind the circumstances and it was a deal which was endorsed by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is right the electricity board suffered considerably from the miners strike and its costs were increased enormously <e> <s> however since the end of the strike british coal has been doing extremely well <e> <s> productivity is at record levels <e> <s> we hope that that will continue and that the benefits will be passed on to consumers <e>", "<cs> my lords that is quite true <e> <s> coal counts for nearly per cent <e> <s> of the production of electricity and at the moment it is an important factor in the equation <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept that <e> <s> electricity prices must be a matter of negotiation for the electricity board <e> <s> it has done the best deal that it can with british coal <e> <s> with regard to increases of electricity prices over the years i invite any noble lord to compare what has happened to electricity prices during the past few years with what happened in the period of the last labour government <e>", "<cs> my lords that is another question <e> <s> but the contracts of british gas do not necessarily all fall in at once as regards those tied to the oil price <e> <s> i am sure that over a period of time as contracts come up for renewal we shall see falls in price <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said just now certain gas purchase prices are linked to the price of oil but that is a difficult question to answer because there are a lot of different types of contract involved <e>", "<cs> my lords just to get the facts on the record for most domestic customers there will be a net increase in - of about per cent <e> <s> which is well below the rate of inflation <e> <s> those on economy tariffs will enjoy a net reduction <e> <s> for industry and commerce there is likely to be an even greater reduction <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that effectively i have explained the answers to every question that the noble lord has asked <e> <s> the coal burn of the electricity board is still around per cent <e> <s> whether the price of oil has come down or not the cegb still has to buy coal from british coal and it has negotiated the best deal that it could <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not entirely informed on the answer to that question <e> <s> all i can say is that the oil burn involved is only about per cent <e> <s> so it is not a particularly high proportion of the overall generation of electricity <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter between the noble lord and my noble friend <e> <s> i shall not comment on it <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment seeks to introduce as has been explained and debated the national interest as a criterion in the secretary of states decision as to the appointed day under clause and to give parliament a role in the timing of the order <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment which seeks to make the appointed day subject to parliamentary procedure is similar to the one we have just discussed <e> <s> it is certainly similar to ones we discussed at committee stage and i have no doubt were discussed at length in another place as well <e> <s> the only remaining questions that could be relevant to a debate would be the date specified on the order <e> <s> a fuller debate would be totally inappropriate when the provisions have just been subject to the fullest scrutiny and debate in both houses of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord diamond has said this amendment was tabled at committee stage on a day when the noble lord was i believe absent and when the amendment was moved by his noble friend lord hanworth <e> <s> i am surprised in a way to see the amendment tabled again because following the previous debate the noble viscount commented in respect of the response of my noble friend lord gray that <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord ezra reminded us we discussed this at an earlier stage <e> <s> the noble lords will perhaps not be surprised if i am not too friendly to them again this afternoon <e> <s> i should like to comment first on the proposal to delete the qualifying words <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should perhaps respond to one or two of the points raised <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce of donington said that the minister in parliament no longer had any responsibility in this field <e> <s> however clause lays out the duties of the secretary of state and the director and therefore if any of these matters were found to be unsatisfactory the minister would be responsible and have to answer to parliament for them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness said that to use the word economical might restrict the powers of a gas company to connect a new supply <e> <s> i can assure the noble baroness that that would not be the case <e> <s> this duty is on the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can attempt to explain why the bill is drafted as it is <e> <s> there are two main duties in clause of the bill <e> <s> the first one as we have discussed is to secure that all reasonable demands for gas are met <e> <s> that is in paragraph <e>", "<cs> we have had an interesting debate on this issue and this is the third time round in fact so far as concerns this amendment because by accident we discussed it twice at committee stage <e> <s> on this occasion i shall obviously concentrate on aspects of article of the treaty of rome <e> <s> we have been over the ground that british gas has a very good purchasing record in britain at the moment and i see no reason why that should not continue <e> <s> i remind noble lords that so far as offshore is concerned it is very carefully monitored by the offshore supplies office <e> <s> this has resulted in a very large amount of business coming into this country if i recall it is per cent <e>", "<cs> i gather not my lords no it is not <e> <s> so far as i understand it the agreement known as the luxembourg compromise which was mentioned by the noble lord lord bruce relates to voting in the council when member states believe that a vital national interest is concerned <e> <s> the application of article of the treaty of rome to this bill concerns the interpretation of a treaty obligation which the british government have entered into and which has been properly ratified by parliament <e> <s> as my noble friend lord campbell of alloway explained very clearly the application of article in a given case is a matter for the european court of justice and not a matter for the council of ministers <e> <s> as he explained it would not necessarily be from the actual amendment as proposed it would be from any possible implementation of the amendment that trouble could arise <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we have reached a suitable moment to adjourn for dinner and i suggest that we do not return to consideration on report of the gas bill until ten minutes past eight <e> <s> i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords i should just like to remind the noble lord that we are at the report stage of the bill and that noble lords are allowed to speak only once <e> <s> the noble lord is making a second speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i can deal with this point briefly <e> <s> this clause carries forward the provisions of section a of the gas act as introduced by section of the oil and gas enterprise act <e> <s> the whole point about clause is that it deals purely with contracts between the gas supplier and very large customers who are taking more than two million therms a year <e> <s> we believe that those <e>", "<cs> my lords on the noble lords first point on amendment no <e> <s> concerning present and future i can give him the assurance that he seeks <e> <s> the interpretation of the words in the bill as presently drafted already covers both the present and the future supply of gas <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may say that i do not see why british gas when they go into the private sector would wish to spend any less on research and development than they currently spend in the public sector <e> <s> they are in competition after all to a large extent with other fuels <e> <s> the oil companies all spend a great deal of money on research and development <e> <s> if they are going to remain competitive with other fuels particularly in the industrial market then they are going to want to continue their large programme of research and development <e> <s> i really think that there is no need to put this sort of thing into statute <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord diamond has sought in this amendment to clarify the first paragraph of the subsection permitting authorisation conditions relating to the supply of gas by adding specific references to the prices charged and other items of supply <e> <s> however i am afraid that in his search for clarity the noble lord has brought about the incidental effect of limiting the <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly look at the last point that the noble lord lord stoddart has raised regarding whether schedule should refer to condition or condition <e> <s> in turn perhaps i may draw the noble lords attention to schedule paragraph and schedule paragraph where he will see that the cost of ofgas and the gas consumers council is met out of money provided by parliament <e> <s> that means that the amount to be paid to ofgas and the gas consumers council will appear in the estimates and it will therefore be open to parliament to raise any matter of concern on the level of fees which i believe is the appropriate way forward <e> <s> i quite accept that in practice the moneys will be provided by the fees raised from the supplier but it will through that route be subject to parliamentary attention in any case <e>", "<cs> since the noble lord made his last remarks i have been to the printed paper office and picked up a copy of the proposed authorisation <e> <s> i have it with me <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes to go to the office and collect a copy he is welcome to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a subject on which we have touched on earlier occasions <e> <s> at the committee stage noble lords opposite originally tabled an amendment calling for one-twelfth of the deposit and in another place they were asking for one-twenty-fourth <e> <s> we understand the anxieties to which the need for security payments gives rise <e> <s> at the same time we have to recognise that the bill like current gas legislation places onerous supply obligations on public gas suppliers and there has to be a counterweight to these <e> <s> security payments are one <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened carefully to what the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon has just said and what he said in committee <e> <s> if for a moment i may perhaps have the attention of the noble lord lord bruce of donington i should like to say that we accept the amendment as it stands and also the consequential amendment amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord stoddart said that he understood the purpose of standing charges but that the general public would no doubt accept his amendment <e> <s> i shall seek to convince the noble lord and the general public if anybody is listening which i rather doubt at this hour of the evening that there is a good and valid reason for making standing charges <e>", "<cs> my lords clause provides that the prices to be charged by a public gas supplier for the supply of gas by him shall be in accordance with tariffs that are to be fixed by him <e> <s> this requirement on a public gas supplier is a relevant requirement which is enforced by the director under clause <e> <s> clause is however subject to subsection which enables a special agreement to be entered into if the tariffs are not appropriate owing to special circumstances or the supply is for more than therms a year <e>", "<cs> my lords regarding lord diamonds first amendment no <e> <s> a i think my noble friend lord belstead covered most of the ground on that when he said on the last amendment that where a statutory obligation is created the person on whom the obligation falls must foot the bill unless specific provision is made for the recovery of costs <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house yes the first amendment put forward by <e>", "<cs> my lords we touched on this in committee <e> <s> as was then pointed out paragraph is a new provision <e> <s> it recognises that in future gas may be supplied by another company but that british gas will remain by far the most familiar company in the mind of the public so that any escape might be reported to them <e> <s> i am sure that with their experience british gas can be relied upon in the circumstances to take whatever steps are appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords in moving that further consideration on report be now adjourned i suggest that we do not return to the consideration of this bill before ten minutes past eight <e>", "<cs> my lords we are at report stage and the noble lord has spoken once <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the concern that the director should be given time to consider a report and the need for advice to be given to the secretary of state <e> <s> i hope to persuade the noble lord that the regime established in the bill already caters for these matters <e> <s> the noble lords proposed new subsection would require the director to be sent a copy of the draft mmc report <e> <s> the noble lord also seeks to allow the director days to consider the mmcs report before sending a copy to the public gas supplier and the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords clause provides for the modification of the conditions of a public gas suppliers authorisation where the secretary of state by order exercises his powers under the specific parts of the competition act and the fair trading act following a report from the monopolies and mergers commission into a monopolies situation a merger reference or an anti-competitive practice relating to the supply of gas through pipes <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i did in fact respond to amendment no <e> <s> c in my original reply and i think the noble lord will find that when he reads what i said he will find that i have in fact given the reasons for the way this is set out <e> <s> i would also draw the noble lords attention to the government amendment which is coming up in a moment or two no <e> <s> e <e> <s> i think that also may be of assistance to him <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave i think it is consequential on the noble lords amendment no <e> <s> a to which i have replied <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment gives me an opportunity to explain why we have clause in the bill <e> <s> the purpose of this subsection is to require the director to build up expert knowledge about activities connected with the supply of gas through pipes so that he is in a position to carry out his functions on the basis of a real knowledge of the gas industry <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment gives us an opportunity to debate the role of the gas consumers council <e> <s> the duty of the council under clause is to investigate complaints relating to the supply of gas through pipes other than enforcement complaints which are for the director from both tariff and contract customers <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord diamond said that we had debated this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords nor do i find it a lifeline <e> <s> i shall not enter into an argument with the noble lord lord bruce about the merits or demerits of privatisation <e> <s> we have been through that many many times and no doubt we shall go through it again <e> <s> therefore i have nothing more to add to what i said on the previous occasion <e> <s> we cannot accept this amendment which seeks to fetter the secretary of states discretion in deciding the best time to make the vesting order and like the last time i must ask my noble friends to reject it <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a certain familiarity about these amendments in that they seek to bring parliament back into detailed arrrangements under the bill and we seem to have been over that ground on several occasions in various different aspects <e> <s> we have consistently argued that it is for parliament to debate the principles of the bill <e> <s> that is what we are doing now and what we have been doing for what seems to be a very long time indeed <e> <s> in the amendments which follow we shall be debating very fully the arrangements for vesting the corporations assets in the successor company and for the disposal of the shares when we come to an amendment in the name of noble lords opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords i was only two years old otherwise i think i would have been <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord indicated this amendment gives the house an opportunity to debate the special share <e> <s> i am aware that the view has been expressed that the special shareholding that we propose that the secretary of state should have in british gas ought in some way to be given statutory expression <e> <s> however i assure the noble lord that such is not common practice and that it is indeed quite unnecessary given that what is achieved through the special share is entrenched when established in the articles and it can be changed only by the initiative of the special shareholder himself <e> <s> there is however some difference between us as to the extent of control which it is appropriate to exert through the special share and i shall try to explain to noble lords why we believe that what the government propose is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house as the noble lord says the special share would be redeemable at any time at the option of the holder that is the government after consulting british gas <e> <s> thus at any time the government could remove the entrenched status of the limitation on shareholdings provision <e> <s> but they would obviously do so only if they were satisfied that this would be in the national interest <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendments moved by the noble lord seem to show that he has no confidence in the governments ability to handle these matters on their own <e> <s> he will not be surprised that i fundamentally disagree with him on that <e> <s> the secretary of state is the guardian of the existing nationalised gas industry and it is right that he should have the power with the treasury to issue securities and to determine the value of the shares in the nationalised industrys successor <e>", "<cs> my lords i can deal very briefly with this <e> <s> as the noble lord moved the amendment very briefly he will not be surprised at the brief answer that i have to give him <e> <s> it is that the purpose of this subsection is to prevent the purchase back of british gas shares through the means here referred to <e> <s> if the noble lords party come to power at some stage in the future and they wish to renationalise british gas they will have to do it through primary legislation and not through the means of purchasing shares in the market <e>", "<cs> my lords of course this is an identical amendment to one which was put down at committee stage <e> <s> we had a reasonably long debate on it at that stage and i am afraid that my views have not changed one little bit since then <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has explained and i am grateful to my noble friend lady gardner of parkes for her comment the amendment requires the corporation to prepare accounts for the year ended st march and for any subsequent period in accordance with a prescribed accounting principle namely current cost convention <e> <s> it requires also that those accounts should include prescribed detailed financial statements statistics and ratios that go well beyond the requirement of the companies act <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to finish what i am saying if the noble lord does not mind <e> <s> he has an opportunity to speak after me <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that at the moment i do not have that information but i will endeavour to find out if they are due in the near future and let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord foot has made many interesting points in his remarks and i must express sympathy with at least some of them <e> <s> but we must beware of trying in this bill to usurp what are properly matters for competition legislation <e> <s> i can foresee two dangers in this <e> <s> first as more lenders enter the mortgage market it would be wrong and unfair to shackle building societies with too many restrictions that do not apply to others <e>", "<cs> on the last point surely the evidence if there is any will come from those who feel aggrieved that is to say the independent insurance broker or the estate agent <e> <s> if they find that their local building society is doing something that they consider should be brought to the attention of the office of fair trading they are the ones who will bring it to the office of fair trading <e> <s> it obviously will not be the customer who thinks he is getting a good deal <e> <s> i think that is the way that would operate <e>", "<cs> the noble lord makes a good point <e> <s> i am well aware that not only this bill but also other bills are liable to put extra work on to the office of fair trading <e> <s> i would very much hope i can go no further than that this afternoon that indeed the noble lords anxieties will be satisfied in that the office of fair trading will be well enough staffed to cope with this kind of problem <e> <s> i must say straight away that in this particular case i do not see that there will be much of a problem <e> <s> i do not see that there should be that much extra work for the office of fair trading <e> <s> that is not what i was trying to say on this occasion <e>", "<cs> as i stated when replying to the previous amendment we do not want to put building societies at a competitive disadvantage to their rivals in the home loans market <e> <s> as my noble friend lord morris said the building companies sometimes offer free conveyancing and there is nothing to prevent banks or other people who offer mortgages from doing the same <e> <s> i really do not think that in this respect to place on building societies a restriction which did not apply to others would be fair to them <e> <s> as i said in reply to the noble lord lord foot cross-subsidisation may frequently be a perfectly legitimate practice <e>", "<cs> i would make just two points to the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby <e> <s> firstly i think that on the whole the building societies seem to be going pretty willingly into this new legislation <e> <s> in fact the legislation has been worked out <e>", "<cs> the best that i can do i think is to consider it rather than to clarify it at the moment <e> <s> i shall certainly look into what the noble lord lord williams has suggested <e> <s> perhaps i could write to him if necessary if there is a problem here <e>", "<cs> my short answer to the noble lord is that there is the matter of judicial review which could be brought into operation on this aspect <e> <s> the commission will be publishing guidance as to how it interprets adequate sufficient etc <e> <s> those two points might help the noble lord <e> <s> i shall certainly read carefully what he has said and see if there is anything which needs to be done <e>", "<cs> yes i shall certainly look into that <e>", "<cs> certainly i will take that into account <e>", "<cs> i hope that neither the noble lord nor i will need to put down consequential amendments since i hope i shall be able to satisfy the noble lord lord williams of elvel with what i have to say <e> <s> i quite understand the fears that the noble lord has expressed and i hope that i may be able to reassure him <e>", "<cs> this of course is much the same as appears in the act <e> <s> perhaps i may try to explain how and when this power may have to be used <e> <s> if a society has issued advertising material which is for any reason undesirable it has generally been possible to get it withdrawn or modified <e> <s> we fully expect that to continue but we need statutory powers in the background <e>", "<cs> the noble lord makes a valuable point and hope that i shall be able to give him the answer for which he is looking <e> <s> the good functioning of the financial system requires that the different supervisors need to be able to share information on matters of common interest or where their responsibilities overlap <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that the director general of fair trading has supervisory responsibilities which properly bring him within that net <e>", "<cs> i would not want to stand up here and give the noble lord a clear assurance on that point at this stage without taking further advice which may or may not arrive before i sit down <e> <s> but what i think i said in answer to the noble lord lord foot was that these are not necessarily matters which would need the commissions intervention <e> <s> they would be matters between the aggrieved party and the building society in particular <e> <s> i am not certain how closely involved the commission would get in individual cases like that <e> <s> i shall certainly look into what the noble lord has said and will have to write to him on this point <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly have another look at it <e> <s> obviously one is in the hands of the parliamentary draftsman in these matters and this is what he has suggested in seeking as we hope the same aim that the noble lord seeks to achieve <e> <s> i shall certainly look to see whether we can improve upon the wording <e> <s> i give that undertaking <e>", "<cs> the idea of a panel of approved auditors whether for banks or building societies is not a new one <e> <s> it has been discussed and rejected many times by the inspectors appointed to investigate the grays building society and most recently last year by the report of the committee set up to consider the system of banking supervision under the chairmanship of the governor of the bank of england <e>", "<cs> clause <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly look into that point and perhaps i can get in touch with the noble lord on it <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord morris for his remarks <e> <s> we believe that the amendment is unnecessary and possibly misconceived <e> <s> it is misconceived because the auditors statutory duty is to the members with respect to the stewardship of members funds and the truth and fairness of the financial accounts and to the commission regarding the accounting records and systems of control of the business <e>", "<cs> i think that i shall have to rely on the professions auditing guidelines on building societies <e> <s> it should be for the profession to apply this to its members <e>", "<cs> before i reply to this amendment may i make a couple of remarks on the last amendment which may be helpful <e> <s> the commission will seek to see that there is a management letter and can demand to see it <e> <s> that may clarify the point <e>", "<cs> we believe that this amendment which requires auditors to consult the directors before making their annual report to the commission on the societys accounting records and systems of business control is at best unnecessary and i am afraid at worst undesirable <e> <s> the accountancy professions guidelines on building societies emphasise the importance of reporting significant weaknesses in internal controls to management and of ensuring that non-executive directors are made aware of these reports and recommends that auditors should attend board meetings to explain matters in the audit <e> <s> it seems to me to be wholly inappropriate to try to legislate from the fine detail of relationships between boards and auditors <e> <s> this is a matter best left to common sense and good practice <e>", "<cs> i did not want to miss the opportunity of replying on this occasion and accepting the noble lords amendment <e> <s> i should draw attention to one thing that i think the noble lord lord williams might have misheard in my reply to the last amendment <e> <s> i was not referring to guidelines to be sent <e>", "<cs> in the vast majority of situations communications between the auditors and the commission would be with the knowledge of the society <e> <s> this is the normal well-established position and the government have no wish to undermine traditional relationships between auditors and their clients <e> <s> but there needs to be provision for exceptional circumstances where the auditor may need to alert the commission to a particular situation and where informing the societys management would not suffice to secure the protection of investors <e>", "<cs> these are new provisions <e>", "<cs> what i meant when i said reserve power was in reference to subsection of amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> what i am saying is that the power to make an order under this subsection is exercisable by statutory instrument which shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either house of parliament <e> <s> in other words it must come to parliament before it can be used <e>", "<cs> there was a good debate on this subject at second reading and now the noble lord lord barnett has given us his views on the subject <e> <s> this is a new feature of building society legislation and it was the subject of most careful and extensive consultation before it reached this chamber <e> <s> the issue was thoroughly aired in the green paper of july which preceded this bill but it was also the subject of a detailed consultation paper in december of last year <e> <s> so the government have taken great care to canvass views as widely as possible <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord barnett decides what to do i may say that i am grateful to the noble lord lord houghton and to my noble friend lord campbell of croy <e> <s> i will respond to the point raised by my noble friend lord morris which was in one respect answered by the noble lord lord houghton when he stated that building societies might be happier under company law than under the proposals in the bill <e>", "<cs> i can go a little further than i did in moving the amendment <e> <s> the government are concerned that adequate safeguards should exist to secure that conversions happen for reasons for commercial development and are not decided by the prospect of possible short-term financial gains <e> <s> as the government have also made clear ever since they published their consultative document on building society conversion in december last year it is important that the conversion provisions work to prevent speculative flows between societies on rumours of an impending conversion <e> <s> i gather that is what happened in america in certain situations and that is what we seek to avoid happening in this sort of situation <e>", "<cs> this is part of a larger aspect of how building societies might become plcs <e> <s> there are certain safeguards attached to the conversion in so far as if the building society wishes to offer its members incentives to convert to a plc in order to avoid a flow of funds out of one building society into another because a rumour might have started that a building society was about to turn itself into a plc and offer its members cash bonuses members must have been members for two years before they can benefit from this <e> <s> this is covered elsewhere in the bill but this is an oversight in one particular aspect of it <e>", "<cs> as far as i know from the bill this completes the whole series <e> <s> there was a technical oversight on this particular aspect and this should close all the gaps <e>", "<cs> certainly <e> <s> i think a gremlin crept into the printing of the first marshalled list <e> <s> if the noble lord will turn his attention to subsection he will find that the last word of the first line was originally printed as the when it should have been this <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord williams of elvel particularly for his toleration of the huge number of government amendments <e> <s> i am glad that we were able to produce notes on the amendments for his use <e> <s> i undertake that there will be far far fewer amendments from the government at report stage <e> <s> nevertheless we shall still produce notes on them for noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement being made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the reception to the statement given by the noble lord lord bruce of donington and in particular by the noble lord lord gladwyn <e> <s> i am not quite so grateful to the noble lord lord bruce of donington i must confess <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lord lord obrien the vat ceiling of per cent <e> <s> is fixed again for next years budget <e> <s> but as i said earlier this is up for review in <e> <s> this government do not believe that the ceiling should need to rise above per cent <e> <s> and we shall be making those views very clear at the start of negotiations <e>", "<cs> well my lords i think the per cent <e> <s> depreciation of the dollar was a fairly exceptional movement in currencies but in general i can only repeat what was said in the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lady elles <e> <s> in fact it is better than that it is only just under per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord john-mackie <e> <s> the noble lord has the better of me <e> <s> he has the figures in his head but i am afraid that i do not have the figures at all <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon asked me three questions <e> <s> the answer to the first one is yes <e> <s> in his second question the noble lord quoted some figures in comparision with the retail price index <e> <s> i have no doubt that he has done his sums he will be able to do them just as well as i can <e> <s> this is a european matter <e> <s> i am not quite sure what is the overall rpi in europe but it is probably much the same as our own <e> <s> if the dollar now appreciates instead of depreciating that will of course have good effects with regard to cap expenditure <e> <s> i am afraid that i cannot tell the noble lord at the moment what will happen to any surplus that arises from that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until five minutes past eight oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord lucas of chilworth i beg to move the motion standing in his name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord houghton <e> <s> with the leave of the house i should like to say that i have no knowledge yet of whether such a person has been found <e> <s> certainly he has not yet been appointed <e> <s> three of the four part-time appointments have been made <e> <s> i shall certainly <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments appear to the government to be entirely sensible and make the bill clearer <e> <s> i therefore have much pleasure in accepting them <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first say to the noble lord lord houghton that i have not seen the building societies association brief on his amendment and so i hope that when i now give the governments view on it i shall not be repeating merely what has been written down in that <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i say that i have not got the answer to the noble baronesss question <e> <s> i do not know how many people there are involved as both borrowing and investing members <e> <s> however of course there are reasons why it is practical to be both <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may briefly explain the provisions of this paragraph <e> <s> as at present drafted the bill allows societies to impose restrictions as to the length of membership and minimum shareholding for a member before he may propose a resolution <e> <s> sub-paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am grateful to my noble friend lady gardner of parkes for having drawn the governments attention to a possible difficulty in the bill as it was worded <e> <s> i am happy to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord houghton for raising this question <e> <s> the procedures by which building societies elect directors have given rise to much comment and controversy in the past and the noble lord lord williams of elvel has just touched on that point <e> <s> it is important that the boards of building societies should be properly accountable to the membership <e> <s> this is not only to give ordinary members the chance of a say in the running of their society <e> <s> it is an important discipline on the management of any organisation to know that it must explain its actions to those to whom it is accountable <e>", "<cs> my lords i have of course listened with great interest to what the noble lord lord houghton has said but i am bound to tell him at the start that the government cannot accept these amendments <e> <s> as with all the provisions governing the rights of members to participate in the affairs of their society there is a fine balance to be struck between the legitimate democratic aspirations of members on the one hand and the imposition of unreasonable burdens on the societies on the other <e> <s> in this particular case the question is what is the minimum shareholding a member should have in order to be able automatically to exercise full membership rights <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord williams for raising this issue again today <e> <s> it is a matter of considerable importance both to individual borrowers and to the future development of the mortgage market <e> <s> it is quite right therefore that we should debate it again today <e>", "<cs> my lords we accept that there may be an advantage in the added flexibility these amendments will give on the security for mobile home loans in england and wales <e> <s> therefore we are pleased to accept the amendments <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend and to the building societies association for suggesting these changes <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend suggests that the phrase by way of lease is redundant <e> <s> i am sorry to say that i cannot agree with her on this occasion <e> <s> a society needs power to sell land whatever its description <e> <s> for example if it acquires a plot of land which it develops primarily for a residen-tial use it sells the parcels of residential land and will be left with a parcel of land for other use <e> <s> it must be able to sell that also <e> <s> this amendment will stop it doing so <e> <s> as it stands the clause enables it to sell that non-residential parcel of land but not to lease it <e> <s> that is the desired effect of it <e> <s> the clause enables it to sell or to lease the primarily residential parcels of land <e> <s> i hope with that explanation my noble friend will agree to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for raising this point although the amendment would not i am advised achieve the effect that she desires <e> <s> if it was desired to make the schedule powers available to other associated bodies amendments would be needed to part iii of schedule where the current restrictions to subsidiaries occur rather than to clause <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord williams will of course have an opportunity next friday when we discuss the finance bill to go into the more general aspects of personal equity plans and whether they are a good thing <e> <s> in answer to his three questions yes the building society or subsidiary involved in this matter will have to be authorised by an sro or receive direct authorisation from the sib according to the terms of the financial services legislation which is currently before us <e> <s> the life assurance and unit trust regulatory organisation will more than likely be the one to apply <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i believe that i can answer both noble lords at once <e> <s> the answer to the noble lord lord diamond is surely yes otherwise there would be no point in providing building societies with this power <e> <s> in answer to the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby we are not of course forcing any building society to take this power or any other power in schedule <e> <s> it will be a matter for them <e> <s> we are merely giving them the power to do so if they wish <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to what my noble friend has said <e> <s> these are quite complex provisions of the schedule <e> <s> it may well be that my noble friend and the building societies association have a point here <e> <s> but because the provisions are complex there is a need to tread carefully with any proposed changes particularly at this late stage of the bills progress <e> <s> as with an earlier amendment moved by my noble friend the government would like to look further at the point in consultation with the building societies association <e> <s> the mechanism exists in the bill for this provision to be amended by order if it proved a problem <e> <s> i hope therefore that my noble friend will be prepared to allow the government to pursue the matter in this way and will withdraw her amendment <e> <s> i am grateful to her for having raised the point <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to my noble friend most of the questions that he has asked and the points that he has made would have been better put to my noble and learned friend the <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i think that i answered my noble friends first question when i said that no progress could be made <e> <s> if no acceptable rules could be agreed between my noble and learned friend and those likely to be affected by the powers in schedule it would be a sticking point nothing more could happen <e>", "<cs> my lords what i said in committee was that this subsection is declaratory <e> <s> that is not quite the same as saying that it serves no purpose <e> <s> if it were removed it might be arguable that the reference in subsection to the consideration payable for each service implied that some consideration must be paid for each service and that none could be offered free of charge <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with interest to the speeches of the noble lord lord houghton and the noble lord lord williams <e> <s> however i hope that i shall be able to persuade them that the existing provisions in the bill are sufficiently flexible to allow for the sort of situation described although the noble lord lord houghton has already said that whatever i say will not satisfy him unless i <e>", "<cs> my lords the government entirely accept that the other interests of directors where they are of posssible relevance to the business of the society should not be swept under the carpet that is why we have introduced a number of clauses of which this is one based on provisions in the companies act <e> <s> indeed where we have thought it appropriate in the special circumstances of building societies we have gone further than the companies act for example the provision of clause and schedule in respect of the disclosure and record of income of related businesses of directors <e> <s> i can therefore confirm at the outset that there is nothing between the government and the noble lord opposite as indicated by adaptation of companies act provisions on the need for interests of directors to be adequately brought out <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i can give the noble lord the assurance that in this case may means shall though i must admit that i would not want to go into the argument about may and shall any deeper than that <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope very much that on this occasion i may be able to satisfy the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby even if i do not go as far as accepting the amendment <e> <s> the government informed the federation of building society staff associations in mid-may that they accept the appropriateness of extending to building societies requirements corresponding to those in section of the employment act which provisions i should perhaps record are now consolidated into schedule to the companies act <e> <s> these require companies with more than employees to report annually on the development of their arrangements for providing regular information to employees for consulting them and for involving them in the companys affairs <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord williams of elvel for having moved the amendment and i was also most interested to hear the speech of the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> as the noble lord lord williams mentioned we had a debate on this subject in committee and the noble lord made his views clearly known on that occasion <e> <s> i have no doubt that when we come to deal with the financial services bill we shall again have an opportunity to air different views <e> <s> i am absolutely willing to accept the amendments in the name of the noble lord lord williams of elvel <e> <s> he has made the very good point that it should be done by an affirmative resolution so that both houses have the chance to debate such an order if it were brought forward <e> <s> therefore i have much pleasure in accepting the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment seeks to do two things <e> <s> perhaps i may deal first with the second limb which is the simpler <e> <s> i am advised that it is unnecessary to provide explicitly for determinations not to have general application <e> <s> the requirement in the bill is only for each determination to relate to the particular case in question <e> <s> in particu-lar a direction not to enforce any particular term of contract will apply only to that case it will not necessarily prohibit enforcement in other cases <e> <s> it will be open to the ombudsman to comment in his annual report on general questions such as the operation of particular provisions by particular societies but he will have direct powers of intervention only in specific cases <e>", "<cs> my lords building society staff are already protected under the transfer of undertakings protection of employment regulations which will have become very familiar to your lordships over the last week or so <e> <s> these provide them with the same protection in the event of a transfer of undertakings as employees of <e>", "<cs> my lords the reference to building societies in this clause is deliberately included <e> <s> it ties the provision into schedule which gives building societies power to offer conveyancing services which they would not otherwise enjoy <e> <s> it is anticipated moreover that building societies because of their particular interest and place in the housing market should be mentioned specifically as the kind of institution who wish to offer conveyancing services <e> <s> the reference in this clause may not be strictly necessary but it exists as a guide to the intention of the legislation <e> <s> tempting though it may be to try and show the parliamentary counsel have for once got it wrong i think on this occasion my noble friend should bow to their endeavours <e> <s> i therefore invite him to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend that these are not government amendments which the noble baroness has been moving <e> <s> i understand they have been suggested to her by the building societies association although the noble baroness speaks on her own behalf <e> <s> nevertheless i have great pleasure in accepting this particular one <e>", "<cs> my lords under the revised proposals announced in another place by my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer on th june charities will be able to accumulate income for genuine charitable purposes without loss of tax relief <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a difficult estimate to give because it depends very much on the uptake of the various schemes which the government proposed in the budget <e> <s> however a figure of million has been given as an estimate for next year and it could possibly be more <e>", "<cs> my lords there is always a difficult problem about how much consultation can take place before a budget especially when one is trying to bring forward measures to curb abuse <e> <s> if one consults too widely before announcing measures to curb abuse obviously the bird is apt to fly from the nest <e> <s> fortunately of course consultations have taken place since then and now everyone seems to be reasonably happy <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give an answer to that <e> <s> the charity commission is a different question to that on the order paper which concerns the inland revenue and tax relief <e>", "<cs> my lords that question goes rather wider than the question on the order paper but i should point out that the budget gave a further estimated million vat relief to charities <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much hope that two leaflets are being published today i have not received confimation whether they have yet gone out explaining tax relief which is available to individuals and businesses <e> <s> i hope that charities will collect the leaflets and use them to their advantage <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the noble lords second point he has his views on that <e> <s> on his first point regarding the employee payroll scheme the inland revenue has published a prospectus for that it did so i believe on th june <e> <s> that gives the suggestions for the scheme and there will be a further draft to the detailed rules which will be published shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that supplementary question and i entirely agree with her <e>", "<cs> i think that we have reached a suitable moment to adjourn <e> <s> in moving that the house do now resume perhaps i may suggest that we do not return to the committee stage of this bill until eight oclock <e> <s> i beg to

about my noble friend lord skelmersdale and myself during the passage of the bill <e> <s> i shall draw the remarks of the noble lord lord gallacher to the attention of my right honourable friend the chancellor and the chief registrar of friendly societies <e> <s> i cannot say any more than that at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> i beg to move

lord graham of edmonton for his explanation of the amendment <e> <s> i am bound to say however that we do not believe that it would be appropriate to consult organisations representing employees <e> <s> there is possibly a misunderstanding about the primary purpose of the tribunal <e> <s> the tribunal is to consider issues directly affecting the business yet there is no requirement that organisations representing investment business should be consulted nor should there be <e> <s> the tribunal will not be adjudicating between employers and employees <e> <s> there is no need for its composition to strike a balance between them <e> <s> it would not be appropriate therefore for the secretary of state to consult employee representatives or other outside interests before making appointments to the panel <e>", "<cs> i should like to intervene <e> <s> i want to make it clear that i did not say the operation of clause was not covered with the tribunal <e> <s> if the noble lord understood me to say that i must correct that straight away <e> <s> clause s disqualification directions against employers is only one of the categories of case which can be referred to the tribunals <e> <s> clause cases may not be adjudicating between employer and employee <e> <s> they will be considering his conduct and whether he has complied with the rules <e> <s> i should like to make that quite clear <e>", "<cs> i am happy to say that the noble lord has made a very good case indeed for his amendment <e> <s> we are very pleased to be able to accept it <e>", "<cs> at present i am not quite sure to what the noble lord was referring when he suggested that we were to revise the schedule but i shall certainly look into the matter <e> <s> i have to say that in any case we cannot sympathise with the main drift of the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say to the noble lord lord morton of shuna that the intention in the bill as drafted is precisely as he has just described in that it should be reported as soon as possible <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble lord for having moved the amendment because it expresses the position in better words than the bill as drafted at present <e> <s> therefore once more i am pleased to accept the noble lords amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in moving that the house do now resume i suggest that we do not return to further consideration in committee on this bill until eight oclock <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> i had a fairly long speech to make in order to persuade the committee why it should not accept the amendment or both amendments <e> <s> at the same time i intended to draw the attention of the committee to the government amendments that we shall reach in a minute or two and which will achieve a better result than the amendments that the noble lord lord williams has just moved <e> <s> as it is the noble lord has merely invited me to define competition as it applies to the bill and that i shall attempt to do <e> <s> i am certain that i shall think of other things after i have sat down that i should have better added <e>", "<cs> the noble lord will not get himself far if he does go on talking <e> <s> i think i have given a description of what sort of competitive aspects will be taken into account in operating this part of the bill <e> <s> i suggest that this is as far as i can go at the moment <e>", "<cs> i certainly will if it adds anything to what i have already said <e>", "<cs> we shall have to wait and see <e>", "<cs> i am not a party to the luncheons which take place between the noble lord and the director general of fair trading but the director has been consulted and the provisions which we are discussing have his full support <e> <s> the internal staffing of the office of fair trading is a matter for the director and we have the fullest confidence in the staff to carry out their functions <e> <s> we shall listen carefully to any representations that he makes to us if indeed he feels that he has to make any <e>", "<cs> i have little to add to what i said <e> <s> we have discussed this with the director and we have his full support <e> <s> we shall listen carefully to any representations that he makes to us for extra staff if indeed he does so <e> <s> i am afraid that i can go no further than that at the moment <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord explained the amendment is aimed at greatly extending the potential scope of a modest provision which is designed to do no more than retain our flexibility to exercise our option under article of the ec admission directive to apply the directive to open-ended collective investment undertakings <e> <s> at present we have exercised that option the other way because uk unit trusts have not normally sought admission to listing but it is prudent to retain the possibility to change <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if i have misunderstood the noble lords interpretation of his amendment <e> <s> i have given our interpretation of what the effect of it would be <e> <s> i stand by what i said <e> <s> i shall look into what he said to see whether such a provision may be necessary but i cannot give any commitment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord suggests that this part of the bill will cause unnecessary disruption and that we should continue to rely on the stock exchange listing regulations to implement the ec listing directives in this country <e> <s> the listing directives had to be implemented within a tight timetable which meant that we had to use section of the european communities act and proceed by secondary legislation <e> <s> that imposed limitations on what could be done and it was not possible to deal satisfactorily with certain matters for example the stock exchange listing rules the yellow book are in many ways stricter than the minimum standards contained in the directives <e> <s> the directives allow much stricter requirements to be imposed but the european communities act did not allow the stock exchange to be empowered to impose additional legal requirements going beyond the directives which could throw doubt on the validity of the yellow book <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord hacking moved the amendment as if it was <e>", "<cs> we have obviously listened to representations made to us especially by such eminent people <e> <s> in answer to the noble lords amendment may i first say that the government had no wish to make official listing a statutory matter <e> <s> but as was feared at the time when the european community directives which part iv seeks to implement were being negotiated and as the subsequent jurisprudence of the european court of justice has confirmed community law requires directives of this kind to be turned into binding national provisions <e> <s> mere administrative action will not do <e> <s> there is scope for debate on exactly how far one has to go in certain areas <e> <s> on a number of points the government have sought to accommodate the wishes of the stock exchange to the limit of what community law can possibly be interpreted as allowing <e> <s> we were happy to do that and we certainly do not want to do anything that could adversely affect the pre-eminence of the united kingdom as a financial centre <e> <s> but the fundamental proposition that the directives have to be given a legal basis in the united kingdom is i believe accepted <e> <s> that being so one has to carry the logic through and if one tries to avoid it in one area the only effect will be transfer the strain elsewhere <e>", "<cs> i must admit that i should have thought the sense of the amendment was fairly clear and was what we were aiming to achieve <e> <s> i would hesitate to argue with the noble lord as a lawyer about the meaning of the word reasonableness <e> <s> i had understood that it was reasonably acceptable in legal jargon <e> <s> however i shall certainly take note of what the noble lord said and if there is any improvement which could be made without any commitment whatsoever i shall have a look at it <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to say that i shall be able to respond to the noble lord lord hacking considerably more briefly that i did on the previous amendment <e> <s> i compliment him on the sharpness of his eye and note that his amendment restores the word used in article of the relevant directive and i can readily accept it <e>", "<cs> i sympathise with the notion that the issuers should not be liable for trivial omission of material required by listing or prospectus rules but the bill as we propose to amend it already contains various devices to prevent this <e> <s> first the requirement that the purchaser should have suffered loss imports a materiality test and should preclude claims based on technical breaches <e> <s> secondly the noble lords own amendment amendment no <e> <s> a which i am bound to say we prefer to our own amendment amendment no <e> <s> which i shall not be moving allows insurers to omit irrelevant information about incurring liability in certain circumstances <e> <s> thirdly it is also necessary to consider the defences which i shall be moving amendments to later to augment further <e> <s> we have thus moved a considerable way to recognise issuers difficulties <e> <s> to remove liability for breaches of the rules goes too far in my opinion and could prejudice investor protection <e> <s> apart from the general principle that investors should have the same redress for losses caused by breaches of <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord hacking for speaking to these amendments and for alerting the department that the amendments were to be moved thus enabling us to come up with some response to them at very short notice <e> <s> i shall deal with them as quickly as i possibly can <e>", "<cs> yes i agree with the noble lord lord hacking and i am grateful to him for having brought these matters forward <e> <s> we would certainly accept amendment no <e> <s> a and when we come to it amendment no <e> <s> h and i have indicated to him that we are willing to look in detail at all the other amendments that he has moved <e>", "<cs> i think that if the lord chairman called the amendment with the error put right that would be how the committee was considering it and therefore we could accept it as it is <e>", "<cs> i must advise the committee to reject these amendments <e> <s> i would stress that as far as the first and second amendments are concerned i do so purely on practical grounds and not from any objections of principle <e> <s> indeed i can readily subscribe to the thinking behind them <e> <s> my case is simply that they are not necessary to achieve the desired result <e> <s> so far as concerns amendment no <e> <s> a i considered carefully whether there should be power for an approved exchange to derogate from the general duty <e> <s> i have to say that i am not satisfied that a case has been made out <e>", "<cs> i have strong reservations about this amendment <e> <s> it would open a considerable loophole in part v a prospectus would be required only for a secondary offer if the issuers as well as the intermediary intended that the securities would be on-sold <e>", "<cs> clause has been made redundant by amendments nos <e> <s> to to which the committee has agreed <e>", "<cs> the need for clause disappeared with the committees acceptance of the group of amendments which were dealt with when i moved amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i therefore oppose the question that clause shall stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> i think that we have reached a suitable moment to resume the house <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> the committee will i think be glad to hear that i am not going to quote the interpretation act at the noble lord lord hacking not that i am sure that the committee would not like to hear what he has to say about it <e> <s> it is far simpler to say to the noble lord that while i do not for a moment think that the wording at present in the bill is unsatisfactory i always welcome suggestions as to how the wording can be made better <e> <s> this is one of them <e> <s> i am pleased to accept the noble lords amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord graham of edmonton for having moved this amendment <e> <s> i agree with him that it is desirable that the secretary of state or the agency should have the function of giving or publishing information and advice and if it were to be transferred to the agency then the agency could fund it out of statutory fee income and would be covered by the immunity from damages in clause <e> <s> but i am bound to say that my advice is that the amendment as it stands would not enable the functions to be transferred from the secretary of state to the agency <e> <s> indeed there may be other points in the amendment that we should like to look at <e> <s>

the noble lord lord hacking for having brought this matter to our attention <e> <s> i understand that the law society has also been concerned with this <e>", "<cs> we have had a most interesting exchange of views on this amendment and i am grateful to the noble lord lord hacking for having raised the point <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord williams will be happy to know that i am not going to accept this amendment outright and i did not intend to do so even before the noble lord made his most useful contribution <e> <s> i accept that there is a <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> in

<e>", "<cs> certainly not my lords <e> <s> it merely indicates the success of my predecessor in his promotion <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are straying somewhat from the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his kind words <e> <s> he asks whether this situation is already out of hand <e> <s> as i understand it there has been no request as yet from the regional council which is responsible for traffic regulation conditions to the traffic commissioner to determine appropriate traffic regulations <e> <s> of course that power is there if it is needed and that would also apply in other parts of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is of course quite right <e> <s> we were told during the passage of the transport act that all the buses would disappear from the streets <e> <s> it appears that exactly the opposite has happened <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his words of congratulation <e> <s> i am sorry that his noble friend lord carmichael has been held up in glasgow <e> <s> i am glad that it was through no fault of the government we are still not responsible for the weather <e> <s> as i said in my first answer it is for the regional council if it feels that there is a problem with traffic to apply to the traffic commissioner for traffic regulation conditions <e> <s> as yet i undersand that it has not done so <e>", "<cs> my lords i would agree entirely <e> <s> the traffic commissioner has power to take effective action against those who behave dangerously on the roads as do the police if drivers are caught breaking the speed limit or doing some such thing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord lord carmichael is no longer delayed by the fog <e> <s> as i said in answer to an earlier supplementary question it is within the capability of the regional council of the area to apply to the traffic commissioner for a traffic regulation condition if it thinks that that would help to solve the problem <e> <s> i understand that so far it has not done so <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland is keeping in close touch with the competition situation in glasgow and elsewhere <e> <s> if there were any evidence of anti-competitive behaviour or if such evidence emerged the government would take appropriate action if necessary and doubtless the office of fair trading would do so as well <e>", "<cs> my lords the united kingdom international passenger and freight ferries have for a long time been in a generally

sea containers were to try to sell sealink <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a good future for our ferry services <e> <s> sealink operates on nearly all its routes in intense competition with other companies so the future of the ferry services is not in doubt <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i understand that the county council spent a considerable amount of money on publicity <e> <s> i can tell my noble friend that they have saved in the region of million in subsidy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the full implications of the act so far as concerns lancashire are that they have completed

that i cannot answer that question specifically but i am assured that even if there was a complete breakdown rather than a controlled shutdown as this was at no time would aircraft safety be

todays edition of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not at present able to say whether it was raised at that meeting but i am able to tell the noble baroness that the commissions legal action under article against the major community airlines will begin to bite <e> <s> in june we announced our intention of reviewing the procedures necessary to enable us to apply the competition rules ourselves under article if the council failed to reach a satisfactory settlement <e> <s> however i am bound to say that action under either article presents the grim prospect of protracted legal action leading

route already appears on charts issued by the hydrographer of the navy <e>", "<cs> my lords i most certainly agree with my noble friend <e> <s> it is a very good thing if investors take a close interest in the companies in which they have bought shares <e> <s> they should read the annual reports and do their best to encourage those companies to act efficiently <e>", "<cs> my lords that may well be the case but i think my noble friends question refers to shares in quoted uk companies <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the public do not need telling by me or by the noble lord but i am very happy to give the warning that share prices can go down as well as up <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord makes a good point <e> <s> nevertheless we encourage the formation of employee share ownership schemes and we have in fact been very successful in that <e> <s> in there were only such schemes there are now over <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the opportunities for borrowing against share purchase are not particularly widespread in any case <e> <s> however obviously one must put ones priorities in the right order and invest in shares only when one can afford to do so <e>", "<cs>

done so and i gave the answer to that question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure that there is such a thing as a specific definition of a small shareholder <e> <s> as regards private shareholders as opposed to institutional shareholders i gave that figure in my original answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that that is the case in government share offers <e> <s> i think that that is particularly the case at present with british gas <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has put his finger on it but the question would then be what is the definition of a small number of shares

honourable friend the other day that we will certainly not compromise any further to get an agreement <e> <s> but i think that the proposal to go to in three years time as a first step before full liberalisation in is not a bad one <e> <s> if the council fails to agree we shall have to re-examine the various alternative courses and in particular to look to the commission to uphold the treaty

primarily for those companies that have reasonable access to the railway system and therefore can either build a siding from the main line to their factory or perhaps build some form of conveyor belt system <e> <s> if the factory is too far away from the railway and it requires road transport to and fro it would not be suitable for this scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords on the noble lords first question we keep the criteria for the grants under consideration <e> <s> the main criteria are that there should be worthwhile environmental benefits and that the traffic would otherwise go by road in the absence of a grant <e> <s> but we must not forget value for money and the fact that the grant is for capital expenditure only <e> <s> on the noble lords point about transhipment centres that is something i shall have to look into <e> <s> i do not have details of that with me at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my original answer it has been the policy of successive governments

available for inland waterways transport under section of the transport <e>", "<cs> the noble lord asks what we are doing about the situation my lords <e> <s> first we have this grant and since it came into operation over million tonnes of freight a year have been removed from unsuitable roads <e> <s> i should have thought we were doing something about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that my noble friend has had these experiences <e> <s> i trust that he will therefore draw attention to the possibility of these grants to any shipper who is involved in this sort of business and make sure that everyone knows they are available <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not have the figures for what proportion of coal transport moved to the roads during the miners strike has since returned to british rail <e> <s> british rail can compete successfully with road transport for the movement of coal and the more that goes back to rail the better <e> <s> on the other hand we know very well why the freight was transferred from railways to road and from that point of view the railways or their employees have only themselves to blame <e>", "<cs> not without notice my lords but i shall look into the matter and see whether i can find such figures <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are aware of the burden these charges impose both on the shipping industry and on united kingdom ports and are giving close consideration to means of reducing it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the point my noble friend makes <e> <s> it is true to say that we are the only western european country which charges light dues to users rather than the taxpayer <e> <s> as regards other classes of users we have looked into the possibility of charging yachtsmen but we recognise that would be administratively very difficult and would be unlikely to secure a positive benefit <e> <s> so far as charging fishing vessels is concerned we are considering that problem at the moment particularly in regard to the services of the decca navigation system <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that i am not entirely clear on the figure of to which the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale referred <e> <s> he spoke about the arthur anderson report which was issued some little time ago <e> <s> we are looking into this <e> <s> a further study is under way at the moment <e> <s> i shall make a statement on it in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords regarding the payment of light dues when the lighthouse authorities take over the operation of the decca navigation system there is an order currently before the house and i believe it will be debated before long <e>", "<cs> my lords it falls on all shipping which enters our ports whether they be foreign or british <e>", "<cs> my lords on my noble friends first point yes we are well aware of the difficulties this causes our ports in comparison with those of our continental competitors <e> <s> as far as the royal navy is concerned parliament decided in that the royal navy should not pay and that remains the position at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords light dues or the provision of lights currently costs about million in the current year of which the amount actually paid by users is some million <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to all noble lords who have taken part in this debate this afternoon <e> <s> it has certainly been a most interesting debate <e> <s> i was particularly glad that my noble friend lord strathcona and mount royal was able to speak with the authority of his role as honorary president of the united kingdom pilots association and of course the noble lord lord shackleton and the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale gave us the benefit of their knowledge as elder brethren of trinity house <e> <s> many other noble lords have also made most useful contributions <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point about which the noble lord asks <e> <s> that is what i am saying we must do some detailed work on this matter in a short space of time <e> <s> obviously if the noble lord is right trinity house would not be able to perform these agency services <e> <s> it is our intention that it should be able to perform these agency services so something must be done to make sure that is possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> it is for the traffic commissioner to decide whether he should reach a decision without holding an inquiry that would allow all the parties concerned to put their case <e> <s> the scottish traffic commissioner decided against acting without an inquiry <e> <s> in reaching that decision he noted that the severe congestion of th october when other factors were involved had not recurred <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly within the power of the office of fair trading to look into this matter <e> <s> it is for the commercial judgment of each operator to decide what services he runs <e> <s> operators will provide services according to the demands of the market <e> <s> this is the best way of ensuring that services reflect the needs of the travelling public which of course should be the paramount consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly take note of what my noble friend suggests and see what might be the best way of putting forward such information <e>", "<cs> my lords i gather that to some extent the problem has sorted itself out already <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable and learned friend the secretary of state for scotland is of course keeping in close touch with the competition aspect in glasgow and elsewhere <e> <s> if any evidence of anti-competitive behaviour emerges the government will take appropriate action <e> <s> also as i said earlier the oft can also look at the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be helpful at this stage if i intervene to give a brief indication of the governments view on the bill and on the amendment to the motion for the third reading <e> <s> the government are fully committed to the regeneration of london docklands <e> <s> this railway scheme would be a valuable aid in the process of regeneration and for that reason the government support this bill <e> <s> it is an essential preparation for the canary wharf development which would create major new job opportunities in docklands <e> <s> it would also increase the benefits provided by the railway already under construction <e>", "<cs> my lords i was going to come to that point later but i shall deal with it now since reference has also been made by the right reverend prelate to the fact that part of the proposed canary wharf development lies outside the enterprise zone and therefore comes within the normal development control processes <e> <s> these provide that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment may call in planning applications for his own determination <e> <s> i understand that a planning application in respect of the part of the canary wharf scheme outside the enterprise zone will shortly be referred to him as a departure from the development plan <e> <s> it will then be for him to decide whether or not he should call in the application for his own determination and if it were called in whether there should be an inquiry <e> <s> it would not be proper for me to anticipate my right honourable friends decision or even to comment on the merits of the application lest i prejudice his decision <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill would still go through but it might put doubt on the project which the bill is intended to put forward <e> <s> the noble lord lord hacking has already made that point i am sure he will wish to mention it again shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it is in my power to say when a reasonable time and place will occur <e> <s> it is for the house to decide <e> <s> i am merely giving my advice <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> the length of the contract is to be seven years extendable to years <e> <s> if after that time other systems have been developed it is possible that we might then have to make other arrangements <e> <s> the noble lord asked me particularly whether this would require a new order <e> <s> my understanding is that yes it would because as the noble lord clearly stated this order specifies the racal-decca system <e> <s> so if there was a decision at the end of seven or years to move to a new system it would require a new order <e> <s> i should like to emphasise that should we decide to move to a new system the maximum notice possible would be given to users of these sets so that they could acquire new sets <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord grimond is quite right <e> <s> there will be no difference in the system as it currently operates <e> <s> it is only a question of the receivers themselves which will no longer need to be rented from decca but which will be able to be purchased outright in future <e>", "<cs> my lords we have proposed that in the united kingdom vehicles first manufactured before st january should not have to carry tachographs <e> <s> we are also seeking to extend this to all vehicles that become years old if they do not carry more than nine people and are not used commercially <e> <s> we are preparing a statutory instrument which will be put to brussels for approval <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give an answer as to the date but we hope that it will not be too far away <e>", "<cs> my lords our existing arrangements with the soviet union provide for them to consider sympathetically requests from british airways british caledonian airways and cathay pacific airways to overfly soviet territory while operating services routed over north india between london and/or points in central europe on the one hand and delhi and/or bangkok and/or hong kong on the other hand <e> <s> we are now seeking arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the japanese further negotiations will be necessary fairly soon so they have not been drawn to a conclusion <e> <s> however provided they are soon brought to a satisfactory conclusion my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport hopes that the arrangements will be made sufficiently soon to enable british airways and british caledonian each to commence non-stop london to tokyo services on st april as they planned <e> <s> if the service comes into effect it will reduce the travelling time by up to six hours compared with the london-anchorage-tokyo route <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we have approached the soviet authorities <e> <s> it is not possible to be precise on the matter since agreement requires the consent of two parties and i can only speak for one of them <e> <s> i hope we shall reach mutually acceptable arrangements with the ussr within the next few weeks <e>", "<cs> my lords the possible wider use of wheelclamps is currently being examined by the committee chaired by dr peter north which is reviewing road traffic law <e> <s> the government will consider the findings and recommendations of that committee in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with the latter remarks of my noble friend <e> <s> regarding the level of fines the courts have a responsibility to consider the circumstances of each case and when passing sentence the means of the offender <e> <s> however we agree that the present average of for using or keeping an unlicensed vehicle on the road is inadequate as a punishment and a deterrent <e> <s> those views have been made plain on a number of occasions to the magistrates association and the other court representative bodies <e> <s> in addition to a fine a convicted offender is required to pay any back duty found to be owing <e> <s> however we are currently considering whether further measures are needed to strengthen the penalties against evasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the point made by the noble lord lord somers is one of the aspects that dr north will be examining in committee <e> <s> as i said at the moment it is not the case that a car which is unlicensed would be clamped just for that reason <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend will certainly take the noble earls views into account when we receive the report of the committee chaired by dr north <e> <s> we have of course not yet received it <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not say that there is no deterrent for people driving cars which are unlicensed <e> <s> over the past few years we have put a great deal of effort into improving enforcement in this regard <e> <s> for example last year revenue from enforce <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only say that i will draw my right honourable friends attention to the noble lords comments <e> <s> as i have said a review is currently taking place but we have not yet received the recommendations in a report <e>", "<cs> my lords the north committee has just issued the consultation document soliciting views and after considering these the committee hopes to report in the spring of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the federation of master builders is opposed to the black economy <e> <s> so too are the government <e> <s> as to any easing of the vat regime that is of course a matter for my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer <e> <s> i am sure that he will have studied this aspect but we have no plans at this stage to make changes <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are attempting to deal with the situation <e> <s> extra revenue staff will be redeployed to tackle evasion <e> <s> we plan an increase of around in that sphere <e> <s> we have recently announced plans to deploy an additional officers for vat control and investigation duties <e> <s> that brings the total additional staff deployed over the past four years to more than so the government do take this matter seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords if a person is paid in cash that of course is difficult to check on <e> <s> however in that situation i should point out that where a person buys supplies from shops if he is not registered for vat the vat is in fact collected <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we agree with the noble lord that this is a difficult problem to tackle <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> that is a point i had not appreciated <e> <s> i will certainly draw the attention of my right honourable friend to that aspect <e>", "<cs> my lords that suggestion goes a little wider than the question on the order paper <e> <s> it certainly goes a little wider than the brief i have been given this afternoon <e> <s> however i will certainly bear it in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not necessarily able to accept the figure of billion that has been quoted <e> <s> obviously the fact that it is the black economy about which we are talking makes it very difficult to give any kind of figure <e> <s> estimates vary from as high as per cent <e> <s> down to as little as per cent <e> <s> of the gross domestic product <e> <s> however as i said in my original answer we have received the report to which reference has been made and we have noted its recommendations <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly all of us on this side of the house wish to get the rate of taxation down <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not be drawn into an argument about where the centre of london should be <e> <s> what the new note issued by the department tries to point out is that one needs to strike a balance so as to achieve good access to town centres <e> <s> it emphasises the need for full and early consultation with interested organisations particularly with groups representing mobility-handicapped people and it advises on the consideration of vehicle exemptions including orange badge holders loading and unloading and security carriers <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not seen the scheme to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> i shall of course have a look at it and then decide what to do <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> my noble friend is quite right and that is one of the points which the draft note from the department emphasises <e> <s> a balance should be struck between good access to town centres and the need to have pedestrian precincts <e>", "<cs> certainly my lords <e> <s> the draft note is in the consultation period at present and we hope to publish the results in the spring <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount is quite correct and that is why a balance needs to be struck <e>", "<cs> my lords i have said that i shall take note of what the noble lord lord northfield said and i look forward to having a look at this scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords the first problems the most important problems to be tackled initially will be the installation of radio facilities for the police at key stations more and improved closed circuit television monitoring passenger alarms on the platforms making staff more accessible to assist the public and improvements to station environments including better lighting <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that it will be important to consult the trade unions as we go through the remaining recommendations in the report <e> <s> as to how parliament should be informed of their implementation i am not too sure <e> <s> i am however sure that should the noble lord wish to put down a question at some future date i could keep him up to date with how we are getting along <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly take the point of the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i hope that the exchange in your lordships house today will add to public awareness of this problem <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> there are regulations governing the fitting and replacement of silencers which will apply progressively to an increasing number of motor cycles in use <e> <s> in addition my right honourable friend the member for christchurch has introduced a private members bill in the other place enabling the secretary of state to make regulations controlling replacement of silencers at the point of sale <e> <s> the government very much welcome this initiative <e>", "<cs> my lords the enforcement of the existing limits is by no means non-existent <e> <s> in the last year for which i have statistics there were prosecutions for noise offences of which per cent <e> <s> resulted in a conviction <e> <s> the new regulations will make it easier to bring prosecutions because replacement silencers will have a mark on them and it will be very much easier for the police to see whether or not they are in order <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord obviously did not understand me very clearly <e> <s> in the last year for which i have figures there were prosecutions for noise offences by motor cyclists <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no reason why a motor cyclist has to buy an exhaust from the manufacturer of the motor cycle <e> <s> the replacement exhaust could possibly be cheaper but it must be as good in quality as the original <e>", "<cs> my lords the new european community directive covers only new motor cycles but-the new regulations and the new bill that has been introduced will of course cover all replacement silencers <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the first question of the noble baroness the council secretariat did issue a press release reproducing my right honourable friends summing up at the december council <e> <s> that press release was made available throughout the community and i understand that copies are available in the library <e> <s> as regards the action of the commission against the airlines i am not at present aware of the current state of progress in that matter <e> <s> it is a matter for the commission <e> <s> however i do understand that british caledonian was removed from that list <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not have the answer to that question <e> <s> i shall look into the matter and write to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords no not the two countries with which we ended up and to which i referred in my original answer <e> <s> i do not know which they were <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already said that i do not know at the moment <e> <s> i shall certainly find out which they are and write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said originally that was a matter for the commission <e> <s> i am now in a position to tell noble lords that the two countries which totally oppose us are spain and portugal <e>", "<cs> my lords british rail is preparing plans for new rolling stock and signalling equipment for the waterloo and city line <e> <s> we hope to have its proposals later this year <e> <s> i am sure this investment will significantly improve the quality of service for rail passengers <e>", "<cs> my lords i assure the noble lord that as your lordships will be aware the government have been doing all they can to promote liberalisation on european flights <e> <s> the reason why the civil aviation authority has to consider these applications is that objections have been made to some of them <e> <s> that is why a hearing is to be held in march <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> on some of the routes british caledonian has objected to air europes applications and vice versa <e> <s> both airlines have asked for a hearing <e> <s> other airlines have also objected and wish to be heard <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the other airlines are british airways and dan air not necessarily in respect of all the routes but some of them <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the sale of british airways is concerned british airways has always made clear that it would be much happier with a more competitive environment and would welcome any moves which make it less dependent on the requirements of competing carriers <e> <s> as i said in answer to the noble lord lord kissin we continue to press in europe for a europe-wide agreement and we shall of course continue to do so under the belgian presidency <e> <s> we should of course like to see more bilateral agreements but it must be remembered that we already have several with the more liberal states and it is unlikely at the moment that we shall be able to achieve them with other states <e>", "<cs> my lords there is nothing this government can do about ratification <e> <s> as i said in my original answer it is the subject of a court case in ireland at the moment <e> <s> the single european act will not come into force until all states have ratified the act <e> <s> i cannot say how long it will be before the irish court case is over <e> <s> as regards the proposals put before the transport committee the present arrangements will obviously continue <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise <e> <s> it is th march next <e>", "<cs> my lords this question specifically relates to aviation matters before the transport council and i have answered it as regards the single european act <e>", "<cs> my lords we are talking about the general competition proposals which are before the european economic community transport council <e> <s> as regards the other matters raised by the noble lord if they came before the transport council my understanding is that when the single european act is ratified by all states they would be subject to qualified majority voting <e> <s> that is my understanding of the position <e>", "<cs> my lords under the present arrangements we have been trying very hard to achieve liberalisation in european aviation <e> <s> as regards whether we can deal with the matter in our own courts i suspect that the answer is no because unless one wishes to fly wholly within this country another country becomes involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much hope so provided of course that the commission and the belgian presidency stand firm and put an acceptable package of measures before the council <e>", "<cs> my lords that does not affect the question <e> <s> the government of ireland have already agreed to the single european act <e> <s> that will not be affected by the result of the election and it is at present a matter before the irish courts <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness studies the answer i gave she will see that i covered her point about whether the council of transport ministers co-operate in this matter <e> <s> the commission is acting under its own autonomous powers conferred by article of the treaty <e> <s> this is because the council has so far failed to adopt an aviation competition regulation under article of the treaty <e> <s> such a regulation forms part of the package of measures now under discussion <e> <s> when an article regulation has been adopted the commission will act in accordance with it and thus under guidelines from the council <e> <s> this is the normal procedure in most other areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i have attempted to explain how the commission and the transport council operate together or separately <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord cares to read the reply i have already given he will find the answer to that <e> <s> as regards the answers from the airlines this as i have explained is a matter between the commission and the airlines <e> <s> in broad terms i understand that the letters said that aspects of the relative inter-airline agreements were incompatible with article <e> <s> most airlines asked for the original two-month deadline to be extended and the commission agreed to do this <e> <s> however even now a number of airlines have apparently not provided substantive replies <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of the interest of the noble baroness in this matter <e> <s> i have at all stages attempted to give full and complete <e>", "<cs> i think my lords that the noble baroness strays somewhat from the question on the order paper <e> <s> under the present electoral system there is no reason why the noble baroness lady burton should not be elected <e>", "<cs> my lords the only matter of concern to the commission as regards british caledonian was the arrangement on one particular route which it operated jointly with alitalia <e> <s> it satisfied the commission as to the arrangements on that route and therefore it is in the clear so to speak <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i have already said that that is a matter for the commission but i can assure my noble friend and the house that british airways is having full and useful discussions with the commission <e>", "<cs> my lords on the contrary my right honourable friend naturally pays close attention to the observations made by both mr tugendhat and his predecessor as chairman of the caa <e> <s> if the caa considers that additional airport capacity is needed then the authority will formally so recommend to my right honourable friend as it is required to do so under section of the civil aviation act <e> <s> my right honourable friend has not yet received any such recommendation from the caa but if he does then he will of course give it most careful consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have details of the figures which the noble baroness gives me as to whether gatwick is the busiest airport with a single runway <e> <s> but in the white paper the government re-affirmed that a second main runway should not be built and the key reason for that was environmental <e>", "<cs> my lords in my original answer i said until at least <e> <s> however as i said in my second answer to the noble baroness if the caa considers that additional airport capacity is needed then it has the powers to recommend that to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already stated the governments position as regards the second runway at gatwick <e> <s> so far as heathrow is concerned there have been improvements over recent years due to the fact that aircraft are now quieter than they used to be <e> <s> the review of night restrictions on flying is still going on at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble frend is quite right <e> <s> of course the question refers to the south-east of england but during the last few years there has been a very large increase in the usage of airports in the north of england and particularly manchester when not on strike <e> <s> certainly it has been a great success story <e>", "<cs> my lords in the report which was produced in the white paper of it was recommended by the inspector that the second runway at gatwick should not be built and the government stand by that decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i disagree with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords if i gave that impression i certainly did not mean to <e> <s> i said that there was a strike at manchester airport <e> <s> i attributed no blame to one side or the other as to who was responsible for it <e> <s> but it is unfortunately hampering the development of what is a very successful airport indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord was quite right when he said that the first phase at stansted will be restricted to no more than million passengers per year and that this will be done by means of an air transport movement limit imposed by order on affirmative resolution <e> <s> any further increase to say million in the second phase will also be subject to parliamentary approval <e> <s> so i think there is plenty of opportunity for those concerned to make their feelings felt <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> that is not what i said <e> <s> i was answering the noble baroness specifically on the question of a second runway at gatwick when i said that environmental considerations had ruled that out <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i will write to the noble baroness <e> <s> we shall just have to wait and see what <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft merchant shipping prevention and control of pollution order laid before the house on th january be approved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his general welcome to the order <e> <s> to turn to reporting the noble lord asked particularly about our near european neighbours <e> <s> of course we operate very closely with them under a number of conventions <e> <s> the mechanism will be the same for this reporting as it is at present for the reporting of oil discharges <e> <s> this extends the mechanism at present in force for oil discharges to cover the requirements for other particular types of chemicals <e> <s> the report is made to the nearest coastal state by the fastest means possible <e> <s> these guidelines will be developed by means of an m notice <e> <s> it is really an extension to the existing arrangements <e>", "<cs> i think that it would have been better if i had not interjected but had waited to reply at the end of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord campbell of croy for initiating a debate on this important topic <e> <s> he is well known for his interest in matters related to disabled people as indeed is your lordships house <e> <s> that has been amply demonstrated this afternoon <e> <s> the subject is of great importance to many people and i believe it is right that your lordships should formally consider it <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly see whether there is any further information <e> <s> as i said there have been a few sample analyses in various local authorities and if i can obtain more information i shall certainly write to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house of course noble lords have every right to do that if that is what they wish when we come to the various amendments <e> <s> the groupings were agreed <e>", "<cs> my lords i said when i explained amendment no <e> <s> to your lordships that it had not been easy to make it any clearer <e> <s> but we have gone a great distance in making it considerably clearer as we said at committee we would do <e> <s> therefore i have fulfilled that wish of the committee and i am grateful to the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale for having said those kind words about the number of occasions on which i have met views expressed in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will deal with it briefly <e> <s> i had hoped that <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord swinfen as he said moved identical amendments at the committee stage and at that time i gave my reasons for not accepting them <e> <s> therefore i shall be as brief as i can now in i am afraid giving the same reasons <e> <s> incidentally we had originally suggested that amendments nos <e> <s> and should be grouped together with these amendments but that suggestion was rejected by noble lords opposite and we bowed to their wishes <e> <s> so there is co-operation and i am very happy to answer now the points made in connection with amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> not at all my lords <e> <s> i said that obviously most of the existing pilots if not nearly all of them will continue working in the same places as they are now and they will not need to have any special qualifications <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i could not give the assurance which the noble lord seeks as i thought i had explained in answer to the amendment <e> <s> i also pointed out one considerable difficulty to which the amendment gives rise <e> <s> i think that we shall have to take the opinion of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords that is exactly the sort of thing at which i imagine the arbitration will look <e> <s> the arbitration process is for the transition of pilots from the present arrangements into future arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i was hoping to deal with the matter more fully when we reach the arbitration clause <e> <s> the pilots and ports are already talking to us about what will be within the purview of the arbitration procedures <e> <s> i cannot give a cast-iron guarantee that this will be included but i very much expect that it will be <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the arbitration clause deals specifically with the terms of any provision of any contract of employment to be entered into between the parties that is the pilot and the port <e> <s> as authorisation is the equivalent of employment or self-employment and it would be covered by that <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise <e> <s> i was meant to be speaking to amendment no <e> <s> also which is purely a drafting amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the noble lord lord kirkhill on having come back again at this second stage of the bill <e> <s> admittedly he has moved from one year to two however i fear i have to tell your lordships that even with that i shall not be any friendlier towards the amendments than i was at committee stage <e> <s> nonetheless i shall attempt to be brief <e>", "<cs> subsection of clause is aimed at ensuring as far as possible that existing licensed pilots shall be given every opportunity to continue in their profession under the new regime <e> <s> i think that that will be welcomed in all quarters of the house <e> <s> however i should like to give two reasons why we do not accept that the two-year period would allow sufficient time first for harbour authorities to decide on the number of pilots they will eventually need once the initial wrinkles in the pilotage service they wish to provide have been smoothed out and secondly to allow a reasonable period of time for those who wish to carry on in pilotage to find a new berth <e> <s> we hope there will be cases of ports where there is no surplus of pilots and where volunteers will be prepared to take early retirement so creating vacancies for surplus pilots from elsewhere <e> <s> all this takes time and i cannot accept that the first amendment will give everyone long enough <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the noble lord himself said that the bill has significance possibly in the clyde and the forth and that so far as i am concerned is pretty remote from here <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord will give way for a moment <e> <s> we have just passed amendment no <e> <s> in my name which struck out subsections to <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say first to the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale that the new clause of amendment no <e> <s> has been tabled for a week and indeed the noble lord lord underhill put down some amendments to it <e> <s> i cannot accept therefore that people have not had an opportunity to look carefully at it <e>", "<cs> my lords we have not yet come to that point <e> <s> we shall reach it when we deal with amendment no <e> <s> among other measures on arbitration <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may say that is does indeed make things abundantly clear but unfortunately it makes them clear beyond what we think they should be <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house my noble friend has completely misinterpreted what i said about the guidelines for the arbitration procedure <e> <s> i shall repeat the phrase which he will be able to read tomorrow in <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord underhill has explained the amendment would deprive a cha of the power to suspend or revoke an authorisation other than on grounds of incompetence or misconduct <e> <s> i am not yet persuaded that the powers to remove an authorsation on the grounds specified in paragraphs b and c can reasonably be dispensed with <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments propose that the bill should deal for employment protection purposes with the previous service of pilots to be employed by chas in the same way as it deals with the previous service of the employees of pilotage authorities <e> <s> the difference is of course that the pilots previous service is as self-employed pilots and there has been absolutely no exception to the principle that such self-employed service should not count towards a period of service for the purposes of rights under the employment protection legislation <e> <s> i do not believe that it would be right to make an exception in this case <e> <s> that legislation is about employment and employees and i hope that noble lords will agree that it would be quite wrong to extend its provisions to periods of self-employed service <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give an example offhand of any other case to which this might apply <e> <s> of course it might set a future precedent which would be undesirable as well <e> <s> but i think that the alternative that i have offered is a fair one <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i would say that associated british ports while not a member of the bpa are participants in these discussions and they will of course be part of the national guidelines to which i referred <e> <s> the noble lord obviously does not feel that what i have said is fair but what i said was that these national guidelines would be taken into account by the arbitration panel <e> <s> therefore if a port outside tried to go against them they would almost certainly lose when they went before the arbitrators <e>", "<cs> my lords it is for the reasons that i have already given in my original reply <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a similar amendment to the one that the house has just decided upon <e> <s> indeed it is identical to an amendment my noble friend moved in committee <e> <s> whether it satisfies my noble friend or not this amendment would give the pilots an entitlement to compensation over and above the employment protection provisions to which they will be entitled by virtue of their contracts of employment or other contractual arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall pick up a couple of points <e> <s> i am <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had an interesting little debate on the amendment which i think is sensible <e> <s> i am glad to say that i think it is unnecessary since it is already made clear under section of the local government act which regulates the membership and proceedings of local authority committees that committee member shall not take part in proceedings that affect them personally <e> <s> that section will continue to apply notwithstanding any of the provisions in the bill <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has not studied the bill with the care that i hoped he had and <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord mottistone makes an interesting point <e> <s> i thought i had already answered amendment no <e> <s> in the name of the noble lord lord underhill when i spoke to amendment no <e> <s> and i also thought that the noble lord had already spoken to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> may i try to clarify the mind of the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale <e> <s> i feel nervous about trying to do so because if a legal brain such as his cannot understand the point then i feel rather doubtful whether i shall be able to explain it to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am paraphrasing the subsection which is perhaps a mistake when replying to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> subsection of the new clause is really very little different from what used to be in the old clause except that we refer to a contract for services <e> <s> it is primarily the competent harbour authority that decides whether it wishes to employ pilots or to make other arrangements under a contract either self-employment or through an agency <e> <s> that is the best i can do to explain the position to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i do not know whether he is any clearer about it now <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be helpful to the house if i tried to set out the intention behind the new clause in this amendment <e> <s> subsection will allow a cha to make what arrangements it considers appropriate for the provision of pilotage services <e> <s> in principle they will be able to choose between self-employment and employment <e> <s> it will not be open to the pilots to make this choice <e> <s> subsection says that there is no obligation on the cha to authorise anyone if he is not prepared to accept such arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall attempt to answer the points as best i can <e> <s> i would pick up the noble lord lord underhill on one matter <e> <s> this new clause amendment no <e> <s> has been down for a week and the noble lord has put down amendments to it so he did of course have the opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords that is true <e> <s> if the noble lord would cast his mind back to about midday today we suggested that his amendments be grouped in an earlier group because then they would not have fallen <e> <s> perhaps they would have fallen but at least we could have had a discussion on them <e>", "<cs> my lords i know i am right about it <e> <s> whether i am expressing it in the correct way is for the noble and learned lord to decide <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> that is one of the amendments of my noble friend lord strathcona which is an amendment to this amendment <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords to answer the noble lord lord shackleton i must say that i am not attracted to the idea of recommitting this new clause <e> <s> the new clause has been produced in response to a specific undertaking given at committee stage to your lordships <e> <s> i feel it is well within the bounds of behaviour of your lordships house that i should bring forward an amendment at this stage <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> we are on report <e> <s> i will not give way i am sorry <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> i will not give way i should like to get on with the business <e> <s> we are going slowly enough as it is <e> <s> i know this is an important matter but we are at an important stage <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether they have agreed but we are talking to representatives of <e>", "<cs> very well in his own words i did not hear him myself namely that pay in future should be linked to the profits of undertakings and i quite agree with him <e> <s> pilots earnings at present as my noble friend lord strathcona and mount royal will well know are set at the beginning of the year to take account of what they think the traffic will be into and out of a port in that year <e> <s> if the traffic in the year falls perhaps even to nothing the pilots will not earn anything at all <e> <s> therefore it is a complete myth to say that pilots earnings at present are guaranteed <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first apologise to the noble lord lord shackleton if he thought i was being particularly hasty or rude to him <e>", "<cs> my lords he knows the procedures of the house at report stage and he has in fact had the opportunity now that we are back to discussing the new clause to make his point so that at least is something <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord swinfen the noble lord lord greenway and other noble lords are quite right to be concerned about the state of pilot boats <e> <s> by saying that i do not mean to imply that the present state of pilot boats is bad i am talking about future standards <e> <s> i can only reaffirm what i said during the debate on these amendments in committee <e> <s> the safety and manning of pilot boats are important issues <e> <s> as my noble friend lord swinfen is aware the department has circulated to interested parties a draft merchant shipping notice which provides that the manning of each pilot boat will be determined by my departments district surveyors after consulting the pilotage authority concerned <e> <s> in future of course the chas will be consulted following the transfer of pilotage responsibilities to them <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall answer those two points <e> <s> what i said about the timing of this matter was that we should bring forward the regulations before the implementation of the bill <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i do not think that it is necessary to have an amendment to the merchant shipping act to allow us to make different regulations for different areas <e> <s> i am pretty sure that that is correct but if i am wrong i shall write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords we have been over this ground before in committee <e> <s> as i understand the intention behind the amendments it is that a cha would need to obtain a harbour revision order to reduce the present area of compulsory pilotage or to extend it beyond the limits of the former pilotage district <e> <s> i am not sure that the amendments achieve that objective <e> <s> i drew noble lords attention when the same amendments were discussed in committee to an <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord shackleton and i reaffirm my apology to him <e> <s> however i am bound to say that i do not propose to accept this amendment and i therefore hope that the question of recommitment will not arise <e> <s> i am a yachtsman but i doubt whether there would be room for a pilot on board my boat in addition to my crew <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord underhill has explained his amendments <e> <s> they are as he said similar to amendments that were put down at committee stage <e> <s> pilotage is one aspect of the controls which need to be exercised in harbours and their approaches to ensure the safe movement of shipping <e> <s> the bill recognises this by placing pilotage under the same authorities as these other controls <e> <s> as i pointed out in committee when making directions about the movement of shipping in their ports most port authorities are not under any formal obligation to consult anyone other than shipowners who are the people who may be financially affected by such decisions and whose ships are directly at risk if the harbour authority makes the wrong decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i think for once we are all in agreement on an amendment although i am not quite sure that our reasons for agreeing are exactly the same <e> <s> i accept that masters of ships using a harbour should be made aware that a pilotage direction has been made by the local harbour authority particularly in view of the offence provisions in the bill for failing to comply with a pilotage direction <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i do not think that that is the case <e> <s> the only people who can make representations i think i am right and i shall check on this are the shipowners as detailed elsewhere in this clause <e> <s> i shall look into that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that this time i can only reinforce the comments that i made during debate at committee on a similar amendment which my noble friend put down <e> <s> while i agree this amendment is more limited in that it restricts the right to appeal to those parties which the chas are required to consult under clause i am still not convinced that an appeal to the secretary of state on decisions which depend on local circumstances is appropriate <e> <s> the chas will have to consult port users before making a pilotage direction and that will give the opportunity for them to make representations <e> <s> in the nature of things a cha will be bound to give careful consideration to the views of its customers <e> <s> otherwise it could be in danger of losing those customers <e> <s> but i consider that to give my right honourable friend the secretary of state a power to override the decisions of the chas in this area would represent a substantial derogation from the responsibility of the chas for decisions on pilotage needs in their harbours which as i can only reaffirm it is the intention of this bill to place fairly and squarely on their shoulders <e> <s> therefore i am afraid that i cannot be as friendly as i have been to my noble friends previous amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords clause requires those chas which adopt rgimes of compulsory pilotage to issue pilotage exemption certificates to any person who can meet the required standards <e> <s> i said during the debate in committee that the only grounds on which we think a cha should be entitled to refuse to issue a certificate are those relating to an individuals competence experience and local knowledge <e> <s> i reaffirm that this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for having moved this <e>", "<cs> my lords when we discussed this matter in committee i mentioned the reasons why in the short term chas should have the option of requiring a contribution from certificate holders <e> <s> some mariners particularly those operating in ports where there have previously been restrictions on the issue of certificates will be among the most direct beneficiaries of pilotage reorganisation and can reasonably be required to pay towards the costs associated with that reorganisation <e> <s> i am glad that my noble friend has recognised this in tabling his amendment <e> <s> but as i also explained in committee whatever the short-term position i believe there is also a case for allowing a cha the option of making such charges in the long term to help meet the costs of the pilotage service in the port <e>", "<cs> my lords before noble lords decide who is to move the amendment perhaps i may mention that in principle i am prepared to accept it except that i feel there is a printing error in it <e> <s> i think that noble lords are referring to section rather than section <e> <s> i pointed that out to the noble lord lord underhill earlier but i am afraid that it has not been corrected on the marshalled list <e> <s> if the amendment refers to section i am prepared to accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened carefully to the debate on these amendments when they were brought forward in committee <e> <s> i have subsequently read the proceedings again several times <e> <s> i remain convinced that it would be wrong to accept them <e> <s> to do so would be likely to compel the secretary of state to impose an unnecessary burden on a number of harbour authorities <e> <s> in particular there are likely to be a number of authorities falling within the definition in clause where there is unlikely to be any practical problem about the future organisation of pilotage <e> <s> it is a central principle of the bill that decisons about what pilotage services are needed are local matters which should be decided locally by chas in the light of their experience <e> <s> to accept these amendments would involve the secretary of state in a number of decisions which should be made locally <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> work on the east coast main line between london and edinburgh is ahead of schedule at the moment <e> <s> there should be no problem in meeting our target of the london to leeds service in and the london to edinburgh service in <e> <s> full electric services to huntingdon and peterborough will start in may <e>", "<cs> my lords the chances of the trains stopping will be a great deal less when the electrification scheme has progressed further than was the case before <e>", "<cs> my lords no i would not agree with my noble friend as i shall attempt to explain later on this afternoon <e> <s> all proposals put forward by british rail must meet the investment criteria laid down and they are all judged on their merits <e>", "<cs> my lords in the past three years no proposals submitted to ministers have been turned down <e> <s> as regards schemes awaiting consideration there is the royston to cambridge section which has recently been received by my right honourable friend and he will be making a decision on that as soon as possible <e> <s> i believe that that scheme is the only one at present before us <e>", "<cs> my lords that is mainly a matter for british rail <e> <s> there are a considerable number of projects in train at the moment and as i have said the east coast main line project will be carrying on until <e> <s> however british rail may put forward other proposals before that date <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that a proposal for that line has been put forward <e> <s> however i shall certainly look into that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords that question is very far wide of the question on the order paper and no doubt it is one which will be raised later on today <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards converting the southern region to overhead cable that would be a major project which would not only be extremely expensive but would also cause a good deal of inconvenience and difficulty while it was taking place <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords as i expected this has been a constructive and well-informed debate and i am much encouraged by the overall mood of support both for the project and for the bill though i fully accept that there are still reservations about matters of detail and indeed more general reservations from a few noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords it is only in the tunnel that people will not be allowed to smoke <e> <s> even those of us who smoke can probably manage minutes without a cigarette <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to make it clear that the considerations which i believe underlie the motion of the noble lord are some that the government believe to be of the greatest importance <e> <s> the government are convinced that the channel tunnel project is capable of bringing great benefit to all the regions in the united kingdom both while it is being constructed and when it is operating <e> <s> during the construction period orders for equipment and materials will need to be placed both by eurotunnel and by british rail totalling in the region of billion <e> <s> by far the greater part of this expenditure will take place outside the south-east mainly in the midlands the north and scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted that my noble friend has had a satisfactory repair done to the road outside her home <e> <s> lane rental has proved very successful with contracts being completed on average per cent <e> <s> more quickly than normally expected <e> <s> as a result days of delay were avoided in worth over million to the nation <e>", "<cs> my lords we have increased the public expenditure provision for local road maintenance by per cent <e> <s> for continuing a run of increases well above the rate of inflation <e> <s> decisions on spending priorities are of course a matter for local authorities <e> <s> but we hope very much that they will respond by increasing the money devoted to road maintenance <e> <s> as regards the horne report i am afraid that i do not have the information with me and i shall have to write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords that question is a little outside the one on the order paper <e> <s> also as the noble lord says your lordships committee will be reporting shortly <e> <s> i shall reserve my judgment until i see the report <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly since we have doubled the provision for repair on motorways particularly from miles per year in to miles per year now <e> <s> so our record is i think pretty good <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> bypasses are indeed one of the main priorities in the governments trunk road construction programme bringing as they do relief to residents from traffic noise and fumes and contributing to improved road safety <e> <s> in england for example over per cent <e> <s> of planned trunk road schemes are bypasses <e> <s> at the present time there are trunk road bypasses and relief roads under construction in england three in scotland and three in wales and a further schemes in england in scotland and in wales are in the forward programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that i do not recall the debate mentioned by the noble lord as it was three years ago <e> <s> however when the current <e>", "<cs> my lords in mentioning bypasses in the new forest i presume the noble lord is referring to the debate that will take place tomorrow <e> <s> that of course does not concern a national road it is a local road <e> <s> but in general terms we shall continue to be guided by those recommendations <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the noble lord specific details as i suspect that it depends on the planning process to a certain extent and on how much of an inquiry needs to take place <e> <s> but in general terms i think the time is too long <e>", "<cs> my lords i can certainly try and i shall do so <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as local bypasses are concerned we give every encouragement to local highway authorities to build new bypasses and relief roads <e> <s> that is a principal feature of the new capital only transport supplementary grant system <e> <s> for instance for this coming year we have announced support for bypasses or relief roads of which are in progress and are new starts <e>", "<cs> my lords i have details on the scheme for the a haltwhistle west of haydon bridge <e> <s> we intend to go to public consultation on the scheme as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> as the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale has explained the intention of these amendments is to remove any possibility that local by-laws will derogate from the operation of these clauses which concern these authorised pilots <e> <s> however i have to say that i believe that the references to by-laws are inappropriate since any by-laws made under the existing legislation and i imagine that we are here talking about section of the pilotage act will lapse when the bill comes into force and the bill contains no equivalent by-law-making powers <e> <s> the noble and learned lord did refer to that and that certainly is our opinion on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord greenway <e> <s> i agree that the case is being slightly overstated <e> <s> after all the amendment only refers to <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i moved the amendment a long time ago and we have had a debate on it <e> <s> however if that is not the case i shall move it again <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble and learned lords amendments to clause <e> <s> there is certainly a case for extending the provisions of this clause so as to cover anybody who is piloting whether or not he is an authorised pilot <e> <s> such people would include deep sea pilots and as my amendment no <e> <s> makes clear groups such as dock pilots and watermen <e> <s> it is hard to argue that such people should not be given information about the ship they are serving <e> <s> certainly i am prepared to accept the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot see what the noble lord is objecting to in this amendment <e> <s> the clause as redrafted will say that the provision applies up to the point to which the pilot has been engaged to pilot the ship <e> <s> if the pilot has been engaged to pilot the ship slightly beyond the area that will be an arrangement which is made beforehand <e> <s> it is reasonable to suppose that the ship will stop and let the pilot off at the point to which the pilot is engaged <e> <s> i cannot see that there is anything wrong with the amendment but i will have another look at it <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house obviously i cannot say not more than nine months but i hope it will be not much more than nine months <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave i have read this through and it did not look too bad to me <e> <s> on the point about its not being grammatical i cannot see much wrong with it myself <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to thank the noble lords lord <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i would not put it exactly in that way <e> <s> as the noble lord will he aware the property such as the boats which we are talking about would in ordinary circumstances pass to the successor authorities which are the chas <e> <s> in this amendment we are allowing them to make a settlement for cash instead if the present pilotage authority trinity house for instance wishes to hang on to them <e>", "<cs> my lords not without notice <e> <s> it is more likely to be a capital loss i should have thought <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to look at the point which the noble lord lord underhill has raised and write to him on the subject <e> <s> i shall certainly want to read what he said before i make any remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords this is familiar ground <e> <s> when my noble friend moved an amendment in the same terms in committee he explained that he thought there should in effect be some sort of appeal procedure where a cha was proposing to make major changes in local pilotage arrangements <e> <s> it was suggested that there should be an opportunity for other voices to be heard <e> <s> if i may say so i think that may noble friend rather overstates the case i am sure that any cha will be made well aware of the views of local interested parties and indeed any sensible authority will wish to make sure that that is the case <e> <s> as far as the most important consideration for port users is concerned that is the extent to which pilotage is to be compulsory there is a statutory obligation in clause to carry out consultations with users <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i have little to add to what i have said tonight and on a previous occasion <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that the commission is not an unimportant body <e> <s> it has been given a great many tasks to perform in the bill but i submit that that is not a task which should be added to those it already has <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i say that i am grateful to the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i explained in committee that i could see no case for a continuing statutory compensation scheme to be available for pilots once the period of reorganisation has passed <e> <s> i am glad to see that the noble lord lord underhill has accepted this at least to the extent of providing as his amendment seeks to do a means for such schemes to be withdrawn after a period of years <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that might be difficult <e> <s> what i spoke of with regard to the future of the pnpf was something extending into the future and not something which could be settled before the third reading <e> <s> it depends on the financial position of the fund going into the future <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments are prior to the operation of the arbitration procedure before the appointed day <e> <s> the first would mean that a dispute would have to be between a cha and the majority of those seeking authorisation before arbitration could be invoked <e> <s> this might rule out going to arbitration on a dispute concerning contract terms affecting only a few pilots and thus limit the application of the clause <e> <s> therefore i am not sure that it does not go a little further than we may wish <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said i spoke to this amendment when amendment no <e> <s> was moved and i gave a broad outline of what we thought would and would not be covered by the arbitration procedure <e> <s> at that time i think one meeting had taken place between the british ports association and the representatives of the pilots under the chairmanship of officials from my department <e> <s> i can say that fruitful discussions have taken place <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> will enable my right honourable friend the <e>", "<cs> yes certainly my lords <e> <s> i think that would be helpful because this is a complicated issue <e> <s> if the noble baroness would like to put down for written answer a question to that effect i shall be delighted to publish the letter i wrote to her on th february <e>", "<cs> my lords at the informal meeting of transport ministers on th february the commission made it clear that they would not be a party to a sell-out <e> <s> they confirmed that they would withdraw the proposal for exemptions from the competition rules if the council looked likely to vote in favour of a first step which failed to amount to real progress <e> <s> the government look to the commission to ensure that european consumers are not let down at this late stage in the negotiations <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that is correct <e> <s> i understand that the government are ready and willing to ratify the act as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to notify the house that his royal highness the prince of wales having been informed of the purport of the pilotage bill has consented to place his interest as duke of cornwall so far as it is affected by the bill at the disposal of parliament for the purposes of the bill <e> <s> i beg to move that the bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot accept the amendment as drafted but i accept the principle of it for which my noble friend has made a good case <e> <s> as he said it would not cost a cha much <e> <s> i fear that there are certain defects in the drafting but i give my noble friend an undertaking that the government will introduce an amendment along these lines in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that this subsection has caused some confusion to your lordships <e> <s> we have had considerable debate in committee and on report on amendments concern-ing it <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> put forward by the noble lord lord underhill would remove the subsection altogether <e> <s> i appreciate that there has been some concern that the subsection would have the effect of undermining the earlier provisions in the clause in particular those relating to the pilots right to be offered employment <e>", "<cs> i meant employment <e> <s> as i explained on report on the amendment which transferred this subsection to a new clause the intention of subsection is simply to make clear that whatever arrangements have been decided upon for a chas area a cha is under no obligation to authorise any person who is not willing to serve as a pilot under those arrangements whether they involve employment by the cha self-employment or arrangements with an agent <e> <s> what those arrangements are will of course be subject to the provision in subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords let me re-assure my noble friend lord strathcona and mount royal that i do not think that this matter could possibly affect the arbitration clause in any way <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> provided that the majority of pilots opt for employment it will be an obligation upon the cha to offer that <e>", "<cs> my lords that option has never been open <e> <s> the original offer has always been made by the cha however this bill has been drafted <e> <s> the first choice is with the cha <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house regardless of the amendments that we have moved this evening the situation is that the first choice is with the cha as to whether it wishes to offer employment or self-employment <e> <s> if the cha opts for employment that is it <e> <s> if the cha offers self-employment it is then up to the pilots to decide whether they wish to take up that self-employment <e> <s> if the pilots decide not to do so the cha is under an obligation to offer to employ them <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that to us there appears to be very little distinction between modified and altered <e> <s> of course i have taken advice on this matter and i am advised that this amendment would have no practical effect whatever <e> <s> it certainly would not give the dire consequences to which the noble lord lord carmichael referred <e> <s> personally i am very happy with the way in which the bill is drafted at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i was accused at report stage of bringing forward what might have been considered a wrecking amendment on another subject and i am bound to say that it seems to me that the noble lords amendment comes close to being that in relation to the arbitration clause <e> <s> it seeks to bind the arbitrators so that in any determinations they would be required to direct that contracts included three of the provisions which the noble lord has been seeking in amendments at earlier stages and which for very good reasons i have not been able to accept <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is misrepresenting me completely <e> <s> i said things which had been agreed already <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure we are all agreed on the importance of the safety of pilot boats <e> <s> we have been over this ground on several occasions and on report i confirmed the undertaking given in committee to bring forward proposals on the regulations regarding the survey of pilot boats before the implementation of this bill <e> <s> i can confirm that that remains our intention <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i fear that it may take a little longer than that <e> <s> i have said that i hope to bring forward proposals for the regulations before the implementation of the bill <e> <s> i cannot go further than that <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall never get tired of that <e> <s> i wish that some of my noble friends would say it more often <e>", "<cs> my lords the only reason that it has occurred is that we refer to them as ships throughout the rest of the bill <e> <s> it is obviously easier to make one amendment to turn one reference to vessels into ships than to make many more amendments to turn all the references to ships into vessels <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not claim to be a great expert on english grammar either but at least i have the benefit of parliamentary counsel to give me advice on these matters <e> <s> i have indeed raised the points about which the noble lord spoke to me on the telephone and i can give him an assurance that the subsection as drafted does as it is intended to do require the secretary of state to consider representations from all those including representa-tives of staff and former staff whom the pilotage commission has had to consult about the schemes <e> <s> the words so representative refer back to the words representative of the staff or former staff in line on page <e> <s> i hope i have given the noble lord the assurance for which he is looking <e>", "<cs> my lords we had an interesting debate at report stage when i introduced what is now subsection c of this clause <e> <s> i said that it was a middle way between the rather conflicting interests of the district and the deep sea pilots <e> <s> the clause represents a compromise <e> <s> it commended itself to the majority of noble lords who spoke at report stage including the noble viscount lord simon and it appeared to be the best available option <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords briefly i thank all noble lords who have been kind enough to pay tribute to the way this bill has gone through the house <e> <s> i say to the noble lords lord greenway and lord shackleton that had i known that there were to be over amendments i do not think that i should have attempted to tackle this bill on my own <e> <s> i did not know that at the beginning <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their reception of the statement <e> <s> i should like to endorse what they have said particularly with regard to the prompt action by the belgian and other authorities and about the efficient way in which the rescue was co-ordinated <e> <s> i should also like to offer a tribute to the action taken from this side of the channel as well <e>", "<cs> my lords consideration will be given to that however there are great practical difficulties in compiling an accurate passenger list for this type of travel <e> <s> i believe that as many as people can arrive at a ferry port from a train at one time <e> <s> probably all of them have through tickets and it would cause great practical difficulties to compile an accurate passenger list <e> <s> of course the numbers of passengers carried must be compiled accurately <e> <s> however that will be something to be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that that is the case <e> <s> the parent company of townsend thorensen is p which is one of the worlds leading shipping operators <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already spoken about the problems as regards the fundamental design of the ferry <e> <s> it is well known in marine circles that there can be a stability problem with high-rise ferries if sea water enters the vehicle decks <e> <s> however both construction standards and operating procedures are designed to ensure that that does not happen <e> <s> the public inquiry will no doubt address design and safety margins for this type of ship <e> <s> for the present there is no evidence to suggest any reason to impose restrictions on their operation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i thank him very much <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in the statement it is against regulations for ferries to travel on the open sea with doors open <e> <s> i certainly would not recommend anybody to try it <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said there are practical difficulties <e> <s> we are talking about very large numbers of people travelling on these ships <e> <s> it is almost like travelling on a train <e> <s> there is no requirement to leave names and addresses before going on a train <e> <s> but it is a matter which will have to be looked into <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the government have given an assurance that they will do everything possible to ensure that when the tunnel opens the level of service at the ports and the tunnel alike will be the best practical within the resources available and that in judging the resources to be allocated to each mode the frontier control departments will do everything possible to avoid bias in favour of one competitor or the other <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is right and i have no doubt that we shall return to the issues of safety and rabies when the bill comes before your lordships committee <e> <s> however the question is specifically targeted at the terminals rather than the tunnel system itself <e>", "<cs> my lords at the informal council on th february the commission made it clear to other member states that it will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that any agreement on a package constitutes a genuinely worthwhile first step <e> <s> the commissions role in the negotiations is crucial <e> <s> we are encouraged by the line it is taking and trust that it will not cave in to restrictionist member states <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i understand that the consumer movement is in regular contact with <e>", "<cs> my lords the figure i gave in the first part of my answer was billion ecu and that concerned agricultural expenditure <e> <s> there is also a deficit of some million ecu carried forward from <e> <s> that i think is the figure to which the noble lord lord bruce of donington referred <e> <s> we are firmly of the view that the prospective deficit in must be contained within the resources available within the per cent <e> <s> vat ceiling and overall spending levels must be controlled accordingly <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give a figure for that of course but the budget council reached agreement by a qualified majority on the draft budget for on th february <e> <s> the united kingdom opposed proposals since they included the negative reserves which would add to the pressures on expenditure as regards the per cent <e> <s> vat ceiling <e>", "<cs> my lords it is of course an offence to ride a motor cycle without a provisional licence or after it has run out after the first two years <e> <s> it is not known how many licence holders use their motor cycle entitlement to ride a motor cycle on the road <e> <s> i believe that many people apply for a provisional licence and possibly never use it as they go directly to driving a car <e> <s> we are conducting a review at the present time of motor cycle safety and the effects of the transport act <e> <s> there is also a discussion paper entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that <e> <s> that is one of the reasons that we are having a review <e> <s> it is an offence to ride a motor cycle without a provisional licence just as it is an offence to drive a car without a licence <e> <s> anyone who is caught will be subject to the usual sanctions <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have to hand the figures for fatalities and injuries involving motor cyclists <e> <s> as the noble lord will be aware they are published regularly by my department <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that the last figures showed a slight decrease <e> <s> however there is no doubt that they are still <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> that was one of the points of the changes that were made <e> <s> if the test is not passed within two years that licence lapses and another licence cannot be obtained for another year after that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the situation is the same as the situation with a motor car <e> <s> one can get a provisional licence on application and then drive with l plates <e> <s> in the case of a motor cycle the licence is valid for only two years <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree <e> <s> it is a different situation <e>", "<cs> my lords that is indeed one of the proposals being considered in the review <e>", "<cs> my lords there are over approved off-road sites throughout the country on which appointed motor cycle training bodies can provide training and conduct part of the motor cycle <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already said in answer to the previous question that the compulsory training of novice riders is being considered within the review <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot tell my noble friend where all sites are situated but we are satisfied that the number and location of sites gives good coverage over the whole country <e> <s> as regards schools there are certain requirements for the off-road sites intended for part of the test but they are not especially difficult to comply with <e> <s> there is no particular requirement for other training sites <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to my noble friends second question i cannot give him a date <e> <s> if i can find any further information i shall certainly write to him <e> <s> we very much appreciate the efforts made by rospa and all other training organisations to train riders throughout the country <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been a small reduction in the number of motor cyclists taking training <e> <s> it is down from in to last year but that is probably a smaller reduction than the reduction in the number of motor cycles <e> <s> those figures i gave the noble lord during the previous question <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give any figures showing help which the government give to rospa at the moment <e> <s> i understand that the position is under review but i shall certainly bear in mind my noble friends remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords the cso is responsible for producing the figures <e> <s> the noble lords question refers to the change in the invisible figures which were the only ones which were altered <e> <s> they are based on the best information that it can assemble on each occasion <e> <s> the first estimate for any month is a projection only based on little firm evidence <e> <s> that is gradually improved over time as the many different pieces of information come in <e> <s> some do not come in for months or even years <e> <s> the noble lord referred to future predictions and the trade deficit <e> <s> i confirm that the red book figure is billion for this year <e> <s> however i point out that between and the current account deficit averaged per cent <e> <s> of gdp <e> <s> the projection is for a billion deficit for the coming year which is about per cent <e> <s> only of gdp <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is right <e> <s> as i said in my second answer the cso figures on invisibles are difficult to collect <e> <s> much of the information takes a long time to come in sometimes months or even years <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept the latter part of the accusation made by the noble lord lord diamond that the government are in difficulties <e> <s> they certainly are not <e> <s> that is proved by the cbi forecasts which came out this morning and which are the best forecasts for years <e> <s> as for what happened in was still at school and i do not know <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i am becoming somewhat surplus to this debate across the floor of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly draw the remarks of the noble lord to the attention of my right honourable friend <e> <s> however as i have said on an earlier occasion it is difficult to produce these estimates as the figures take a considerable length of time to come in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord underhill for his reception of the orders <e> <s> i take the point that the explanatory notes could have been expanded a little to make clearer what is being done <e> <s> i will draw that to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords it is essentially an internal norwegian matter but our officials meet regularly in multilateral fora which discuss such matters <e> <s> certainly we shall be discussing that kind of matter with the norwegians <e>", "<cs> my lords the final proposals have not yet been published <e> <s> we do not therefore know exactly what form they will take <e> <s> as for the council of transport ministers i am sure that the proposal will be a matter of discussion <e> <s> norway not being within the common market is not a party to that <e> <s> however the norwegians obviously feel that they have a reason to retain their shipping under their own flag and these proposals are aimed at that <e>", "<cs> my lords we already have a fairly similar kind of arrangement in the isle of man and dependent territories registers which keep ships under the british flag <e> <s> however as i say this is a matter for the norwegians <e> <s> there is a limit to the amount that we can interfere with what they wish to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot confirm that it is precisely the same because we do not yet know the final details of what the norwegians propose <e> <s> however i have said that it is very similar to the kind of arrangement we can offer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my officials are constantly in touch with the general council of british shipping <e> <s> however i have not heard its reaction to the proposal by the norwegians <e>", "<cs> my lords i must admit that i have not seen the report of th march <e> <s> i shall of course look at it now that the noble lord has proposed it to me <e> <s> i have said that we can offer a similar kind of arrangement through the isle of man and dependent territories registers <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know the answer until i have read the report in the newspapers <e> <s> however as i have said we have still not seen the final proposals of the norwegians <e> <s> as i have also said it is very much an internal matter for them <e> <s> we cannot tell them that they cannot do this <e>", "<cs> my lords the present requirement of norways register is that two-thirds of the crew should be norwegian <e> <s> one of the proposals is that the vessels could have all-foreign crews <e> <s> it would of course be up to the shipping lines to satisfy themselves that they could still operate safely with that change <e> <s> i do not think the proposal applies to the officers <e> <s> i think that they will still remain norwegian <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that impression could be taken from anything i said this afternoon <e> <s> it certainly is not the case <e>", "<cs> my lords let me first say how grateful i am to my noble friend lord hardinge of penshurst for the question he has asked about the a <e> <s> i also take the opportunity of thanking other noble lords for their contributions <e> <s> the noble lord lord carmichael and i have something in common in that i do not think that either of us has any local interest in the area though i must admit that i once had a great uncle and aunt living in dymchurch <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has asked four questions i suspect that he knows the answers to the first three <e> <s> as regards the success of these measures we very much hope that they will encourage ships to stay on the united kingdom register <e> <s> there are many reasons why shipping has left the register not only in this country but throughout nato countries to much the same extent <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly take that aspect very seriously indeed <e> <s> at the present time we are confident that there are sufficient uk ships to meet the needs of the united kingdoms armed forces but it is something obviously that we watch very closely <e>", "<cs> my lords i was indeed present at that conference or part of it and i am aware of the concern that was expressed <e> <s> that of course is one of the reasons why the government announced their proposals to give assistance among other things to the training of seafarers <e>", "<cs> my lords that is one of the matters to which the nato report drew attention and we are certainly very active in attempting to make progress in our discussions with various flagged-out countries in order to be able to get our uk-owned shipping back in those circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no figures available at the moment but i shall certainly attempt to find some and let my noble friend have them <e> <s> however it is of course a fact that the soviet merchant navy has grown considerably over recent years <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord refers to the standing orders he will see that only one question is meant to be asked at a time <e>", "<cs> my lords that is something which is referred to in the nato report <e> <s> it would need a certain amount of consideration concerning cost and crewing but it is under consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords there are many reasons why the number of ships in the british merchant navy has fallen as indeed has the number of ships in the merchant navies of most of the developed world <e> <s> this has mainly been due to flagging-out to obtain cheaper crew costs <e> <s> to attempt to subsidise to the extent that would be required to keep ships on the british register would be very expensive indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the figures for the total of british-owned ships under flags of convenience but of course there are quite a number <e> <s> there is also quite a number of ships which are re-registered for instance in the isle of man and so they are still available for defence purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords as i had no notice of this question i do not have the figures with me but i can certainly write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords there has at last been real progress on cheap fares <e> <s> other countries have now unanimously accepted our view that cheap off-peak fares should be available to everyone <e> <s> this is a major step forward improving the prospect of overall agreement by the commissions deadline of th june although a considerable amount of work still has to be done by then <e> <s> we are pleased that the belgian presidency has called a further meeting on th june in addition to that planned for th/th june <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed the government are well aware of the views of consumers and we have made it clear to other member states that we will not accept any package which is watered down to a point at which it fails to bring real benefits <e> <s> it is important to remember however that we are here talking about a first step towards full liberalisation in <e> <s> considerable work still has to be done on a satisfactory package but agreement has already been reached on a new international arbitration procedure to which the noble baroness referred which will we hope make it easier for airlines to introduce new and cheaper normal fares if they want to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords that is precisely what the government have been trying to do for many months if not longer within the european community <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend that no government within the community have tried to do more than our own to liberalise european air fares <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the noble baroness is quite correct that the fares deal is only part of an overall package and that considerable work still needs to be done particularly in the vital area of market access <e> <s> the commission has in effect set a deadline of th june for agreement in the council <e> <s> after that it will withdraw its offer of some exemptions from the competition rules <e> <s> we greatly welcome the increased pressure that this has brought to bear on the council and the robust attitude adopted by the commission in negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords chartered flights already enjoy a fairly liberal regime <e> <s> i am not quite sure whether or not fares in that market could come down <e> <s> that would depend on the market <e> <s> however any pressure on commercial flights would probably have some effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure whether i understood the question of the noble lord lord paget correctly <e> <s> however if he was suggesting that questions from the noble baroness lady burton helped us on our way to achieve this package he is indeed correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much hope that there would have to be no further discussions on this matter <e> <s> the commission announced as the noble baroness said that it will continue with legal action and adopt reasoned decisions against the three airlines that the noble baroness mentioned <e> <s> these will take effect next week thus forcing them to bring their inter-airline agreements into line with the treatys competition rules <e> <s> their final period of grace which was given was to allow the airlines concerned to enter voluntarily into discussions with the commission in the way that all the other airlines subject to the article action are now doing <e> <s> i hope that this will prove effective <e>", "<cs> my lords at the end of the transitional period in january there were over additional services registered so the fears of those who thought that there would be massive cuts were quite wrong <e> <s> as regards new competition particularly in the minibus sector there are several examples <e> <s> for instance in manchester following the introduction by a private company of a new minibus service with vehicles the established local operator was stimulated into responding with his own minibus service <e> <s> therefore there are clear signs of the success of competition <e>", "<cs> certainly my lords <e> <s> the figures that i gave in the original answer show that competition is working to promote new services which are there at the response of the customer <e> <s> therefore for the first time in many years the market is responding to the needs of the customer rather than to those of the bus operator <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his question <e> <s> i do not have specific information about minibus services in glasgow or edinburgh <e> <s> however i am aware that in glasgow there has been keen competition among the operators which has resulted after a certain amount of difficulty initially in an increased service all round <e>", "<cs> my lords whether or not i accept the noble lords invitation to go to lancashire it is a fact that local authorities have saved over million in subsidy since the deregulation of bus services <e> <s> it is for local authorities to decide how to spend their money <e> <s> if this has happened in the noble lords area it is a matter that should be taken up with the local authority <e> <s> it certainly has the money to spend <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot do so without notice <e> <s> i have already quoted the saving to local authorities in the form of subsidies <e> <s> however despite the savings we have increased the amounts made available for safety checks by per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no figures but in general terms the average fares are broadly unchanged <e> <s> as regards services there has been a considerable change round as markets adapt to take care of the needs of the customer <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only agree with my noble friend <e> <s> i am sure that the experience is shared in many other parts of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that it may seem anomalous for larger coaches and buses to be zero-rated while a local service operating with a vehicle carrying fewer than passengers such as mentioned by my noble friend must bear vat <e> <s> however vat does not lend itself to fine tuning and the present dividing line has the advantage of being simple and clear in its applications <e> <s> to replace it by some more sensitive definition of socially valuable services would i fear result in a far more bureaucratic system <e>", "<cs> no my lords not without notice <e>", "<cs> my lords i still think that there will be considerable net savings <e> <s> if the local authorities must spend more on the tendering proposals in the initial period they will have plenty of money to spend later <e> <s> regarding a report of progress so far your lordships will be aware that a preliminary report has been published and a copy was placed in the library a little while ago <e> <s> a further report following the ending of the transitional period is expected to be published in the summer <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> that is why we hope to be able to introduce legislation as soon as possible <e> <s> it is a very unsatisfactory state of affairs at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite correct <e> <s> i suspect that i have seen the letter <e> <s> the spanish government are also well aware of our concern <e>", "<cs> my lords we are in touch with the ec commission on our proposals but we have to be very careful that such legislation would be compatible with our obligations under the treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope it will be possible to bring forward a bill at the earliest opportunity <e> <s> but legislation of this nature would introduce novel constraints that demand most careful consideration if they are to be effective in practice <e>", "<cs> very easily my lords because all fishing vessels have to be registered and therefore we have an easy way of collecting from them <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have always said that there are arguments both in favour of and against joining the exchange rate mechanism <e> <s> we shall join only when we are satisfied that the balance clearly favours doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid the noble baroness will be disappointed if she expects something new from me this afternoon <e> <s> it is not possible to specify precisely what the factors are <e> <s> there are a number of them and they and their interaction need to be taken into account <e> <s> it would be wrong to commit the government <e> <s> circumstances change and i do not think that it would help conditions in the exchange market for me to be too specific <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that that depends on which way one wishes to see the pound going <e>", "<cs> my lords i answered that question when i said that we should join only when we were satisfied that the balance clearly favoured our doing so <e> <s> as regards the points made by m delors we shall of course participate fully in those discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if the noble lord thinks that my replies are silly <e> <s> if he expects me to make some great policy statement this afternoon i am afraid he is in for a disappointment <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the chancellor said nothing new <e> <s> the policy is unchanged <e> <s> the question of the united kingdoms participation in the exchange rate mechanism is kept under review and as i said there are arguments both in favour and against joining it <e>", "<cs> my lords since last october the commissioners have consulted on each application <e> <s> as well as consulting local people and depositing notices in local post offices they have also consulted the department of agriculture and fisheries for scotland the department of transport local authorities the crofters commission the national farmers union of scotland and crown tenants who may be affected <e> <s> i am sure that the points which my noble friend has made will be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is absolutely right <e> <s> this type of business is of immense value to the scottish economy with an expected production of tonnes this year going up to tonnes next year with values of million and million respectively <e> <s> in addition it provides direct jobs for over people <e> <s> that does not include jobs in the service industries such as processing and feedstuffs which are ancillary <e> <s> it is very important to the scottish economy <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures related to salmon farming <e>", "<cs> my lords since october applications have been received <e> <s> by th april applications had been approved or partly approved applications were unsuccessful and had been withdrawn <e> <s> i therefore think that the point which my noble friend has made is being taken into consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords the right to fish for salmon is a separate heritable right under scottish law <e> <s> the right of the crown as owner of the sea bed exists concurrently with the right to fish for salmon in the waters above <e> <s> i hope that that answers my noble friends point <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it would be appropriate for me to indicate the governments support for this bill <e> <s> the noble baroness lady burton has made a couple of points about its rather tortuous passage through another place <e> <s> of course that is not a matter that i can deal with this afternoon <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> modification of airline agreements will clearly be a useful step forward towards more genuine competition but will not remove the unnecessary regulatory restrictions imposed by some governments <e> <s> it therefore remains essential for consumers that we should if possible reach agreement at the council of ministers on a satisfactory package of liberalising measures <e> <s> we hope this will be possible in june regardless of the state of play of the commissions direct action with the airlines <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first point raised by the noble baroness the tribunal on which agreement has been reached in principle would be established by the governments and not by the airlines <e> <s> it cannot become effective within the community unless formal agreement on the package as a whole can be reached <e> <s> without wishing to speculate on the date of the general election should there be an election my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport will then decide who should represent the united kingdom <e> <s> in any event we shall make every effort to secure agreement in june <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has a bill along those lines which is currently before the house <e> <s> if the council reaches a satisfactory agreement by th june the deadline set by the commission then unilateral action by member states will no longer be legally possible <e> <s> if no agreement is reached the government already have the necessary powers in section of the european communities act to establish article machinery and have already undertaken to do so if necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is right <e>", "<cs> my lords there are some international routes serving some destinations from regional airports in the united kingdom <e> <s> only about destinations were served in <e> <s> i greatly welcome this major increase in travel opportunities for the public <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are already committed to ensuring that the regional airports can develop in order to meet local demand <e> <s> we do not place any regulatory obstacles in the way of tour operators who see a demand for charter flights to and from regional airports <e> <s> indeed there are already a large number of such flights direct from regional airports <e>", "<cs> my lords it is our policy to encourage development by improving capital expenditure and by improvement to local authority airports where they are financially justified <e> <s> large allocations have already been made <e> <s> some million has been made available since <e> <s> several important developments have taken place for instance the new terminal at birmingham the runway extension at leeds-bradford and work at newcastle which is due to be completed this month <e> <s> i believe that we are encouraging the use of regional airports <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is right <e> <s> for example if one takes manchester airport new routes including seven intercontinental ones have been introduced since <e> <s> i could give many examples <e> <s> birmingham is serving nine new destinations <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly draw the noble baronesss remarks about birmingham to the attention of my honourable friend mr spicer <e> <s> of course manchester is a gateway airport in the north <e> <s> i admit that birmingham is in the midlands but i shall certainly draw her remarks to my honourable friends attention <e>", "<cs> my lords the repair or maintenance of buildings listed or otherwise has always been liable to vat at the standard rate <e> <s> on st june alteration work previously liable at the zero rate became standard-rated but zero-rating was retained for approved alterations to listed buildings and scheduled monuments so as not to worsen their position in relation to vat <e> <s> this concession was widely welcomed by those concerned with the preservation of our national heritage <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to my noble friends last question is yes <e> <s> he asked me a number of other questions <e> <s> with regard to relief on alterations and whether it may be an incentive to make undesirable changes we do not believe that is so <e> <s> relief is available only for approved alterations <e> <s> planning authorities can always refuse listed building consent for work that would affect the character of a listed building or destroy important features <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are of course considering all the select committees recommendations and will publish their observations as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i should point out that while presumably everyone who has to pay vat on anything would like zero-rating we believe that zero-rating would be indiscriminate <e> <s> we give grants where help is most needed <e> <s> in england this year such help for historic buildings from central government will amount to over million <e> <s> local authorities also make grants from their resources but i do not have that figure <e>", "<cs> my lords the repair or maintenance of buildings listed or otherwise has always been liable to vat at the standard rate <e> <s> my noble friend will no doubt be aware that the government accept that they have no authority under the ec sixth directive to introduce any new zero rate or to restore one which has been given up <e>", "<cs> my lords the question refers to listed historic houses and i shall restrict my answers to that <e>", "<cs> my lords i have said that there are ways of giving grants other than exempting from vat <e> <s> that is what we seek to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have a figure for vat charged on repairs to listed historic houses <e> <s> i understand that there is no definition as such of a listed historic house <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the commons amendments be now considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this

say that i do not of course accept the contention that the bill needs to be recommitted to a select committee <e> <s> some noble lords suggest that it has received too little attention so far <e> <s> the bill introduced in another place in april received its second reading in june last year and was then committed to a select committee which received almost petitions and sat for days <e> <s> that committee gave the most careful consideration to the effects of the bill on private interests and published a thorough and impressive report to which the government responded in february this year <e> <s> the wider issues of public policy raised by the bill were subsequently considered in full at both committee and report stages in the other place <e>", "<cs> i find myself in agreement with the speech of the noble lord lord underhill <e>", "<cs> the point of the noble and learned lord lord scarman concerned the road infrastructure in kent <e> <s> we shall be coming in due course to amendments which affect that so i was not proposing to deal with it at the moment as it is not particularly relevant to this amendment <e>", "<cs> to answer the question put by the noble lord lord sefton i think eurotunnels proposal if this bill goes through in timely fashion to royal assent is that there will be a public issue of shares in the autumn <e> <s> the noble lord will have to wait until then before investing his money in the project if that is what he proposes to do <e>", "<cs> i have given one example already of the type of thing contained in the concession agreement <e> <s> the best solution is i think that i write to the noble lord lord carmichael putting a copy in the library and sending a copy also to the noble lord lord mulley <e> <s> i shall also see whether i can find other things of interest to the noble lords <e>", "<cs> i entirely sympathise with the motives of this amendment in that one of the great benefits of the fixed link will be the tremendous boost that the actual process of building it will give to production and jobs in this country <e> <s> as has been said on many occasions it will be a billion pound opportunity for british industry and that is not the total value of the project which is billion at prices not including british rails expenditure <e>", "<cs> that is a point which i am not in a position to answer at this precise moment so i may have to write to the noble lord about it <e>", "<cs> that is indeed true <e> <s> i shall almost certainly be able to cover the point later <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord peyton of yeovil for the interesting discussions about what happened to the old project and why it was cancelled <e> <s> i can only reaffirm once more that this governments determination and indeed absolute commitment is that there should be no public funding of the present project <e>", "<cs> i hope that i shall be able to persuade the noble lord lord mulley that the amendment is unnecessary by giving him the fairly technical explanation as to why that is so <e>", "<cs> as to the narrowing of the definition of enactment in line this would be unduly restrictive on the concessionaires <e> <s> i can say firmly that it is inconceivable that a power to provide funds to the concessionaires would be granted by means of subordinate legislation <e> <s> i certainly cannot accept that the effect of clause which i have already said i consider to be properly balanced should be restricted to future legislation <e>", "<cs> the objective of the new clause is entirely reasonable <e> <s> noble lords in committee have expressed that <e> <s> it seeks to ensure that the tunnel does not benefit competitively in relation to the ferries by having better customs and immigration facilities allocated to it than in fairness it should <e> <s> however i cannot support the amendment partly because on closer inspection it appears to go further than is intended and partly because the government feel that these are not matters that should be dealt with by legislative provision <e>", "<cs> the argument has been on two issues <e> <s> one question is whether there are enough customs officers <e> <s> the main point of the amendment is surely about even-handedness between the ports and the eurotunnel scheme <e> <s> i have tried to reassure the committee that there will be even-handedness in the allocation of customs officers between the two projects <e> <s> i shall obviously take into account what has also been said about the overall numbers of customs officers <e> <s> i cannot commit the government at this stage or six years hence about the total number of customs officers there might be <e> <s> however on the even-handed approach between the two schemes we should make sure that the allocation is obviously fair <e>", "<cs> yes certainly <e>", "<cs> the new clause proposed by the noble lord lord northbourne will apply to all providers of cross-channel transport and not just the concessionaires <e> <s> that is the difference between it and the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord carmichael <e>", "<cs> i did not say that i did not agree with the principle of the amendment that we should seek to avoid predatory pricing <e> <s> what i said was that i believed that we already have the mechanism to do this in both national and community law <e>", "<cs> i said that these things can happen quite quickly <e> <s> action can be taken quite quickly <e> <s> i also said that often the very fact of launching an investigation is sufficient to persuade the offender to stop the practice being complained of <e>", "<cs> the new clause in amendment no <e> <s> proposed by the noble lord lord ennals and supported by the noble lord lord tordoff requires the secretary of state to compensate the dover harbour board though the principle is equally applicable to the ferry operators for any loss of business resulting from competition from the fixed link if at any time eurotunnel is obliged in order to carry on trading to write off or reschedule any of its debts <e> <s> this proposal therefore accepts that if eurotunnel can fully pay its way it will have justified its place in the market and therefore the existing operators should accept any losses they incur as a result of such competition <e> <s> on the other hand it is argued that if events were to demonstrate that eurotunnel cannot fully pay its way that will show that it should not have been allowed to proceed with the project in the first place and therefore the government should pay compensation for any damage that eurotunnels entry to the market has inflicted on the existing operators <e>", "<cs> i do not think i can add very much more than i said in my original reply <e> <s> i can assure noble lords that when they read what i have said they will see that i did take into account amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am fully aware of the difference between this amendment and the latter two amendments <e> <s> i am not saying one way or the other whether eurotunnel is going to be a success i have said that on several occasions this evening <e> <s> i am not prepared to give investment advice on that issue nor would it be proper for me to do so <e> <s> it is a question for the market to decide <e> <s> i really have nothing further that i can say on this at the moment <e>", "<cs> both select committees made great efforts to examine the channel tunnel project from every conceivable point of view <e> <s> i am therefore disappointed that the noble lord lord tordoff should suggest another form of public inquiry <e> <s> i know that the way he moved the amendment does not square with the way that it reads because he is not suggesting that we should launch ourselves into a huge new public inquiry <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord decides what to do with the amendment i should say that i did not mention the committee which has been chaired by my honourable friend david mitchell with which the noble lord is no doubt familiar <e> <s> it has done a tremendous amount of work in kent <e> <s> there have been a tremendous number of public meetings since before the project was even chosen <e> <s> the joint consultative committee meets regularly in kent under my honourable friends chairmanship <e> <s> we have set up a complaints administrator and eurotunnel has a permanent information centre in folkstone <e> <s> of course large numbers of petitioners from kent have been heard by both select committees <e> <s> it is a continuing process <e> <s> the noble lord was right to ask whether it would continue <e> <s> i can tell him that it will <e>", "<cs> i am sure that there is <e> <s> i shall write to the noble lord i hope before monday <e>", "<cs> i was going to say to the noble lord lord underhill among others that this <e>", "<cs> i am having enough difficulties answering for the government let alone answering for the taxi drivers association <e> <s> the noble lord will have to ask them <e>", "<cs> the government have a great deal of sympathy with the aims of this amendment and so evidently does the committee on all sides <e> <s> it seems to me to be a matter of common sense that the efficiency attractiveness and therefore the profitability of the through rail services should not be compromised by what might so easily be portrayed as cautious or conservative attitudes on the part of our frontier control services the customs and immigration service not forgetting the ministry of agriculture <e>", "<cs> may i rise and make clear exactly what i did say to the noble lords lord tordoff and lord sefton <e> <s> the noble lord has misunderstood me and has not read the report of the select committee properly <e> <s> it was clear that the select committee appeared to be satisfied with the arrangements at waterloo but not with the on-train services beyond waterloo <e> <s> that was made clear <e> <s> the noble lord lord kennet <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should have said around waterloo <e>", "<cs> north of london is the safe phrase <e> <s> the noble lord lord harris has put his finger on it <e> <s> i am certainly prepared to reconsider the view which is obviously held throughout the committee that i should look again at the situation on trains going beyond london <e> <s> if the committee accepts the views of the select committee that probably nothing needs to be done on waterloo trains and i have already said that we have not yet finally made up our minds on that issue i will certainly look again at the situation with regard to trains beyond london <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has put his finger on the point <e> <s> the amendment is unacceptable because it is based on a misconception of the role of the safety authority <e> <s> it will not be the authoritys function to lay down <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may answer that point for the noble lord right now <e> <s> the safety authority is already established under an exchange of letters that took place when the treaty was signed in february of last year <e> <s> that exchange was incorporated in the printed version of the treaty which is command paper <e> <s> the safety authority is already beginning to look at the main issues <e> <s> of course it has no formal power yet such as under clause of this bill because the bill is not passed and the concession agreement that is signed is not in force until the treaty is ratified <e> <s> however it is already established and it is already beginning to look at this kind of thing <e>", "<cs> it is unfortunate that the noble lord lord sefton passed to me a copy of his amendment only a short time ago <e> <s> it is most unusual to have amendments put down in your lordships house with this kind of notice <e> <s> it is not a practice which is encouraged by your lordships house as <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for having brought this amendment before the committee <e> <s> i agree with him that it is an extremely important issue <e> <s> the safety authority has a crucial role to play <e> <s> we should perhaps remind ourselves of that role <e> <s> the authority is essentially a technical body established by the channel fixed link treaty to advise and assist the intergovernmental commission on all matters concerning safety and the construction and operation of the fixed link <e>", "<cs> we have had a good debate on this subject <e> <s> my noble friends lord morris and lord beloff have put their fingers on one grave difficulty with this amendment which is the question of the treaty which has already been signed <e> <s> the first paragraphs of clause state that <e>", "<cs> i can answer that question extremely easily <e> <s> this amendment goes beyond the recommendations of the select committee which acknowledged that there would have to be alternate french and british chairmen <e> <s> that is why the government response to the select committee did not refer to the difficulties which have been raised by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i cannot answer that point without assistance <e> <s> what i said was that the select committee recognised that there would have to be alternate chairmen between france and britain <e> <s> that was something which was recognised <e> <s> but this amendment goes beyond that <e> <s> i certainly do not suggest as the noble lord lord tordoff said that we were wasting the time of the committee <e> <s> that is just one point on it but i have also given a long explanation of why i think the present arrangements are fully satisfactory <e>", "<cs> i am sure we all agree that it would be desirable that disabled people should be able to take advantage of the tunnel system when it comes into being <e> <s> the noble baroness lady stedman widened the debate slightly to include segregation <e> <s> i spoke briefly on that subject and made the point that the safety authority is indeed looking at the question already <e> <s> the noble baroness rightly said that your lordships have always taken a special interest in disabled people <e> <s> so too i would claim does the department of transport because we have well at heart this cause of safe transport facilities for people with disabilities <e> <s> that is why this amendment has struck a sympathetic chord <e>", "<cs> i take the point but i have said that eurotunnel is working extremely hard on the matter at the moment <e> <s> during the assessment of the four rival fixed-link schemes the government received a number of representations from groups representing disabled travellers <e> <s> shortly after the decision was taken in january to award the concession to the promoters of the eurotunnel scheme the department of transport made contact with these groups to ensure that they had direct access to the designers of the tunnel system so that their needs could be met <e> <s> the government will continue to satisfy themselves that these essential interests are looked after but as i said my understanding is that they are receiving every consideration from eurotunnel <e>", "<cs> i am not enthusiastic about the amendment because as in all such cases it is not always possible to put in a bill indeed sometimes things can be made too difficult through being put in a bill exactly what everybody would like to see happen <e> <s> it may cause difficulties and involve one in litigation and so on <e> <s> i think that what is being done outside the bill is the better way <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly answer the noble lord lord mulley <e> <s> those are undertakings that have been given by eurotunnel <e> <s> it may be some years hence before the tunnel is built <e> <s> but as i have said previously these arrangements are being made right now and the shuttles are being designed now <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend lord campbell of alloway for pointing out one or two difficulties with this amendment <e> <s> another problem is that it may not be possible to carry people with all kinds of disability as is the case on many forms of transport at the moment <e> <s> if that were so it may be difficult to put into legal wording a binding obligation when best endeavours are appropriate <e> <s> that is the situation at the moment <e> <s> eurotunnel is making best endeavours <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness will feel that my observations are sufficient to reassure her <e>", "<cs> i shall not agree with the noble lord lord sefton about his faith in the public versus the private sectors but i do not think he would expect me to <e> <s> if he would care to read annex iii to the concession agreement which is cmnd <e> <s> this sets out the obligations of the concessionaires to take out certain kinds of insurance against the liabilities on the government <e>", "<cs> i am not certain that everyone might agree with my noble friend lord beloff <e> <s> but he is quite right that the main problem from rabies is due to people smuggling in pets <e> <s> that risk exists at present whether one comes by sea or by air <e> <s> i believe that small boats present the greatest danger as regards bringing in animals <e>", "<cs> i attempted to cover that point <e> <s> the important point is that the protection must be in place when the first connection is made and when the first tunnel is joined together <e>", "<cs> i find this new clause very unreasonable <e> <s> as the noble lord lord somers has said there is no connection between the sale of alcohol or tobacco within the tunnel system and i remind noble lords that the tunnel system is defined to include the terminals and everything else and the <e>", "<cs> whether or not the question of duty-free facilities arises with regard to the tunnel there are many years to go before the tunnel opens <e> <s> whether such duty-free facilities will then exist in europe one does not know <e> <s> however this amendment would go further and would not allow eurotunnel to sell alcohol or tobacco in the <e>", "<cs> this is in danger of becoming a debate between smokers and anti-smokers <e> <s> i must confess to the noble lord lord ennals that i am a smoker but i am probably among the one-third of those mentioned who would like to give it up <e> <s> i do not think that banning me from smoking within the whole of the tunnel system would help me very much to do that <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord underhill has explained his amendment very clearly <e> <s> i hope that i shall be able to answer the points that he has raised <e>", "<cs> the noble lord was kind enough to say that i was too young to remember the fire service in the war <e> <s> however my father served in the fire service throughout the war <e> <s> i do not know whether he was a colleague of the noble lord <e> <s> i appreciate his motives in moving the new clause <e> <s> it makes sense to ensure that safety equipment is compatible throughout the tunnel system and there should be a standard communication system for fire fighting teams whatever their nationality <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will accept my assurance that the new clause is unnecessary <e>", "<cs> i agree with everything that has been said about the importance of ensuring the highest standard of preparedness for any fire and rescue emergency in the tunnel system <e> <s> that means having the right numbers of men with the right skills and the right equipment standing by in the right places ready to respond promptly to whatever situations arise <e>", "<cs> i shall indeed <e>", "<cs> once again i shall seek to persuade the noble lord lord mulley that this clause is unnecessary <e> <s> the concession agreement provides that eurotunnel shall submit to the intergovernmental commission for approval their proposed safety arrangements and emergency procedures <e> <s> clearly the intergovernmental commission acting on the advice of the safety authority would not approve such arrangements unless it was satisfied that adequate evacuation measures were in place <e>", "<cs> i am not sure when the intergovernmental commission will give the final word but the safety authority is already working with eurotunnel on these matters <e> <s> in fact it will be an ongoing process <e> <s> i cannot say exactly when the final word of approval will be given but obviously plans are being put forward and looked at and presumably it is an ongoing discussion <e>", "<cs> the purpose of clause is to enable the secretary of state to ensure that any <e>", "<cs> as i said at the beginning it is up to british rail <e> <s> the government do quite a lot of work so far as cyclists are concerned in regard to other matters <e> <s> but particularly in this instance when british rail is to be required to operate a purely commercial service on this route it must be up to it to decide whether it is commercially viable to carry cyclists <e> <s> if it is well and good but if it is not as i said it could be a matter of having a lot of expensive space on the trains which might or might not be used by cyclists <e>", "<cs> it is a question to which i am sure i should know the answer but i am afraid i shall have to write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i can give one explanation which i hope will satisfy the noble lord <e> <s> the arrangements will be subject to the requirements of the intergovernmental commission but in addition they will have to take account of national requirements and that is where the secretary of state comes into it <e>", "<cs> i shall attempt to explain i hope to the satisfaction of the noble lord lord mulley <e> <s> i agree with him that clause is unusual in terms of its breadth and that some of the orders that we shall need to make will involve important issues of policy and principle <e> <s> one or two such issues are the conferring of extraterritorial powers for the purposes of juxtaposed frontier controls and the creation of new criminal offences peculiar to the tunnel system <e> <s> the government fully accept that orders dealing with major matters of this kind should be subject to the affirmative procedure <e> <s> in connection with the exercise of powers extraterritorially i must also emphasise that the order-making power in this clause will only be exercised having regard to the accepted rules of international law concerning jurisdiction <e>", "<cs> i understand that for the last years at least the affirmative procedure has taken the form of approval in draft <e> <s> that is how regulations implementing european community measures are dealt with <e> <s> that is as far as i can go in explanation at the moment <e>", "<cs> i am not able to reply to a point of such detail at this stage without notice <e> <s> i agree that i gave those figures for environmental improvements to the proposed scheme <e> <s> i am not sure that i follow the relevance of the different percentages <e> <s> presumably environmental improvements cost more in some places than they do in others <e> <s> i am afraid i shall have to read what the noble baroness has said and write to her on this subject <e>", "<cs> i do not quite follow that but i shall certainly read the noble baronesss remarks <e> <s> it seems to me that in some places environmental measures probably cost more than they do in others <e>", "<cs> i shall attempt to deal with your lordships questions in as much detail as possible <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend lord de la warr for having notified me in advance of the particular roads he was going to mention <e> <s> i have a map of them here <e>", "<cs> we are certainly in agreement that one of the main aims in building the tunnel is that the maximum use of the tunnel should be brought to all regions of the country particularly as the noble lord lord tordoff has said in terms of freight <e> <s> we have discussed passengers who will <e>", "<cs> the noble lord will be well aware that the government speak as one and therefore the department of transport the department of trade and industry and the treasury which is concerned with customs and excise all speak with one voice <e>", "<cs> i accept that of course but that is something for the future <e> <s> that is why i say that customs and excise will want to look at that point <e>", "<cs> i compliment the noble baroness for having moved this amendment <e> <s> once again it gives us the opportunity to discuss the fact that this bill and the proposed tunnel will bring benefits throughout the country and not just in the south-east <e> <s> that is the message that certainly the government have been trying to get across for a very long time <e>", "<cs> this is a fairly straight-forward issue <e> <s> it is a question of the sensible deadline for the preparation of the plan called for by this clause <e> <s> the feeling that the noble lord lord carmichael expressed is that st december would be insufficient time to implement the plan before the tunnel opens in may <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned again the inland customs depots as a factor <e>", "<cs> i think that the best thing i can do is to draw to the attention of british rail the remarks made in committee this evening <e> <s> i certainly undertake to do that <e>", "<cs> i think that the issue of waterloo has been discussed at great length both in this house and in another place <e> <s> an enormous amount of work was done by the select committee of your lordships house on whether waterloo should be the london terminal for the rail link <e> <s> in the governments view the committee were right to rule out any fresh assessment of the principle that the terminal should be at waterloo <e> <s> there will of course be many opportunities to discuss and refine the details but the basic choice of location must i think now be accepted <e> <s> british rail have already a great deal to do if they are to complete all their works in time for the opening of the tunnel <e> <s> if they now had to divert their energies into conducting another round of studies and consultations on the case for waterloo there would be a serious risk of the whole programme of works being delayed with damaging repercussions on the viability of british rails investment and an obvious risk that british rail would not be able to begin services when the tunnel opened <e> <s> if british rail did find themselves with that problem it would no doubt also affect through services to parts of the country other than london <e> <s> furthermore assuming <e>", "<cs> would be or will be torn to pieces by this proposal <e> <s> i cannot see that <e> <s> the noble lord lord mountevans gave an indication of the actual increase in traffic which will take place <e> <s> waterloo is already an extremely busy station and goodness knows how many commuters go in there every day <e> <s> i also recall that it was not so many years ago that lambeth actually wanted waterloo to be the london terminal of the channel tunnel link <e> <s> they seem totally to have ignored the fact that over jobs will be created by this <e> <s> so i very much hope that lambeth borough council and the various community groups who have opposed waterloo will now accept the select committees judgment and that they will join with british rail in discussing how the adverse effects of the development may be minimised and its positive benefits for the neighbourhood maximised <e> <s> i hope that the negative and head-in-the-sand attitudes will finally be removed <e>", "<cs> yes indeed it was <e> <s> it was largely a commercial decision on the part of british rail <e> <s> if british rail intends to be in business it must attract passengers to travel between paris and london and brussels and london on its railway <e> <s> british rail looked at something like different alternatives in the london area and it came down after a great deal of investigation and looking at many alternatives to waterloo <e>", "<cs> very well <e> <s> the noble lord is not suggesting that <e>", "<cs> i should like to know who the other experts are who suggested somewhere else <e> <s> british rail has been into this extremely carefully and the select committee looked at its evidence with great care and at great length <e> <s> waterloo appears to me to be the answer but i am not an expert on this i take the word of those who are and who have looked into it extremely carefully <e>", "<cs> i will briefly reply to that because it makes a change to have to defend a situation where the government have declined to give support to the railway or indeed the tunnel system as a whole <e> <s> it has been made very clear to us in the past in this chamber that this system has to operate competitively in free and fair competition with the ferry system and that is why we have introduced clause and also clause <e> <s> it was to meet the concern of the ferry operators that government funds might leak to the concessionaires in breach of the treaty through the medium of government support for british rails tunnel services <e>", "<cs> i agree in principle with the noble lords desire but i cannot accept that it is necessary or appropriate to impose the further safeguards called for in this new clause <e> <s> the noble lord recognises that contracts entered into by the board in pursuit of its commercial activities are likely to be commercially confidential <e> <s> his proposals for independent examination in such circumstances are aimed at overcoming that difficulty but even with that feature included the proposals are not acceptable to british rail or to the government <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may first explain that the usage contract does not require british rail to make any payments to eurotunnel before the tunnel opens <e> <s> they have agreed to pay a minimum monthly usage charge based on a proportion of the forecast traffic tolls <e> <s> in british rails view this represents a low commerical risk and in return they will be entitled to use per cent <e> <s> of the capacity of the tunnel for through trains <e>", "<cs> i first confirm that we are looking urgently at whether there should be an early commitment which i explained last thursday to provide on-train controls for through trains going beyond london <e> <s> this amendment would require british rail to pay any additional costs associated with on-train controls if it is decided to have them <e>", "<cs> i shall take the opportunity if i may of responding briefly to the amendment of the noble lord <e> <s> no doubt he can read what i have said and if necessary come back to the issue at another stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much hope that air transport will be back on the council agenda on th october <e> <s> this must of course depend upon whether the commission and the european parliament complete the new procedures required for the single european act by then <e> <s> on the second point made by the noble baroness about the offer of exemptions by the commission this is of course a matter for the commission <e> <s> however i understand that the commission does not intend to withdraw its proposal for group exemptions but instead is likely to put all its efforts into a new attempt to secure adoption of the package by the council including the group exemptions <e>", "<cs> no my lords at this stage it has not withdrawn its proposal for group exemptions <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed there are at the moment proposals before the commission as part of the second stage <e> <s> the noble lord will be aware that the first stage of the shipping policy was agreed last december <e> <s> the commission is currently working on proposals for a second stage of the common shipping policy the proposals are aimed at harmonising aids which are given by community governments to their merchant fleets and indeed strengthening the position of community shipping industries in world markets <e> <s> that might also arise in the course of discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords dealing with the first point made by the noble baroness between now and th october the government will be working very closely with the commission to bring the package back to the council in its present form <e> <s> we shall be doing all we can to resolve the problem over gibraltar <e> <s> i hope the house will recognise that the room for manoeuvre is limited <e> <s> we shall also be exploring with other ec countries the possibility of new bilateral arrangements based upon the political agreements reached in luxembourg <e>", "<cs> my lords i hate to enter into an argument with the noble baroness but agreement was reached on the package with the single exception of the issue of spain and gibraltar <e> <s> therefore i think the commission feels that the best way forward is by agreement with the council in sorting out the problem of gibraltar rather than embarking upon court action through article <e> <s> that procedure would be lengthy and the results uncertain <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i cannot take up the noble lord on his last suggestion <e> <s> the noble baroness and the government are at one in wanting to achieve liberalisation of european air transport and i am merely trying to explain what we think is the best way forward to achieve that <e>", "<cs> my lords since bypasses have been completed in england and are presently under construction <e> <s> in their road building programme the government attach the highest priority to the construction of bypasses <e>", "<cs> my lords i was under the impression that england and scotland were connected principally by the a which i believe on the whole is a fairly high-class road <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures that are not available for scotland relate only to the reconstruction of trunk roads <e> <s> this is not recorded as a separate activity in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the same point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not able to answer in detail on individual road schemes <e> <s> the government have recently published the white paper on <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope very much that what is in the white paper will indeed be started on time <e> <s> we have increased our expenditure for investment in the future by a total of per cent <e> <s> over the next three years and this should allow the present momentum of the programme to be maintained <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have an answer to that question at the moment <e> <s> however i recall that the proposals for an inner road around london did not meet with universal favour <e> <s> so far as i know we have no proposals to reconsider that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to the noble lady <e> <s> i cannot answer specific questions on specific roads at question time <e> <s> i shall find out and write to the noble lady <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of the amendment is similar to that of the amendment which the noble baroness put down at committee stage <e> <s> it would require eurotunnel to make provision for the safe embarkation carriage and evacuation of persons who are disabled <e> <s> i suggested at that time that she should withdraw it because it was too broad for inclusion in a statute and as i told your lordships eurotunnel was already giving full consideration to the needs of persons with disabilities <e> <s> however many noble lords obviously consider that there is nevertheless a need for a provision in the statute to ensure that eurotunnel caters appropriately for the disabled <e> <s> the amendment now before your lordships suggests that there should be a code of practice on these matters and i am glad to say that this approach is acceptable to the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble lord lord mulley will be disappointed if he is hoping for the same response that i gave to the previous amendment <e> <s> i should first like to comment on the realism of the noble lords concern that <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may just ask the noble lord whether he was intending to speak to amendment no <e> <s> at the same time <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that that amendment is consequential upon this one <e> <s> the first point i have to make is that the noble lord lord mulley may be under a misapprehension about the establishment of the safety authority <e> <s> although the treaty as a whole is not yet in force an exchange of letters between the governments signed at the same time as the treaty and annexed to it in the relevant command paper recorded the agreement of the governments to apply provisionally articles and and thus to set up the intergovernmental commission and the safety authority on a provisional basis <e>", "<cs> my lords let me assure the house and the noble lords who have spoken in support of the clause that there is no difference between the government british rail and eurotunnel about the desire to see the tunnel used for freight services from all parts of the country provided that those services can pay their way on a proper commercial basis <e> <s> i want to make that point clear at the outset lest my remarks about the specific proposal before the house be misunderstood as implying indifference to the future of either british rail or the less prosperous regions <e> <s> the governments support for british rails overall investment programme and the governments initiatives in regard to the inner cities are there to be seen though i grant that they are not the point at issue today <e>", "<cs> my lords as i explained last week when the committee discussed an amendment on this subject proposed by the noble lord the government cannot possibly object to the underlying aims of the new clause <e> <s> the new clause proposed today benefits from last weeks debate and is directed all the more effectively at the real issues <e> <s> clearly it is most undesirable that customs and immigration facilities at the ports should suffer before the tunnel opens because officers are withdrawn for training or familiarisation <e> <s> equally one would not wish a port to suffer more than a proportionate reduction in the manning levels for customs and immigration once the tunnel does open <e> <s> the difficulty however is that in a world where customs are trying to be as fair as they possibly can to all parties these things may happen and the terms used in the noble lords draft clause are inevitably rather imprecise so that the clause is inevitably rather ineffective <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to answer a couple of the points that have been raised <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord ampthill for his remarks because he has said what i was trying to say in my first speech <e> <s> this afternoon we are concerned with the equality of misery between dover harbour board and eurotunnel if i may put it that way <e> <s> i have tried to be forthright in my undertaking that we shall be even-handed <e> <s> the debate has then gone on as it did last time into the overall resources available for customs and excise and whether or not they are sufficient <e> <s> the noble lords lord harris and lord mulley mentioned that matter <e> <s> i shall pass on to my right honourable friend who is responsible for the customs service the concern expressed by your lordships this afternoon <e> <s> there is scarcely a country <e>", "<cs> my lords that point has been gone into at some length <e> <s> the harbour authorities and the ferry operators realise that it would not work very well in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords as has been explained this new clause is concerned with the ferry operators desire to integrate or to co-ordinate their services so as to be better able to compete with the eurotunnel service <e> <s> the new clause would require the director general of fair trading when considering any such proposals by the companies <e>", "<cs> my lords i did grasp the point and as i develop my remarks the noble lord will see that we are well aware of the problem which he is worried about that is that the director general of fair trading should consider any proposals by the companies especially in relation to trade and tourism in the period before the tunnel opens <e> <s> i accept that this is an important point <e> <s> indeed it is almost exactly the consideration which the select committee recommended should be taken into account by the director general at paragraph of the special report to which reference has been made <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i can certainly give the assurance that the director will see what has been said today <e>", "<cs> my lords i should very much like to endorse what the noble lord lord harris of greenwich has just said <e> <s> we shall be coming to an amendment a little later on which addresses the position of waterloo that is the terminal rather than as in this amendment the scheduling of train services <e>", "<cs> my lords i briefly mentioned the departments intention in relation to the m/a in response to an amendment at committee stage <e> <s> as my noble friend lord teviot has mentioned i have since written to him <e> <s> i can quite understand my noble friends concern about the possible inadequacy of the m and also that of the noble lords lord ampthill and lord tordoff <e> <s> traffic on the m/a is fully expected to decrease <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords who have spoken on this amendment and for the general welcome given to it <e> <s> on the question of waterloo i said that there was nothing in <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment would i believe although i cannot be sure have the effect of preventing the secretary of state from appointing as head of the united kingdom delegation to the channel tunnel safety authority a serving civil servant or such other person who in any other way was subject to control by the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i have given the reasons i do not feel that the house should accept this amendment and i do not think it would be for the convenience of the house if i went into all the reasons all over again <e>", "<cs> my lords i am rather disappointed that the noble lord lord underhill has returned to this subject at this stage as i had hoped that what i said in committee would have convinced him that the proposal was unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords we had quite an extensive and useful debate on smoking during committee stage when we discussed whether it would be reasonable for a comprehensive ban on smoking to be applied throughout the tunnel system <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to comment briefly on that matter <e> <s> i am sure that there will be orders <e> <s> however i am waiting for advice from the safety authority through the intergovernmental commission before i can say that <e> <s> that is what those bodies are for <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord mentioned i wrote to him concerning the points he raised on insurance <e> <s> it is a fairly long detailed and complicated letter which i have placed in the library for noble lords to see <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble viscount admitted he tabled the same amendment in committee and your lordships will not be surprised that my response is unchanged <e> <s> british rails international services are to be run on a strictly commercial basis with no support from public funds <e> <s> this is a matter of government policy but it is also the object of clause of the bill accepted last week in committee <e> <s> it must therefore be for the british <e>", "<cs> my lords we have already debated the need for british rail to plan for traffic growth after the tunnel has opened <e> <s> if traffic grows year after year there will inevitably come a time when waterloo reaches the limits of its capacity <e> <s> as i said in the committee stage debate even on the most optimistic forecasts that time will not be reached until at the earliest <e>", "<cs> my lords the duty imposed on the central transport consultative committee and the area committees by section of the transport act requires them to consider and make recommendations about domestic british rail <e>", "<cs> my lords i wrote to the noble lord lord mulley on this subject as he has just said and a copy has also been placed in the library of the house for any other noble lord who is interested in this particular point <e> <s> i gather the principal reason is that an enactment is not defined in the interpretation act <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right to probe into this matter <e> <s> it is a little difficult to understand why northern ireland should be included in this bill <e> <s> i shall try to explain <e> <s> although it concerns a fairly remote possibility the government considered it advisable to cater for it in drafting this bill <e> <s> under clause the supervisory bodies namely the intergovernmental commission and the safety authority can issue directions to any person carry out investigations and require information to be given <e> <s> it is impossible to predict the circumstances in which these powers may be used but it is most likely that they would be used in relation to persons or bodies directly involved in constructing or operating the channel system <e> <s> however it is not inconceivable that in investigating an incident or checking upon safe practice it may be necessary to seek information from suppliers of materials or equipment or even to issue them with directions <e> <s> there is no reason therefore to limit such provisions to great britain because supplies and materials could have come from anywhere in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i must disabuse the noble lord of that idea <e> <s> when he reads what i have said he will find that i did not say at all what he thinks i said <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house once more perhaps i may say that i am informed that scotland is covered implicitly by english legislation <e> <s> no special provision is needed <e> <s> all prosecutions in scotland require the agreement of the procurator fiscal <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that it is not any fault of the government that the report will be issued on th july <e> <s> that is a matter entirely in the hands of the judge <e> <s> we have not sought to influence him in any way other than that he was well aware that we wanted the report to be published as soon as possible <e> <s> as regards any matters which arise from the report we shall act as speedily as we possibly can bearing in mind the great public interest and concern for the safety of ferries <e> <s> i can give the noble lord the assurance that although parliament may not be sitting ministers will not all be on holiday during those few months <e>", "<cs> my lords it is clear that on the short haul ferries passenger lists will not always be completed <e> <s> nevertheless if when the court reports it makes any recommendations on the matter i shall consider it carefully <e> <s> what is absolutely essential is that the correct numbers are accounted for <e> <s> that is something that has not been done properly and must be done in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we shall indeed be considering this <e> <s> we are talking about very many more people on ferries than on aircraft <e> <s> there are difficulties in compiling an accurate list <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we have our statutory responsibilities for the safety of shipping <e>", "<cs> my lords that is one of the difficulties in attempting to get a full passenger list on the short sea crossings <e> <s> i am tempted to ask if it were made appropriate for cross-channel ferries whether it would be necessary for instance on the isle of wight ferry which i know from personal experience would be extremely difficult to organise <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall of course be studying the recommendations of the court very carefully <e> <s> as i said in answer to an earlier supplementary question research has already been commissioned to consider the viability of the different options available and this will have to be taken into account in any decision <e> <s> i take note of what the noble viscount has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i understood from the noble lord who in particular had evidence to give but i am sure that they would have given it at the inquiry <e> <s> this whole matter was dealt with in great detail at the inquiry <e> <s> no doubt that will be taken into account when the inspector submits his report <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that we have not been idle <e> <s> we have recommended the fitting of warning lights and television cameras to the ferries <e> <s> i understand that nearly all the ferry companies have done so <e> <s> we shall of course be considering in the light of the report whether these should be made a mandatory requirement <e> <s> marine surveyors have also inspected all cross-channel ferries and have made certain that the procedures for closing the watertight doors are being complied with properly <e>", "<cs> my lords there is very little more i can say about passenger lists <e> <s> there would be benefits in having a full passenger list it is just a question of its practical application <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the noble lords point <e> <s> that is a possibility <e> <s> it is not as good as trying to open up all coasts within the community <e> <s> as i say it is a situation which we take extremely seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords it did not take long on monday in this house for the euphoria of the governments new clause in respect of on-train controls to be overtaken by the argument if it can be done for trains beyond london why not for trains to waterloo too <e> <s> that came as no surprise to the government but i should make it clear at the outset that the government did not limit what is now in clause to trains beyond london because that was the least they felt they could get away with <e> <s> it was because the balance of advantage and disadvantage of imposing a duty on the government is really very different in respect of the waterloo services <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i have not heard that announcement <e> <s> i only hope that during the course of the next six years we shall be able to sort out that question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for having raised the matter <e> <s> we have in the interim taken advice from the scottish law officers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord sefton for his kind words at the opening of his speech <e> <s> the reason i have not written to him on the subject is that there was not enough time <e> <s> i felt it was easier to answer his questions here and now in the house this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords there is very little more i can say <e> <s> if the noble lord reads what i have said this afternoon i think he will see that there is definitely going to be a certain level of insurance available which has to be enough to satisfy the intergovernmental commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords may i very briefly close this debate by thanking all noble lords who have been kind enough to pay tribute to my handling of the bill in your lordships house <e> <s> a number of noble lords notably the noble lord lord underhill and my noble friend lord sandford have said that this bill now places a heavy responsibility upon british rail to make sure that they take the freight opportunities which lie before them around the whole country <e> <s> i can only endorse those sentiments and hope that british rail will rise to the occasion and get this traffic which would be so valuable both to them and in terms of taking traffic off the roads <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be helpful at this point if i briefly intervened to restate the governments view on the bill <e> <s> i apologise to noble lords that my name was missed off the list of speakers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord bruce of donington and lord strabolgi for their general acceptance of the order laid before your lordships this afternoon <e> <s> in answer to the question of the noble lord lord bruce of donington i understand that building societies are content with the order and its contents <e> <s> in regard to giving the noble lord an assurance that withdrawals made from building societies to pay for applications for privatisation or indeed any other kind of share issue mean that the building societies remain in a position to fulfil their part of the order laid before your lordships that is a matter for the commission <e> <s> i am sure that the commission will watch out for that but i think that in actual fact the amounts of money about which we are talking are relatively small in comparison with the overall figures for building society investments especially when one takes into account the amount of money which goes back after unsuccessful applications have been taken account of <e>", "<cs> my lords completion of arrangements for bringing the package back to the council depends on a further opinion from the european parliament which cannot now be delivered until after the summer break <e> <s> on the noble baronesss second point the commission does not intend to withdraw its proposals for giving group exemptions as that would have the effect of destroying the package <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the noble baroness a positive answer to her first question about whether the european parliament will have completed its deliberations by october <e> <s> i very much hope that that will be the case but it certainly will have done by december <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i can assist my noble friend <e> <s> it is a matter for the european parliament and for the commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i can go no further than i already have in my answer <e>", "<cs> my lords we are straying from the question on the order paper which is about the liberalisation of european air transport in respect of the package which we have discussed on many occasions <e> <s> i am afraid i can go no further on the subject of the merger <e>", "<cs> my lords i answered that question when i said i understood that the commission is interested in the case <e> <s> on the noble baronesss first question i very much hope that the european parliament will have considered the matter by the october council <e> <s> i cannot give a guarantee on that <e> <s> in any case i would hope that if it has not done so by then it will have done so by december <e>", "<cs> my lords we are going a very long way from the question on the order paper <e> <s> i have already said that i cannot speculate on the matter as it is in the hands of the director general of fair trading at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am giving careful consideration to the lights advisory committees proposal for a review of the traditional aids to navigation <e> <s> i shall take this forward in conjunction with our study of a separate report on future developments in marine navigational aids which also recommended a scrutiny with the users and lighthouse authorities of the present range of lights and daymarks <e> <s> the general lighthouse authorities are the bodies responsible for these matters and i shall be pursuing these proposals in conjunction with them <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise the concern that is felt by the lights advisory committee and by my noble friend on this issue <e> <s> however i do not think that the matter is so simple <e> <s> even some of the larger vessels need to use those aids we also collect from smaller vessels <e> <s> however we are doing what we can to try to deal with this situation <e> <s> as i said in my original answer we look very carefully at the proposals that are put before us as indeed do the general lighthouse authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the situation and i certainly hold the view of the noble lord lord carmichael that there is no question of all navigational aids being removed <e> <s> some are certainly very necessary <e> <s> as i said we are studying two separate reports one from the lights advisory committee and the other commissioned by ourselves and there is a further report on the tender vessel requirements <e> <s> we shall move forward as fast as we can but i cannot give a certain date when we may be able to take action <e> <s> it is for the general lighthouse authorities in consultation with us to decide what to do <e>", "<cs> my lords any question of closures would be for the general lighthouse authority concerned which always consults the users when contemplating withdrawals <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said it is a matter for the general lighthouse authorities and they consult the users when proposing changes <e>", "<cs> my lords within the limits of administrative practicability the government think it right that the costs of the lighthouse service should be met by those who use the services <e> <s> i can hold out no prospect of the exchequer taking over the million annual cost of those services <e>", "<cs> my lords there is an increased danger where motorway repairs are taking place <e> <s> in fact i understand that accidents are twice as likely to happen in such situations <e> <s> we do our best with regard to contraflow systems to deal with the situation <e> <s> for instance we have plans to try moving cones for more minor repairs <e>", "<cs> my lords in the case of three-lane motorways lorries are not supposed to travel in the fast lane <e>", "<cs> my lords the police must do their best to make sure that they do not <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true to say that accidents on motorways are more likely to be serious than those on ordinary roads because of the increased speeds <e> <s> as regards the research which is being done i shall have to look into the matter and find out what the trrl is doing at the moment <e> <s> perhaps i may write to the noble lord on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords enforcement of speed limits is a matter for the police <e> <s> it must be obvious that the law cannot be enforced per cent <e> <s> it is a matter for the police to do the best they can within the resources available to them <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble and learned friend knows much more about that than i do <e> <s> i am sure that he is right concerning the question of sentencing by magistrates courts <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall take that suggestion away and look at it <e>", "<cs> my lords i hasten to assure the noble earl that the figures which i have given are not those for fatal accidents <e> <s> fortunately the number of fatal accidents has not been nearly as high as the figures i have mentioned <e> <s> i do not have with me a better analysis of the figures if that is available <e> <s> however the latest group of road accident figures will be published next week and a copy will be in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with the noble lord that such accidents are appalling <e> <s> we shall do all we possibly can to prevent such accidents from happening <e> <s> however at the end of the day i must point out that the risk of having an accident on an ordinary road is eight times greater than it is on a motorway <e> <s> that must be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that all airlines involved have now responded and that the commission is now considering what further action to take <e> <s> this is of course a matter for the commission <e> <s> but i can say that the commission like the british government puts its top priority on securing adoption by the council of ministers of the aviation liberalisation package and sees its action with the airlines as supporting that objective <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble baroness that i am just as frustrated with the lack of progress as she is <e> <s> the government welcome the initiative of british airways as a useful step towards a more competitive environment <e> <s> we do not believe it will impact directly on the consumer at least in the short term <e> <s> an airlines ability to offer cheaper fares depends upon the relaxation of the regulatory controls <e> <s> hence the most important thing is to get the aviation package back on the council agenda as soon as possible and get it agreed <e>", "<cs> my lords that is indeed true <e> <s> however we still will not get as far as the other measures we want within europe that is multiple designation and lower air fares but it is definitely a step in the right direction <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a little far from the question

visit during the recess <e> <s> both airports are showing a very positive increase in activity at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the european communities definition of treaties international convention on the harmonised commodity description and coding system order laid before the house on th june be approved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords who have spoken on this motion and i shall attempt to deal with the points which have been raised <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord bruce of donington for having given me advance notice of the

assure the noble lord that the powers we have to think about things that have happened to the british economy in the last week will be exercised <e> <s> as i said earlier i am <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not certain i appreciate the intention of the noble lords remark <e> <s> so far as sterling is concerned it has been extremely firm in the last week and is even firmer today <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord has misunderstood me <e> <s> i said that we must no doubt think using our powers of thought as to what might be done about the equity markets <e> <s> i said that in answer to the question from the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> as regards joining the exchange rate mechanism i do not see what that has got to do with it <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly not <e> <s> we are straying rather a long way from the question on the order paper <e> <s> what the noble lord has implied that i said i certainly did not say <e>", "<cs> my lords when the time is ripe <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> regarding the cancellation of th october council we first need to resolve the dispute with spain over gibraltar airport <e> <s> bilateral talks aim at resolving this issue by the time the uk and spanish foreign ministers meet on th november <e> <s> secondly a further opinion on the package is awaited from the european parliament and it has been asked to produce that in time for the th december council <e>", "<cs> my lords we are obviously in constant touch with the chairman of the civil aviation authority <e> <s> there is very little that i can add to what i said last week on the subject <e> <s> we are very keen to get this package through and very much hope that it will go through by the end of the year <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept that there will necessarily be that much pressure on air space as a result of the adoption of the package <e> <s> there is still capacity to spare in the south-east <e> <s> there is also capacity available elsewhere in the country <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to other airlines it was british airways that was taken to court so to speak by the commission over this matter as well as british caledonian <e> <s> all the other airlines were foreign so that it did not apply to any other uk airlines <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to amend the law relating to the registration of ships to make provision for the giving of financial assistance in connection with the training of seamen and crew relief costs to make provision for the establishment of a merchant navy reserve to make further provisions with respect to the safety of shipping with respect to liability and compensation for oil pollution and with respect to the financing and administration of the lighthouse service to make other amendments of the law relating to shipping seamen and pollution and for connected purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my original answer british rail wished the tender to go to manufacturers of engines rather than manufacturers of locomotives and british rail engineering limited does not manufacture engines <e> <s> it is not true to say that british firms have not been invited to tender <e> <s> i understand that both gec and hawker siddeley brush have tendered <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that it is disadvantageous to brel not to be able to tender as the main contractor <e> <s> in fact in many ways it gives it a better chance of getting business than if it had been the main contractor <e> <s> if brel had been the main contractor it would have either won or lost the tender <e> <s> as it is it can tender for subcontracting work from anybody who wins the tender <e> <s> the redundancies at brel have no connection with the question of tenders for the new locomotive <e> <s> job losses are due to a fall in the repair and maintenance workload and much of that is an inevitable consequence of investment in modern rolling stock which is designed to need much less maintenance and repair <e>", "<cs> my lords if brel is a successful subcontractor in this contract it will of course gain from it <e> <s> but as i said this proposed contract is not a reason for the redundancies at brel <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already said british rail decided that it wanted to go to an engine contractor rather than a locomotive contractor as the main contractor for this project <e> <s> british rail engineering does not make engines <e> <s> the chairman of british rail has however said on a number of occasions that br <e> <s> would prefer to buy british if uk manufacturers can match overseas competition <e> <s> i am sure that my right honourable friend would endorse that thinking of the board <e>", "<cs> my lords that would be a matter for british rail <e> <s> it has of course invited two british firms anyway that i know of to tender for this work and i hope that they are successful <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously i appreciate the concern of the right reverend prelate the bishop of derby but i have to say that british rail engineering has to compete for new build orders both at home and abroad <e> <s> so far as at home is concerned british rail plans to spend billion on new locomotives and rolling stock over the next five years so there will be plenty of business around to be tendered for <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly sympathise with the views of my noble friend <e> <s> in the past british rail has not always got the best equipment that it might have got <e> <s> that is why i believe that it is taking a more commercial view about the tendering process in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no details with me at the moment <e> <s> but i think it is a fact that is widely recognised that some of the equipment it has had in the past has not been reliable <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate has been both important and timely <e> <s> important because of the large sums of money involved in the proposals under discussion and also of course because of our very real commitment to the european community <e> <s> timely because we are now in the thick of negotiations on the future financing of the community leading up to the european council at copenhagen next month <e>", "<cs> my lords our debate today has been both thought-provoking and realistic <e> <s> i am grateful to all noble lords who have taken part <e> <s> the bill covering as it does so many different aspects of merchant shipping has given us a good opportunity to range widely over the shipping industry generally <e> <s> noble lords have touched on many important and topical issues particularly the problems of ships safety raised by the loss of the herald of free enterprise and the position of the united kingdom registered fleet <e> <s> i shall say a little about those two point first before i move on to some of the other details about which noble lords asked me <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall use my best endeavours to get them as quickly as we possibly can <e>", "<cs> my lords that must be british rails decision <e> <s> they are responsible for the day-to-day operation of the railways <e> <s> i shall draw my noble friends remarks to the attention of british rail but it would be wrong for ministers to intervene in such operational matters <e>", "<cs> my lords british rails decision to electrify the east coast main line was i should have thought a very satisfactory one for newcastle <e> <s> it is a large investment and it is going well <e> <s> the fact is that nowadays hardly anybody is using these sleeper services <e> <s> british rail estimates according to the figures it has given me that it loses about a head on the sleeper services to that part of the country <e> <s> it must be right especially as the ordinary trains have become faster and there is increasing competition from airlines and coach services to remove the sleeper services <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has a great deal of experience with the management of british rail <e> <s> however i have tried to make it clear that ministers should not become involved in day-to-day operational matters <e> <s> otherwise i suspect that no one at all would be prepared to run british rail <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a possibility for british rail to look into <e> <s> the sleeper service will continue to edinburgh using the west coast route <e> <s> british rail believes that it can provide a better service in that way <e> <s> it is worth pointing out to noble lords i do not have a total figure for usage that for instance if one takes a station such as berwick on the east coast route less than one person a train uses that station on the sleeper service <e> <s> it therefore hardly makes sense to keep it going <e>", "<cs> my lords most recently i travelled on a sleeper to plymouth <e> <s> british rail has said that it will make sleeping compartments more comfortable <e> <s> as minister for aviation i always try to travel by air whenever possible <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said it is a management decision for british rail <e> <s> the services to edinburgh will continue but they will use the different route which british rail considers will be more satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier i shall certainly draw the remarks that all noble lords have made this afternoon to the attention of british rail <e> <s> however i tried to explain to the noble lord lord glenamara that british rail is investing a good deal of money in the east coast services <e> <s> the fact that there will no longer be sleeper services on that line should not make that much difference <e> <s> the route has become much faster over the past few years and fewer people appear to want to use sleeper car services <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that strays a little away from the question that i am trying to answer today <e> <s> it will be included in british rails reading of <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> we believe that the aviation package will be on the agenda on th december <e> <s> the substance of the package was agreed unanimously in june <e> <s> intensive bilateral negotiations are continuing with spain aimed at resolving the gibraltar problem <e> <s> however it was never the intention that formal adoption of the package should depend on the outcome of bilateral talks <e>", "<cs> my lords no that is not quite right <e> <s> the council of ministers may adopt a proposal that is before it by qualified majority <e> <s> article of the treaty requires unanimity if the council is to amend the commissions proposals <e> <s> if the commissions proposals are not to be amended they can be decided by qualified majority <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that they could be affected by qualified majority voting <e> <s> however on the noble lords second point about capacity the possible effect of liberalisation on the underlying trend towards larger aircraft was taken into account in the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i tried to indicate that the whole package that was agreed in june by the council of ministers but which is held up at present by the dispute with spain is subject to qualified majority voting now and that could happen on th december <e>", "<cs> my lords if the council wishes to amend the commissions proposals which is not the case at present it can do that only by unanimity <e> <s> if it wishes to adopt the proposals which have been produced by the commission it can do that by qualified majority voting <e>", "<cs> my lords if the commission has made or approved the proposal the council of ministers can then use qualified majority voting <e> <s> if however the council wishes to amend or alter the commissions proposals that has to be decided by unanimity <e>", "<cs> my lords we have been having intensive bilateral talks with the spaniards <e> <s> these are still going on <e> <s> senior officials are engaged in intensive discussions and will be talking further next week <e> <s> the foreign secretaries meet together at the end of this month and hopefully in time for the th december transport council <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement which has been made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport about the fire at kings cross station last night <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to both noble lords for their reception of the statement <e> <s> i join in the tribute to the marvellous <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i cannot accept this amendment because it ignores the basic <e>", "<cs> obviously we shall come a little later in the course of the bill to what we propose to do to assist shipping companies with training <e> <s> as i said in my opening remarks i hope that will encourage british shipowners to use british seafarers <e> <s> so indeed should the measures that we shall come to later as regards repatriation costs <e> <s> but even with those measures there has been a long tradition in certain shipping companies to employ foreign seafarers <e> <s> i think particularly of cruise ships and passenger ships where many of the stewards are indian and have always been indian so far as i know <e> <s> if we sought to stop that happening those companies would very likely flag out <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend has explained the purpose of amendment no <e> <s> with which we are dealing is to make our registration policy more restrictive in certain areas than it is at present <e> <s> it is true as the noble lord lord parry has said that we are doing just that for fishing vessels <e> <s> however we do it against the background of the ec common fisheries policy which allocates a national quota to us and which we are safeguarding for uk fishermen <e> <s> the amendment puts severe limitations on any foreign investment in the fishing industry <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> provided that the company is incorporated in the united kingdom it does not matter who owns the shares in that company <e> <s> the ships are eligible to be registered here <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for his remarks because i am not going to be able to deal with the proposal in all that friendly a manner <e> <s> the amendment imposes an unnecessary requirement <e> <s> as i said on second reading the representative person is not responsible for the owners acts or omissions but provides a means whereby legal documents can be served on the owner <e> <s> if the owner fails to respond then certain consequences including removal from the register can flow <e> <s> what matters for the service of documents is that the individual or company appointed should be resident in the united kingdom <e> <s> subsection <e>", "<cs> under clause any regulations made under the bill including those relating to representative persons in this clause are placed before parliament for approval under the negative resolution procedure <e> <s> the amendment would require regulations made under this clause to be subject to affirmative resolution <e> <s> the regulations deal with the technical details of the requirements for a representative person for ships owned by qualified persons not resident in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> it is the subsidiary which has its principal place of business in the united kingdom <e> <s> there are many examples of shipping companies into which category would fall a company such as that represented by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that it would be helpful to introduce this wide element of discretion into the registration process <e> <s> under the present law and under the bill as introduced a ship is entitled to be registered if it meets the statutory criteria which are clearly laid down <e> <s> the grounds on which registration may be refused under the bill are equally clear <e> <s> they are failure to meet the eligibility requirements the condition of the ship in so far as is relevant to its safety or to any risk of pollution and the safety health and welfare of persons employed on board <e> <s> these requirements are important and specific <e> <s> to these the amendment would add a consideration that is very broad and quite different in character the national interest <e>", "<cs> at the present time i can only confirm the figures which i have given and which the noble lord has found in the notes on clauses <e> <s> they are on summary conviction and an unlimited fine on conviction on indictment <e> <s> i am told that the bill uses the normal drafting <e> <s> however i shall write to the noble lord lord underhill and expand on that <e>", "<cs> we need to have a system of provisional certificates to deal with the case of a ship acquired abroad but the present system as the <e>", "<cs> i cannot agree that our change to the act would negate the purpose of provisional registry <e> <s> we intend to make it clear in new guidance to consuls and high commissions that a simple letter to a united kingdom registrar declaring that the owner wishes to apply for full registration will suffice as evidence that such an application has been made <e> <s> i hope that meets my noble friends point and that he will be able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> there is obviously a difference of opinion between my noble friends and others and the noble lord opposite which leads me to believe that the government have probably got the period of time about right <e> <s> as the noble lord lord underhill mentioned it was originally one month in the green paper proposals but following consultation with the general council of british shipping we have put forward the three months that we have in the bill at present <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for raising this matter because it gives me the opportunity to expand on our proposals in this clause and on the criteria which we would use in assigning dependent territories to appropriate categories <e>", "<cs> we consult the general council regularly on virtually every subject in merchant shipping <e> <s> i can give my noble friend the assurance that we shall consult it in respect of this matter <e>", "<cs> we have probably heard deployed on this amendment some of the arguments that more properly relate to the amendment of the noble lord lord parry which will come up next about the whole issue of the common fisheries policy quota-hopping and so on <e> <s> my noble friend lord campbell of croy said that there are about quota-hopping flag of convenience fishing vessels on the uk register <e> <s> i have to tell him that the figure at the moment is approximately <e> <s> so it is a serious problem <e>", "<cs> we all admire the noble lord lord parry for the eloquence with which he moved the amendment and for the deep interest which he has in milford haven and in wales <e> <s> however the fact is that the amendment would completely undermine the purpose of this part of the bill which is to preserve united kingdom quotas for united kingdom fishermen <e> <s> as noble lords have said the ec quota system has worked well which is perhaps more than can be said for some other parts of the common agricultural policy <e>", "<cs> where to set the relevant percentage is to some extent a matter of judgment <e> <s> we believe the figure of per cent <e> <s> which is a stringent one is as much as is necessary to secure the objectives which we have in the bill <e> <s> it would not be helpful either to set a figure which might be thought in brussels or elsewhere to be disproportionate to the problem we are trying to solve <e>", "<cs> the answer to that is i should like to see how the thing works out <e> <s> if our aims do not appear to be working out that might be the time when we would have to raise the limit <e>", "<cs> the object of the exercise is to eliminate quota-hopping <e> <s> if we find that by setting a figure of per cent <e> <s> for ownership we eliminate quota-hopping then we will have achieved our objective <e> <s> that is really all i can say about it <e>", "<cs> we are all agreed on the importance of training to the industry <e> <s> that was made clear on second reading and indeed again by my noble friends and the noble lord opposite this afternoon <e>", "<cs> as drafted this amendment would mean that funding in respect of merchant navy training could be provided only to british citizens serving on ships manned by uk certificated officers <e> <s> as i have already explained our intention at present is to provide financial assistance to those organisations primarily shipping companies who sponsor and employ cadets rather than to the cadets themselves <e> <s> the amendment would prevent that <e> <s> but from the comments made by the noble lord lord underhill i understand that the intention behind the amendment is to limit the assistance to costs incurred by companies in respect of the training of british citizens on ships manned by <e>", "<cs> as i explained on the previous amendment the powers have deliberately been widely drawn to allow sufficient flexibility in the administering of the assistance scheme which is being developed <e> <s> in practice i would certainly expect the financial assistance towards seafaring training to be provided in the form of grant <e> <s> however i do not think that we should rule out the possibility that other forms of funding might also be appropriate <e> <s> for this reason it is important that the present flexibility should be maintained <e>", "<cs> i am able to answer without taking advice <e> <s> our primary priority is of course to tackle the shortage of cadets <e> <s> but i certainly would not rule out the possibility of assistance for officers training for higher qualifications and of course the powers in the bill will allow for this <e> <s> i hope that goes some way to meeting the noble lords concern <e>", "<cs> my answer to this amendment is really going to be very similar to that <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the intention behind the amendment of the noble lord lord carmichael <e> <s> there must of course be some restriction on those who may benefit from the assistance which the government will be providing under this clause <e> <s> our intention is that the restrictions should be twofold a restriction on the place of registration of the vessel and restrictions on the crew members in respect of which crew relief costs will be made available <e> <s> the restriction on registration is in clause a which makes it clear that the ship must be registered in the british islands <e> <s> this means that under part i of the bill the shipowner will have to be a person or company eligible to register a ship in the british islands that is the united kingdom channel islands or the isle of man <e>", "<cs> i am not sure where it is defined <e> <s> the british islands are the channel islands and the isle of man <e> <s> they are normally known as crown dependencies <e> <s> i cannot read what my note says but the definition comes from a well-known act of <e>", "<cs> as i said in answer to an earlier amendment moved by the noble lord lord underhill all regulations under the bill with respect to conditions of service of members of the merchant navy reserve would be subject to parliamentary approval under the negative resolution procedure <e> <s> i appreciate that many of these regulations are important and may well warrant debate both here and in the other place <e> <s> but negative resolution procedures does not rule this out and i am not convinced that affirmative resolution procedure <e>", "<cs> in fact it is not a question of accepting the amendment because section of the act was repealed under provisions in the merchant shipping act <e> <s> perhaps i may go into a little of the background and reply to what the noble lord has said about commonwealth officers <e>", "<cs> my lords progress on the east coast main line is ahead of schedule <e> <s> there should be no problem in meeting the target on the london to leeds service of august a year earlier than planned and on the london to edinburgh service of <e> <s> full electric service from london to huntington and peterborough started in may slightly ahead of schedule <e>", "<cs> my lords it is for british rail to put forward proposals to the government for future electrification <e> <s> the government have received no such proposal from british rail <e>", "<cs> my lords since this government have been in office we have turned down no proposals by british rail for schemes of this kind <e> <s> as regards electrification which is the subject of this question between and an average of million a year was spent at todays prices <e> <s> since an average of million has been spent at todays prices <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i think that we can be confident of that <e> <s> as the noble baroness will be aware british rail makes special efforts to cater for disabled people and a member of the board looks after this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords that would of course be a matter for british rail <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord is more aware than i am of the situation on that line but so far as the government are concerned i understand that no proposal has been put forward by british rail for electrification of that particular line <e>", "<cs> certainly my lords there are good economic benefits from electrification <e> <s> it should also result in slightly improved journey times greater reliability and more comfort for passengers <e>", "<cs> my lords i answered a question on that subject not very long ago <e> <s> so far as i understand from british rail it is proposed that from next year the trains will be using the west coast route from euston to edinburgh and i understand that it will be a permanent measure <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand it is hoped that when electrification is completed the journey time between london and edinburgh which is currently four hours minutes will be reduced to about four hours in other words there will be a reduction of about minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> we have had an interesting short debate on this amendment and i believe that we have all listened with care to what the noble lord lord underhill and other noble lords have said <e> <s> i hope that the committee will forgive me if i reply in some detail to this amendment because i think it is important and i want to clarify the governments position on it <e> <s> i shall start with some general points about the application of clause to owners masters and managers and i shall then go on to the specific points made by the noble lord lord underhill in connection with the proposed new clause going in turn through each respect in which that clause differs from the existing clause <e>", "<cs> this is a substantial group of amendments and reflects the fact that the government my noble friend lord mottistone and the noble lords lord underhill and lord carmichael have been trying to achieve much the same result in respect of the two clauses namely to catch the manager when there is a manager <e> <s> nevertheless there are subtle differences between what in the governments view one should seek to achieve in these two clauses <e>", "<cs> i shall try to elaborate <e> <s> we are trying to say that both the owner and the manager are potentially liable for an offence <e> <s> as i have said there are many different sorts of chartering or managing arrangements in the shipping world <e> <s> it will therefore be up to the courts at the end of the day to apportion the blame between the owner and the manager <e> <s> the owner may not be blamed at all <e> <s> i should like to look again at what the noble lord lord underhill has said but that is my explanation at this stage <e>", "<cs> i touched on the deletion of subsection d when i dealt with a previous amendment <e> <s> as i explained i did not think it would have a catastrophic effect on the bill <e> <s> the government believe that subsection d is beneficial in that it caters for the unforeseen <e> <s> i do not believe either that it is as unpredictable in its effects as my noble friend has suggested <e> <s> it catches everything else that might render the ship unfit to go to sea without serious danger to human life <e> <s> that is no more sweeping in its effect than it should be <e> <s> i hope therefore that my noble friend will agree that the provision has a certain logic about it even though its detailed application may not be anticipated in advance <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may assist my noble and learned friend in the example that he gave of a ro-ro ship setting sail with its bow doors wide open <e> <s> i believe my noble and learned friend will find that that offence is much better and fully catered for when we come to the next two clauses <e>", "<cs> my noble friend raised this point at second reading and i have written to him at some length in response to the point he raised then <e> <s> i still have to say that we oppose the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount puts an interesting proposition to the committee and it is one that i should like to study <e> <s> however i do not propose to withdraw the clause at this stage <e> <s> the clause is closely based on section of the act <e> <s> in it was changed from the original in order to make it easy to enforce through inspections in ports <e> <s> i should like to study what the noble viscount said and write to him between now and the next stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord underhill for focusing the attention of the committee on the purpose of this clause by means of this series of amendments <e> <s> having said that i must add that the effect of these amendments if accepted by the committee would be to remove totally the main purpose of this clause <e> <s> it would make the general statutory duties of masters to see to the safety of their ships passengers and crews not stronger as is the intention of this clause but materially weaker than they are at present under section of the merchant shipping act <e>", "<cs> i am grateful first for the noble lord having notified me that the amendment was incorrectly printed on the marshalled list <e> <s> i have been able to take that into account in my reply <e> <s> i understand the concern of the noble lord that seafarers should not be disciplined by their employers if they have been acquitted of a criminal charge of failing to perform their duties in a proper manner <e> <s> however i am afraid i cannot accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have tried to cover that point in my reply <e> <s> i said first that it is quite possible that whereas a person did not do enough to get a conviction it could still be clear that some sort of industrial disciplinary action was justified <e> <s> secondly he also has recourse to the industrial tribunal which as i have already said is the body specifically set up to deal with this sort of matter <e>", "<cs> i have already explained fairly fully in the course of winding-up on the noble lords earlier amendment about the different treatment of workers in shipping and in other industries <e> <s> but as regards the merchant shipping health and safety general duties regulations these are concerned with occupational safety and provide only for summary proceedings <e> <s> they are typical issues of safety at work <e> <s> we should distinguish between occupational safety and safety at work and the way in which crews work so as not to endanger a ship or its passengers <e> <s> one should differentiate between those two things <e> <s> as to whether we could incorporate the regulations into the bill i do not propose to give the noble lord an answer at this moment <e> <s> i shall look into the matter and write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i should first say that in establishing this new marine accident investigation branch it has been our aim to model it as closely as possible upon the aviation accident investigation branch at farnborough <e> <s> that is well known in this country and enjoys a worldwide reputation <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws his amendment i shall reply to that point <e> <s> we always consult numast and the nus on any marine regulations which we put out <e> <s> that will certainly be the case with these regulations <e>", "<cs> i had based my speech on this amendment to refer to the transfer of cargo such as oil and dangerous cargoes <e> <s> i must admit that fish had not particularly entered my mind nor i suspect had it entered that of the noble lord lord carmichael at this stage <e> <s> however we share the <e>", "<cs> those amendments would represent a considerable extension of the scope of clause which is already intended to strengthen the powers currently available to take action against unfair competition from other countries <e> <s> with the committees permission i shall deal first with amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has brought the whole subject of the cost of light dues into this debate <e> <s> it remains the governments intention that they should not be a charge on the taxpayer and that the arrangements should remain as they are at present <e> <s> my noble friend lord mottistone recognised that in moving the amendment when he said that as we know the decca system was already paid for out of light dues and any possible extension to loran c will also be paid for in this way <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to noble lords on this amendment <e> <s> on the face of it the arguments are not unreasonable <e> <s> however they need to be set against the consideration that only seafarers have a statutory right to the payment of their wages within a given time limit <e> <s> the periods quoted in the bill are not average times that a seafarer will be kept waiting for his money nor are they targets to be aimed at <e> <s> they are statutory maxima after which heavy penalties can be imposed on his employer in the form of a punitive rate of interest to the seafarer <e> <s> a factory hand or any other employee may be paid shortly after leaving his employment but he has no such redress against his former employer if the payment is delayed for any reason and that was the point made so clearly by the noble lord lord mottistone <e>", "<cs> the repeal of section is proposed by the government in order to remove from the statute book a provision now rarely if ever invoked <e> <s> i understand that most of the disputes which are referred to officials under the section turn on differing interpretations of industrial agreements reached between employers and unions under the auspices of the national maritime board <e> <s> the government are not party to these agreements and nor would they be party to any agreements outside unions <e> <s> i gather that the officers in question not i think surprisingly usually exercise their right under the section to decline to decide the dispute <e>", "<cs> i have listened with interest to the comments made on this amendment <e> <s> i should like if i may to comment separately on the two repeals in section of the act contained in the amendment <e> <s> the effect of the repeal in section would be to apply section of the conspiracy and protection of property act to seamen <e> <s> this makes it an offence for a person maliciously or wilfully to break a contract of service knowing or having reason to believe that the breach might endanger human life cause serious injury or damage valuable property <e> <s> the remainder of the act except for section was extended to seamen under the merchant shipping act <e> <s> but a conscious decision was taken at the time to make an exception in the case of section <e> <s> the reason for this was that other provisions in the act namely section on misconduct endangering ships made alternative arrangements more appropriate to the conditions of service of seafarers for dealing with the case of a seaman who as a result of a breach or neglect of duty endangers his ship or the life of anyone on board his ship <e>", "<cs> our proposal to amend section of the merchant shipping act is to simplify the task of the wreck commissioner or sheriff in assessing costs at a formal investigation <e> <s> he will <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that there is a serious problem <e> <s> it is estimated that it will cost london underground three-quarters of a million pounds in the current year <e> <s> as regards the police the number of british transport police on the underground has been increased by per cent <e> <s> in the past year from to officers <e> <s> therefore the problem is taken very seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords that would be a matter for the prosecuting authorities or the magistrates <e> <s> however i certainly think that it would be a very good idea <e>", "<cs> my lords executing graffiti is a crime whatever way one looks at it <e> <s> i have not seen the tyne and wear scheme but i shall certainly look into that <e> <s> the governments programme has started with a pilot project in one <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not heard that that is the case <e> <s> i am not certain that we should do anything to encourage graffiti whether or not by providing places in which to do it <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to look into those questions as they do not specifically relate to the london underground <e> <s> it is certainly a matter for the magistrates but i shall draw the attention of my right honourable friend to the noble lords remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall indeed <e> <s> this is a serious and a dangerous problem <e> <s> not very long ago a young boy of only was making graffiti when he was hit by a train and killed <e> <s> this matter should be taken seriously it is not a joke <e> <s> i hope that that will soon be seen to be the case <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble countess makes a very good point <e> <s> i understand that most of the offences are committed by young people <e> <s> at the moment there is a particular cult mainly composed of teenagers who take part in this crime <e> <s> as i have already said the other day there was a <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft merchant shipping passenger ship construction amendment no <e> <s> regulations that were laid before the house on th november be approved <e>",

your lordships over a period of time covering the <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my understanding that it would only apply on passenger services <e> <s> if the vessel came here on a passenger service it would apply but if it came here for another reason such as was outlined by the noble lord lord greenway then it would not <e>", "<cs> my lords i can say that it applies on all passenger services <e> <s> it applies also to irregular services but not if the ship is used for <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> in our invisible earnings were the largest in the world with a surplus of billion in the year annualised for the first half of <e> <s> the prospects are equally good in the performance of invisible earnings again this year <e> <s> the surplus is expected to rise further to billion in <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord puts down a question for written answer to that effect i shall do my best to find the answer <e> <s> at the moment i cannot say whether those figures are available <e>", "<cs> my lords a good deal of money has been invested in the rehabilitation of our industries <e> <s> investment in manufacturing industry is currently at a very high level <e> <s> the overseas assets now held by citizens of the united kingdom are extremely valuable and they will be very useful in the years to come <e>", "<cs> my lords the yield of billion annualised on the first half of is expected to rise to billion <e> <s> i do not believe that is a bad return on investments compared with what can be obtained in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is right <e> <s> in my answers i have tried to imply the importance that we attach to these assets <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures that i have been giving are net assets <e> <s> that is overseas assets with overseas liabilities deducted <e> <s> i am not sure whether i have available the two figures which make up the net assets which i have given <e>", "<cs> my lords i now have the figures <e> <s> the gross overseas assets held by the united kingdom were billion <e> <s> gross liabilities amount to billion <e> <s> that answers the question from the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have no plans to end all or part of duty-free trading <e> <s> my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer made clear that discussions within the economic and finance <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is correct <e> <s> as a fiscal measure it will require unanimity among ministers <e>", "<cs> my lords i can do little more than refer the noble lord to what i said in my original answer <e> <s> my right honourable friend made clear that discussions within the council of the communities were based on its acceptance of the continuing existence of duty and tax free facilities as long as fiscal frontiers remain within the european community <e>", "<cs> my lords that will be correct provided there is fiscal harmonisation at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is perhaps referring to the commissions suggestions to end the sale of duty-free tobacco as part of its initiative for reducing the incidence of cancer <e> <s> no formal proposals have yet been made <e> <s> although action against cancer is being handled by health ministers finance ministers will be dealing with detailed tax proposals <e> <s> the wider economic implications are being kept in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i can add little to what i have said <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will now repeat the answer to a private notice question in the form of a statement currently being delivered by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport in another place <e> <s> it is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords the question asked for a statement on the governments policy in the light of the latest developments in the negotiations between bcal and sas <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall attempt to deal with the questions asked by the noble lord lord underhill and the noble baroness lady burton of coventry <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill asked why my noble friend the secretary of state for trade and industry had decided not to refer the merger to the mmc <e> <s> my noble friend considered that the proposal raised no competition or other public interest issues which merited investigation by the mmc <e> <s> in reaching his decision he took into account all the relevant factors including the powers available to my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport to decide whether to direct the revocation of an airlines licences in the circumstances prescribed in the civil aviation act <e>", "<cs> my lords not at all <e> <s> if sas comes back with proposals which do not attract <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> i said that my noble friend took into account the powers available to my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport which are especially important in this case <e> <s> that was one of the reasons he decided not to refer the merger to the mmc <e> <s> in my opinion another important reason is to try to end the uncertainty currently hanging over bcal <e> <s> a further reference to the mmc would take another three months <e>", "<cs> my lords the government would certainly not wish to get involved with trying to persuade the noble lord lord king to raise his offer for british caledonian <e> <s> the reason my right honourable friend wrote to the chairman of british caledonian in the terms that he did was largely because of the tremendous difficulties which we would have bilaterally with other countries if bcal was not a british airline <e> <s> my noble friend will be aware that all route licensing is done on a bilateral basis between this country and others <e> <s> even if we decided ourselves that bcal was a british airline other countries might well decide that it was not and try to reopen negotiations <e> <s> they might even stop the airline flying in <e>", "<cs> my lords we have grave apprehensions under the terms proposed originally by sas for a per cent <e> <s> shareholding in bcal <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the whole point of what i have been trying to say <e> <s> under the terms of the original possible offer by sas for bcal it was the opinion of the civil aviation authority which is the statutory body concerned with this matter that control would no longer be in british hands and it would therefore be regarded as a foreign airline <e>", "<cs> my lords in one of her earlier supplementaries the noble baroness said that it should be the shareholders of bcal who decide and not the house <e> <s> i do not know whether there would be any value in a debate on this subject at the moment <e> <s> as i have said if the house requires further information on the subject a copy of the letter which my right honourable friend wrote to the chairman of british caledonian airways has been placed in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously my noble friend the leader of the house heard the request of the noble baroness for a debate <e> <s> as one usually says that is a matter for the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords we are having one <e>", "<cs> my lords i meant that i am trying to answer all the questions as best i can at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords ministers will discuss this with the director general of fair trading <e> <s> i would not wish to anticipate the outcome of those discussions now but it will be one of the items on the agenda <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that information on civil remedies is not available to me at the moment <e> <s> perhaps i may look into that matter and write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords these discussions result from a symposium held in march of this year which included representatives from local authorities and the motor trades organisations <e> <s> they resolved to make a joint approach to government to see what could be done <e> <s> the meeting next week is the result of those discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that we can go quite so far as that with every car involved in an accident <e> <s> we are aware of the public concern about cars which have been written off by their insurance companies <e> <s> that is something which a working party of police insurers and the dvlc is considering <e> <s> we hope that it will report carefully and very soon <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been suggested that mileages should be notified to the dvlc on application for a road fund licence and on the transfer of vehicles <e> <s> it has also been suggested that a central record of mileages should be kept <e> <s> this would be expensive to administer but we are considering it <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an interesting suggestion from the noble lady and it is one which i shall draw to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly would not have agreed to the package if we did not believe that it was worth having <e> <s> in fact it is based largely on the uk initiative and took shape during our presidency last year <e> <s> it will allow airlines to compete over the level of discount fares and to introduce new cheap fares <e> <s> it relaxes the strict capacity-sharing rule where it still exists allowing airlines to operate more flights without being limited to matching the number flown by foreign airlines <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i can assure your lordships that all member states take their responsibilities for air safety extremely seriously <e> <s> questions of safety and congestion are kept under constant review <e> <s> however there is nothing in the new package that in any way weakens our present stringent safety standards and procedures or our determination to enforce them <e> <s> the airports policy white paper in took into account effects of liberalisation <e> <s> as i said in an earlier answer there is great potential for development of regional airports in this package <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly <e> <s> copies of the instruments as adopted will be deposited in the library as soon as they are available from the commission <e> <s> however i should also be happy to provide a summary of the effects of the package in the form of a written answer if the noble baroness puts down a question <e>", "<cs> my lords the city of westminster as the highway authority is responsible for roadworks on the roads concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my orginal answer this is a matter for westminster city council <e> <s> however noble lords will be aware that there are major developments at piccadilly circus at the moment involving lrt and westminster city council and also various commercial developments <e> <s> these will be continuing for a little longer <e> <s> in the meantime i am sure that westminster city council will do what it can to alleviate the traffic problems <e>", "<cs> my lords that is rather a different question <e> <s> i am aware that the committee was set up under the recommendations of the horne report <e> <s> but i am not briefed about its present progress <e> <s> perhaps i can find out and write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that westminster city council will read what has been said this afternoon in your lordships house <e> <s> perhaps it will be able to act on it <e>", "<cs> my lords i too hope that the holes will be repaired <e> <s> as i said earlier it is a major development at piccadilly circus which obviously is taking time <e> <s> the government give ample allowance to local authorities for road repairs <e>", "<cs> my lords yes certainly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i do not know the answer to that <e> <s> i shall have to write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to hear the experience of the noble viscount but this is very much a matter for local councils not for the government <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the royal mint has already published a pamphlet <e>", "<cs> my lords the government consulted widely on these plans <e> <s> they have already commissioned research by nottingham university <e> <s> we have consulted interested parties such as the blind industry retailers banks manufacturers of coin vending machines and the <e>", "<cs> my lords the coin was issued as a commemorative coin <e> <s> there are no plans to bring it into general circulation <e> <s> on the other hand there may be further occasions for commemorative coins <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said that is a matter for the scottish banks <e> <s> we should certainly not attempt to influence their decision to go on issuing pound notes <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope it will be before christmas but i do not want to commit myself completely to that <e> <s> as i have said we consulted not only the banks but a great many other interested parties and the general public <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord underhill for his welcome to the order <e> <s> the definition of damage to property is not in the regulations <e> <s> the noble lord has referred to what the department has already said on this matter <e> <s> there is not a lot i can add to that <e> <s> in the circumstances we have little choice but to rely on the common sense definition which insurers currently employ which embraces damage to material property and anything which flows from such damage such as claims for consequential losses <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that there are queues at certain times of day on certain sections of the m <e> <s> it is our proposal that there should be four service stations at the four cardinal points of the motorway <e> <s> as to putting notices on the exit junctions pointing the way to the nearest service station i am not quite sure whether that would be possible <e> <s> i shall look into it and let my noble friend know <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that it is done on certain other main roads including trunk roads <e> <s> i shall have to look into the case of the motorway and write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i spoke at some length to a similar amendment which the noble lord lord carmichael proposed in committee and i shall now summarise the arguments briefly <e> <s> subsection of clause deals with the case where a ship is entitled to be registered it meets the requirements set out in clauses and but the secretary of state nevertheless directs that the ship should not be registered <e> <s> that power in effect a power to override the normal eligibility requirements is a new power and has no counterpart in the act <e> <s> as the bill is drafted it may be used on very clear and specific grounds the condition of the ship insofar as is relevant to its safety or to any risk of pollution and the safety health and welfare of persons employed on board <e>", "<cs> my lords i have sympathy with the thought underlying the amendments <e> <s> as i said in committee the government have accepted the view of the general council of british shipping that one month would be too short a period of validity for provisional certificates and our view remains that three months validity would be reasonable <e> <s> however the amendments of the noble lord lord underhill raise the important question of what evidence as to the condition of a ship and its safety might be required in connection with provisional certificates <e> <s> i believe that we should ask for some evidence in this area <e> <s> the noble lords amendments suggest one option which was indeed referred to in my departments consultative document <e> <s> there may be others worth looking at <e> <s> so i have asked my department to consult with the general council of british shipping about what evidence it would be sensible to require in the special circumstances of provisional registration <e>", "<cs> my lords i can indeed understand the concern that has prompted the noble lord lord underhill to table this amendment but i hope that i shall be able to assure him that his concerns will be met in the way we propose to administer the scheme for providing assistance with training and that this amendment is unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords these two amendments draw the attention of the house to the basic form of this clause and pose the question of why the offence under this clause is cast in terms simply of being the owner or master of an unfit ship that is in port rather than as proposed in this pair of amendments of intending to take it to sea <e> <s> that was a point raised at committee stage by the noble viscount lord simon and as has been said i have now written to him about it <e> <s> i think it will be helpful if in replying to the noble lord lord underhill and other noble lords i set out the position for the benefit of the house as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may say that the master should satisfy himself that the ship is fit to go to sea <e> <s> if the ship has the required certificates issued by the department and if the ship has been well maintained and so on he should have no difficulty in doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord mottistone said these amendments are indeed very similar in effect to the new clause which the noble lord lord underhill moved in committee <e> <s> if i recall correctly that was defeated and the committee came down overwhelmingly in favour of keeping the responsibilities of the master as in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount lord simon is not in a minority of one <e> <s> because too wish paragraph d to remain in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i think that i have responded to that point <e> <s> we believe that this is the best way of achieving what we want <e> <s> if my noble friend reads with care the explanation that i have given he may be persuaded that we are right <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for moving the amendment <e> <s> we recognise that the provisions made in respect of the manager by government amendment at committee stage are not yet wholly satisfactory and we have been trying to develop a solution with the assistance of parliamentary counsel as quickly as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords the four lines which it is proposed by this amendment to delete have in fact been a common feature of shipping legislation for many years <e> <s> the house may be interested to know that the merchant shipping act which introduced the possibility of detention of of foreign ships that were unfit when in british ports included a specific saving for ships that were coming into our ports under stress of weather etc <e> <s> more recently such a provision is incorporated in the safety of life at sea conventions such as that one may not enforce the internationally agreed solas standards upon ships that are in ones ports for such reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments would as the noble lord lord underhill has explained delete the new subsection from this clause <e> <s> in committee i explained the reason behind this important subsection but i think it is important that i should now do so for the benefit of the house as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave what i said was not on summary conviction <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an interesting amendment and contains much with which the government agree <e> <s> the government fully accept that a sloppy and inefficient shipowner or ships manager can make it very difficult for a master to carry out his duties safely <e> <s> there are however now a range of defences open to the master under subsection and the government do not believe that failure of the owner would make the master unfairly guilty of an offence <e> <s> certainly a bad manager makes a captains job more demanding but if he nevertheless makes every effort to carry out his duties safely he has a valid defence under subsection b <e> <s> and indeed the proposed amendment does not in fact seek to create a new defence <e>", "<cs> my lords subject to advice which i may be able to relay to the noble viscount in due course for the moment i shall have to rest on connected purposes in the long title <e>", "<cs> my lords during committee i said that the government had some sympathy with the case for repealing this provision and undertook to look carefully at the arguments <e> <s> in the light of further consideration i am satisfied that there is a good case for repeal <e> <s> noble lords will recall that i sketched out the background to the provisions of section in some detail during committee <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to say that i made it pretty clear at committee stage that we were going to look very carefully at the arguments and if appropriate would bring forward an amendment on report <e> <s> we did not have time to bring forward an amendment on report <e> <s> however my noble friend put down the same amendment as he put down at committee stage and therefore with that amendment there i have to say now that we are going to accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords i take issue with the noble lords suggestion that lrt is not operating efficiently at the moment <e> <s> it is for lrt not the government to determine the staffing levels required to operate services both safely and efficiently <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said it is for lrt and not the government to determine staffing levels <e> <s> it is essential that london transport both on the buses and the underground should operate safely and efficiently and give good value for money <e> <s> i should have thought that the fact that a record number of people travelled on the underground last year showed that they were providing a good service <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to say that i am no more able to accept the amendment now than i was at either committee or report stage <e> <s> i am slightly surprised that it should come up for the third time today <e> <s> nothing that has been said has persuaded me that it would be right to make this change to our system of registration <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the national interest is not referred to in the bill <e> <s> i mentioned the national economy when giving a comparison with the situation in greece and i also mentioned one or two other countries <e> <s> in greece there is a right to refuse registration which is deemed to be against the interest of the national economy <e>", "<cs> my lords the matter raised by the noble lord lord underhill in this amendment is indeed a familiar and serious one <e> <s> it arises in a number of guises <e> <s> i can give a number of examples but perhaps the most notable at the moment is the publicity given recently to the reductions in crew ratios on cross-channel ferries <e> <s> a second scenario is that of a deep-sea ship which is in port for a fairly short period say less than a day and during most of that time crew members are supervising the loading and perhaps also maintenance and minor repairs to the ship <e> <s> the ship then puts to sea with the efficiency of the crew possibly dangerously impaired <e>", "<cs> my lords when i spoke in committee in response to a new clause proposed by the noble lords lord underhill and lord carmichael <e> <s> i stated perhaps rashly that the total deletion of these words would not emasculate the merchant shipping bill <e> <s> i should have thought that that was undeniable <e> <s> but as has been said it is not quite the same as saying that i believe the bill would be just as good with or without the words in subsection d <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give a specific example of another act <e> <s> i said with the leave of the house that it was rather unusual when defining a criminal offence to elaborate that offence with examples as we do in subsection a to c <e> <s> subsection d is implied by subsection <e> <s> if subsection is omitted anything included in subsection d would certainly be covered <e> <s> subsection is entirely conventional with other acts <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend and your lordships that the aim of the measures that we have had to bring in since the herald of free enterprise disaster whether included in this bill or in any of the regulations that we are bringing through at the moment has not been to protect the department <e> <s> i hope that there will not be another disaster of that sort <e> <s> it is to protect the travelling public <e>", "<cs> my lords the government agree with what my noble friend lord mottistone has said <e> <s> i am afraid i cannot support this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have two difficulties with these proposals one is practical and the other is a matter of principle <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to look at the matter in more detail and write to the noble lord <e> <s> i believe that the recommendation concentrated on unusual and special laws rather than on the generality of shipping laws <e> <s> i should like to write to the noble lord giving further details <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment conveys a very important idea and one that the government wholeheartedly accept namely that important incidents that could if repeated lead to accidents in the future may not be reported if the person in a position to report them is afraid of disciplinary action or even prosecution based upon the information in his report <e>", "<cs> my lords the regulations of which i am talking are under clause of this bill and therefore cannot come forward until the bill has passed through another place but i hope that they will not be unduly delayed <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e> <s> i hope your lordships will agree that we can look back over the past two months work on this bill with some satisfaction <e> <s> we have had four sessions of serious informed debate as a result of which the bill will leave this house a better bill in a number of important respects <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that there is important business to follow but perhaps i may briefly thank the noble lord lord underhill and lord greenway and my noble friends lord campbell of croy lord mottistone and lord gray of contin for the kind words they have used about my handling of the passage of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that there are no grounds for complacency <e> <s> one needs to take the figures for random breath tests which have so far been given with a certain amount of caution because we have not yet had the figures for the overall number of tests <e> <s> they will not be available for a little while <e> <s> we shall have to wait a little to obtain the percentage of positive breath tests <e>", "<cs> my lords we keep closely in touch with the united states canada and australia <e> <s> despite some dramatic changes in those countries they are no more successful overall in containing the problem than we are <e>", "<cs> my lords enforcement is a matter for the police <e> <s> their efforts reflect societys demands <e> <s> they take their responsibilities seriously every day not just in the holiday season <e> <s> last year there were convictions for drink-driving <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord is correct <e> <s> the question is whether police resources are better spent in random breath testing or in using their already extensive powers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that when the figures are eventually available from the police forces a good deal of publicity will be given to them <e> <s> we are encouraged by the amount of attention that the media are now giving to this subject not through paid publicity but through editorial coverage <e> <s> that is encouraging <e>", "<cs> my lords this question is related to drink-driving and there is no doubt that the effect of drink on peoples ability to drive however well they may think they drive is fairly dramatic <e>", "<cs> my lords our campaign nowadays is targeted to three phases throughout the year july october and december <e> <s> we plan to continue that in the coming year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that the capital gains tax concession is applicable to primary residences <e> <s> however i am not aware of any proposals to extend it to inheritance tax <e> <s> of people who die each year in the united kingdom only some per cent <e> <s> of estates are liable to inheritance tax and as regards estates above the threshold around only a quarter of the value on average lies in a house <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to my noble friends supplementary question i said that only some per cent <e> <s> of estates are liable to inheritance tax <e> <s> as regards any funds which are as the noble lord put it available at the next budget <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount is quite correct <e> <s> the inheritance tax is payable only on the death of the last surviving spouse <e> <s> i should say that if the suggestion made in my noble friends question was carried through and there was no inheritance tax on the first or principal home it would have a fairly marked impact on the house market <e> <s> presumably those who thought that they were going to die would immediately buy the most expensive house that they could find in order to exempt themselves from inheritance tax <e>", "<cs> my lords we are sympathetic <e> <s> beneficiaries who retain the home may pay tax in instalments over years <e> <s> that would probably not be very much different from what they might have to pay on normal mortgage repayments <e> <s> therefore with luck they should not be turned out of the family home <e>", "<cs> my lords i am saying that if the suggestion made by my noble friend were carried forward it would be a fairly obvious tax dodge for people to attempt <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may reply to my noble friends first point about breaking up the company into smaller units <e> <s> as i said in my original answer the company is itself the result of a division into four parts of the london country company <e> <s> the nbc and our advisers have made it clear that further division would lead to weak companies which would harm competition <e> <s> on my noble friends second point about splitting the company between the property and the bus operation we believe that nbc has advertised the sale of the company on that basis and it believes that that reduces the risk of asset stripping by a possible property developer who might want to buy the bus company just to close it <e> <s> it makes it possible for people committed to buses to buy the bus company <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not want to comment on that report apropos of this particular question which deals with the county of surrey <e> <s> however the county of surrey saved million of its budget on subsidised services for last year <e> <s> there has been plenty of innovation in the <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord wishes to ask me a question about newcastle-upon-tyne i shall do my best to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords the group exemptions to which the noble baroness refers will be granted under article of the treaty of rome <e> <s> they do not produce the scope for commission action because they will apply only to agreements which meet the conditions for exemptions laid down in the treaty <e> <s> the exemptions which are only transitional will expire on st january <e>", "<cs> my lords details of the exemptions are listed in article of the regulations a copy of which has been placed in the library of the house <e> <s> therefore the noble baroness and any other noble lord will be able to see them <e> <s> the council thought it right that the exemptions should be reviewed in three years in the light of the changed circumstances which may then exist <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness tables a written question of course i shall answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer that question at the moment because it is for the presidency to table the agenda for the march council and that has not yet been done <e> <s> it must be done days in advance of the meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords all goods vehicles including foreign registered vehicles entering the ports and travelling on the roads in britain are liable to be stopped and checked by the departments traffic examiners or the police to see that they comply with our legal requirements for vehicle dimensions and weights <e> <s> local authority trading standards officers also make regular use of the departments weighbridge sites <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously we do not check every vehicle but we try to check a number <e> <s> we have an increasing programme of checks to be made <e> <s> last year foreign registered vehicles were weighed <e> <s> in the coming year we propose to raise that figure to at least <e> <s> over the next few <e>", "<cs> my lords of the per cent <e> <s> of vehicles weighed many are regular visitors and therefore the chances of any one vehicle being caught is heightened <e> <s> as regards weighing at ports as part of ferry safety operations we are required to weigh lorries which are boarding ferries <e> <s> we are also in consultation with european countries to ascertain whether they will make similar arrangements on the continent <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not in line with europe <e> <s> the maximum weight on the continent is tonnes at present we have a temporary derogation to a limit of tonnes <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the figures for axle weights i was giving the figure for maximum weights <e>", "<cs> my lords more weighbridges are being planned at ports for weighing lorries which leave the ferries <e> <s> we are also examining methods of increasing the number of lorries weighed by using new technology and faster weighing equipment <e> <s> consultations are under way with a view to mounting a pilot project at five selected ports to test a range of options for increasing the number of

country in respect of axle weights i have only those figures for total weight limits <e> <s> axle weights are indeed important as regards roads and bridges <e>", "<cs> my lords if foreigners are caught in this country they are prohibited from further movement until their load has been adjusted <e> <s> in some cases instant courts have been convened to coincide with foreign vehicle checks and

improve our resources for weighing the vehicles and to increase the number of checks and weighbridges <e>", "<cs> my lords our derogation from the -tonne limit is temporary but we have said that we cannot accept any increase in the total weight or axle weight until our roads and bridges have been surveyed and strengthened where necessary <e> <s> that will inevitably take many years to complete and no early increase in lorry weights is contemplated <e> <s> in any case any increase could not be brought into effect without the approval of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords about per cent <e> <s>

commission and the airline concerned <e> <s> it is not a matter for ministers <e> <s> i cannot answer for the commission in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i have tried to explain that this is a

excess <e> <s> we are encouraged by the assurances given by japan but we are not complacent that is why we are pressing to ensure that action is as full and as early as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall both monitor the results of this case but it was the ec who mounted the successful gatt case against japan <e> <s> that is not to say that the government do not take the matter extremely seriously as well <e> <s> my right honourable and learned friend the foreign secretary who visited japan recently received an assurance from the japanese foreign minister that details of the proposed reforms would he available later this year <e>", "<cs> my lords we all appreciate that noisy motorcycles are a great problem <e> <s> concerning the use of noise meters at roadsides the police have found that procedure difficult to operate because of the problems of finding suitable test sites and of excluding noise from other sources <e> <s> i can assure the house that there are prosecutions for motorcycle noise offences and that the police prosecute when they can <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord <e> <s> it is possible that the noise problem is even worse in rural areas than in urban areas where there are other background noises <e> <s> however we believe that the various measures concerning the sale of replacement silencers and making sure that they are up to scratch together with the regulations for new motorcycles will go some way towards alleviating the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords that is quite correct <e> <s> the police do not have the resources to do absolutely everything that they might like to do <e> <s> however i can assure the house that exhausts are checked in mot tests and a motorcycle can fail the test if one is leaking or insecurely mounted <e> <s> motorcycles will also have to have silencers which conform with the regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords it is an offence to tamper with an exhaust pipe so that it makes more noise than it should <e> <s> i understand that there have been prosecutions involving such actions <e> <s> the new british standard replacement silencers should be made tamper-proof if possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend that it will be sooner than that <e>", "<cs> my lords it is an offence to ride a motorcycle which causes excessive noise or to ride in such a way as to cause excessive noise which could have been avoided with reasonable care on the part of the driver <e> <s> that covers the point which my noble friend makes <e> <s> on the other hand i should think that it would be

crossing in the meantime and institute further traffic management measures if necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand not <e> <s> that is a separate project <e>", "<cs> my lords we have made no decision yet on whether this second crossing should be tolled or not <e> <s> however on tolled crossings we believe that there are more pressing demands on resources than abolishing tolls and that the

<s> one of the measures in the transport act was an amendment to the post offices act which allowed the sale of tickets at post offices <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that there is any question of tickets not being available for sale at stations it is a question of where else tickets might be offered for sale if that is convenient for passengers <e> <s> i should point out that the objective set to british rail last summer by my honourable friend the minister of state for transport was that there should be maximum queueing time at ticket offices of three minutes during off-peak periods and five minutes during peak periods <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked a number of questions <e> <s> as far as i know the matter relating to commission paid by br to the travel agents was settled between the travel agents and british rail <e> <s> however whether it was settled to the satisfaction of the travel agents i do not know <e> <s> in any case tickets are still available for

possible to have some information on that <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said there will be a new forecast in three weeks for the current account deficit at the time of the budget <e> <s> however as regards import figures recent figures for import volumes have been very erratic <e> <s> it is not surprising that imports are growing relatively strongly given the rapid growth in united kingdom domestic demand and activity <e> <s> the rise in imports is not confined to consumer goods <e> <s> rising imports of materials semi-manufactures intermediate and capital goods reflect rising output

per cent <e> <s> as a percentage of gross domestic product is not that great particularly when compared with figures from for example the united states germany and japan where trade balances are some

produce some figures and perhaps write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said i do not have those figures with me <e> <s> however in my earlier reply i did not concentrate solely on the

with all the figures which might conceivably be <e>", "<cs> my lords i am by no means complacent about the figures <e> <s> i attempted to point out some of the good points about the figures such as the large increase in exports of manufactures <e> <s> we have held our share in manufacturing industry in world terms since compared with many decades of decline before that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness for her kind words at the beginning of her statement <e> <s> i have to say however that the presidency of the permanent commission is something which comes up in turn among all the member states so the appointment is not very much to my own personal credit <e> <s> regarding pressure and environmental groups in airport development it is a fact of life that airport developments have environmental implications and the government have to take those into account <e> <s> it is also true to say that in arriving at decisions about airport development we have to have regard to the wider national interest <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord endorses the white paper recommendations on capacity in the south-east which take into account the development of stansted <e> <s> the first stage would increase capacity to million passengers and the second stage to million <e> <s> it does not go beyond that at the moment but there is a possibility that capacity could go up to million if a second terminal is built <e> <s> that would of course require planning permission <e> <s> there is also a good deal of capacity at regional airports <e> <s> the government have given a great deal of encouragement to the development of regional <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i think that it is too late to go back to those plans <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we take into account the needs of general aviation <e> <s> however we feel that at major airports such as gatwick and heathrow the commercial services must take priority and may eventually force out business in general aviation from those airports <e> <s> we have encouraged the development of a series of airports around london in order to cope with that and i hope that in conjuction with the ministry of defence there will shortly be some development at northolt <e>", "<cs> my lords we are the first to recognise the immense achievement of civil aviation in this country and the contribution that it makes to our economy <e> <s> as regards the provision of extra capacity the civil aviation authority has a statutory duty under the civil aviation act to make recommendations <e> <s> up to now it certainly has not done so <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i answered that question to some extent when i gave the figures for investment in regional airports <e> <s> the noble earl may be aware that traffic at manchester grew by over a quarter last year and that more or less the same increase was seen at glasgow and at birmingham <e> <s> there are therefore great opportunities for those regional airports <e>", "<cs> my lords airport charges are a matter for the operator <e> <s> the government would not attempt to influence the operators of those airports about how much they charge <e> <s> in the case of prestwick the british airports authority will be reviewing the situation at that airport next year <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not noticed the airport charges at manchester though i suppose that i ought to be quite careful about what i say as regards the mmc report having detracted from the growth of that airport <e> <s> as i said a few minutes ago it is growing tremendously fast <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> there is indeed a danger that if we try to force people to use airports to which they do not wish to go we may lose traffic to schiphol paris and frankfurt <e> <s> the government do not seek to force people to fly to places to which they do not wish to go <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the figures with me at the moment but many million people every year want to go to london <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier there has been a very large growth recently particularly at glasgow <e> <s> as we all know prestwick has its difficulties but it offers trans-atlantic services <e> <s> there is nothing to stop somebody starting a service to scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords wheel-clamping is being extended to further parts of central london <e> <s> since wheel-clamping was introduced it has reduced illegal parking on yellow lines by per cent <e> <s> and in residents bays by one third <e> <s> it has reduced journey times by between and per cent <e> <s> providing an estimated saving of between million and million a year <e> <s> therefore i believe that in that direction wheel-clamping has been a success <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of the noble lords interest in the future of the victoria coach station <e> <s> the situation has been going on for some time now <e> <s> i am not entirely sure what stage we have reached at the moment but perhaps i can write to the noble lord with the latest information <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously clamping must be done very carefully and vehicles which are an obstruction to traffic should not be <e>", "<cs> my lords not at all <e> <s> investment by london regional transport will be a record million this year and we propose to authorise an increased expenditure of million a day for the next year <e> <s> therefore we have not neglected investment by london regional transport which is carrying record numbers of people at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords very large vehicles are banned at certain times of the day from certain parts of central london <e> <s> i believe this is a question for the local highway authorities which are responsible for that <e>", "<cs> my lords i should hate to disagree with the noble lord but since the glc disappeared expenditure has risen quite sharply as regards both central government and major borough schemes <e> <s> the department has approved major borough schemes worth about million in supplementary grant for the coming year <e>", "<cs> my lords traffic wardens operate under the auspices of the police

"<cs> my lords i think that on the whole pavements should be reserved for pedestrians and other users such as people in wheelchairs with prams and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that in certain areas where there is a large area of pavement it might be possible to use some of the space <e> <s> i have seen one such area near where i live <e> <s> however in general terms pavements must be reserved for pedestrians <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend makes an important point but with the exception of trunk roads within central london that is a question for the local highway authorities and not for the government <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not a question of reintroducing it <e> <s> towing away occurs to a considerable extent <e> <s> clamping and towing away are complementary measures <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend is seeking an order through the county court for vacant possession of the highway land <e> <s> he hopes to obtain a hearing early in march and in the event of an order being granted the land could be vacated within a few weeks <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of my noble friends concern but i can reassure him that the order we seek at present will be under order of the county court rules <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport is satisfied that the provisions of the zebra pedestrian crossings regulations supported by advice on the design of pedestrian crossings published by the department are adequate for safety during the hours of darkness <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that there is a role for both the pelican-type crossings and the zebra crossings <e> <s> in the departments advice notes which are sent out to local highway authorities we <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord makes an interesting suggestion <e> <s> i am not at present aware of who is responsible for reporting such breakages to the local highway authority responsible for replacing them <e> <s> indeed i hope that the police who are on patrol do report such breakages <e> <s> however i will draw the noble lords remarks to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord makes an interesting suggestion but it is a matter for people to decide for themselves <e> <s> nevertheless i should say that the incidence of accidents on pedestrian crossings both during the day and at night is not that high though i do not wish to be complacent <e> <s> however it would indeed be useful if people wore more visible clothing <e>", "<cs> my lords i have always understood that parking on the zig-zag lines next to a pedestrian crossing is practically a capital offence <e> <s> i hope that other road users also take that into account <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is right <e> <s> that is one of the aspects included in our guidance notes for highway authorities when they decide between pelican or zebra crossings <e> <s> pelican crossings are of course more expensive to install and are not necessary everywhere but they do have an important role to play <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all local authorities try to keep their street lights operating at the correct times <e> <s> many are now automatically controlled and however much we advance in technology we cannot avoid the occasional breakdown <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that am not aware of the instance to which the noble lord draws my attention <e> <s> what i can be fairly sure of is that it is not a matter for the government it is a matter for the local highway authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the speech which my right honourable friend made <e> <s> it is certainly true that local authorities have significantly under-spent on the provision allowed for them for road maintenance <e> <s> we increased provision by per cent <e> <s> in and by a further per cent <e> <s> in <e> <s> in the year which is now coming to an end local authorities under-spent by million on road maintenance <e> <s> it is for the authorities to adjust their spending priorities to give road maintenance the priority which we believe it deserves <e>", "<cs> my lords if local authorities feel that they are not getting sufficient provision for other services that is something which i have no doubt they will take up with the relevant authorities <e> <s> we are all aware that local roads need maintenance but we cannot accept that local authorities should choose to spend from that budget what they were allocated for other things <e>", "<cs> my lords there have been proposals put forward to make it easier for highway authorities to close little-used but expensive-to-maintain roads <e> <s> a consultation paper was issued in and a wide spectrum of responses was received <e> <s> these have been carefully considered <e> <s> it is hoped to make an announcement of the governments intentions in parliament shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords we very much hope that uk airlines will be able to respond to the ec directive by introducing lower and more flexible cost-related fares <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards whether it might be referred to arbitration i cannot say anything definite until the proposals have been filed <e> <s> naturally i hope that there will not be any disagreement because both governments must observe the rules for approval in the fares directive <e> <s> if arbitration is necessary the longest it could take to reach a decision is normally three months from the date when the fares were first filed <e>", "<cs> my lords as strasbourg is within the ec exactly the same criteria would apply if an airline applied for cheaper flights to strasbourg it would be covered by the same directive as the one which is in question today <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to correct the noble lord <e> <s> the fare is not yet available on the paris route <e> <s> as regards domestic fares there is competition on the london to edinburgh london to glasgow routes <e> <s> there are two airlines competing from heathrow and there is also competition from gatwick <e> <s> there is the possibility of low air fares upon those routes <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that practice is not actually happening at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords the conditions for people employed within the airlines must be for the management of the airlines concerned <e> <s> the criteria for deciding on the new fares are set down in article of the directive <e> <s> i touched upon two of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that your lordships will agree with my noble friend <e> <s> the government have been working very hard indeed over the past few years in order to achieve the first stage of this ec package <e> <s> i emphasise that it is only the first stage <e> <s> we hope to make further progress by and even more progress by <e> <s> the package we have achieved in europe is not as liberal as we should have liked and it is not as liberal as we have achieved after bilateral negotiations elsewhere <e> <s> however it is a first step <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall indeed be happy to follow my noble friends suggestion and congratulate the noble baroness on her birthday of yesterday <e> <s> i know that she has been very interested in the subject of aviation for many years <e> <s> perhaps it would not be rude of me to say that her birthday more or less coincides with the anniversary of powered flight <e>", "<cs> my lords there will be a new forecast for this current year for which we still await the figures for two months <e> <s> it will be made in the budget next tuesday so there is not much more that i can say at this point <e>", "<cs> my lords i obviously do not accept what the noble lord says <e> <s> a low public sector borrowing requirement even a negative public sector borrowing requirement is a sign that the economy is healthy and growing and that public finances are firmly under control <e> <s> this years public sector borrowing requirement is likely to be the lowest since the early s with the exception of one year <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only agree with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords it would appear from all the figures that have become available recently that british industry is doing rather well in the world at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said british industry appears to be doing very well at the moment <e> <s> it might well do better with lower interest rates but on the other hand we have to keep control of inflation which is just as important to industry as interest rates <e>", "<cs> my lords it is important that public sector expenditure should be firmly under control if we are to have a healthy and growing economy <e> <s> if the local authority cannot find better ways of saving money than sacking teachers it is unfortunate <e>", "<cs> my lords we are tending to stray rather far from the question on the order paper <e> <s> i have no doubt that if the noble lord will be patient until next tuesday my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer in his budget speech will no doubt answer many of the questions which have been posed <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not accept that <e> <s> but i must say that that question also strays somewhat from the question on the order paper which concerns the size of the public sector borrowing requirement for this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that there is a connection between the two <e> <s> the important point is that unlike certain major countries in the world which have not only a public sector deficit but also a large balance of payments crisis we have only an unfavourable balance of payments at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords that strays even further from the question on the order paper than some of the previous questions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the figures for the first six weeks of the year to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> while not meaning to sound at all complacent about those figures one needs to put them a little into perspective <e> <s> one needs to look at the figures over a longer period of time before identifying trends <e> <s> the establishment of the british transport police underground division has risen by per cent <e> <s> since from to although not all of the posts are filled at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords of course consultations with the unions concerned are important and those have taken place <e> <s> the introduction of automatic ticketing will of course mean that staff no longer have to check tickets at station exits and that therefore they can be redeployed to improve visibility and availability to passengers <e> <s> that is one of the ideas behind focal points at stations <e>", "<cs> my lords the latest figures are that of an establishment of posts are currently filled <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not entirely accept that suggestion <e> <s> however staffing at stations is a matter for consideration in the investigation into the kings cross disaster <e> <s> that inquiry may make observations on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the noble lords point <e> <s> another important matter is that liason with the metropolitan police should be improved <e> <s> that matter is being looked into at the moment together with the other measures which i mentioned in my original answer including improved communications on the underground <e> <s> together with liaison with the metropolitan police that should prove to be of great help <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly true that improved lighting in stations can be of great help <e> <s> that is one of the matters that is being considered <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> that is one of the reasons for the investment which we are making in security on the london underground at the moment <e> <s> in my answer i dealt only with crime on the underground <e> <s> however looking at overall government investment or authorisation for investment that is running at million per day at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i gave a figure for a total complement and people are currently in post <e> <s> i imagine that as the noble baroness says that

international securities self-regulating organisation if certain conditions are satisfied <e> <s> however the activities of members of the organisation will continue to be regulated under the act <e>

into a little explanation regarding this matter <e> <s> i believe it is an important point which has been raised by my noble friend and also by the noble lord lord williams of elvel <e> <s> i should like to stress that the power introduced in the restriction of scope of act order to exclude certain activities from the scope of the act is simply a power <e> <s> no decisions have yet been taken about whether it will be exercised in particular cases <e> <s> no application has yet been made for the power to be exercised <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that it is a very good point <e>", "<cs> my lords on the noble lords point about lautro the director-general of fair tradings report is being considered <e> <s> it is only the first part of the director-generals report <e> <s> the secretary of

their authorisation in that way <e> <s> the sib has not made any regulations for pricing but section of the act prevents the secretary of state from making a delegation order <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble lords first question about secondary offerings is yes <e> <s> the order is concerned with secondary offerings as i think i made clear in my opening remarks when i said that stabilisation activities are also sometimes carried out when a security is offered for sale otherwise than at the time of issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that the expression was also referred to in the financial services act <e> <s> i have no doubt that when the bill went through your lordships house there was an opportunity to raise that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord cares to turn to paragraph on page he will find the expression there <e> <s> however i shall look into the point that he has raised and as i said earlier i shall write to him on any points of detail that he has raised <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the right reverend prelates general welcome to the proposals contained in my right honourable friends budget yesterday <e> <s> had the right reverend prelate asked the question last wednesday i should not have been able to give the answer so his sense of timing in having asked it today is immaculate <e> <s> each individual measure will be introduced as soon as is practical <e> <s> independent taxation is a major change in the tax affairs of millions of couples and it will need careful preparation <e> <s> for that reason it was not possible to introduce the measure until <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the first part of the noble lords question and i shall pass on his remarks to my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer <e> <s> as regards there being a substantial difference between men and women i believe that all noble lords recognise that to be the case <e> <s> we believe that the tax system should recognise the financial responsibilities of marriage <e> <s> without the married couples allowance the married mans tax threshold would fall substantially <e> <s> i cannot at the moment give an answer regarding the figures which the noble lord quoted <e>", "<cs> my lords that has little to do with the question before the house <e> <s> that refers to the discrimination between married and unmarried couples <e> <s> the package that was introduced in yesterdays budget removes the discrimination against marriage and i believe that it should be welcomed from that point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i shall do so and i am grateful to my noble friend for her remarks <e> <s> when the package is finally complete in april there will be no further discrimination against marriage <e>", "<cs> my lords their husbands will not have to pay rates <e> <s> therefore the situation will be even more equal than at present because the husband and wife will each pay the same as compared with the present time when the husband probably pays the rates <e>", "<cs> my lords there are other transport matters that have to be discussed by the transport ministers council <e> <s> aviation has been discussed extensively over the last few years <e> <s> we finally had agreement to the package only last december <e> <s> while we still remain committed to making further progress and we have a commitment from the transport ministers council to make progress by other matters sometimes have to be dealt with <e>", "<cs> my lords we have a convention that replies should not be longer than words i think it is in order not to take up too much of your lordships time at question time <e> <s> however i am happy to tell the noble baroness and the house the two secondary items that were not taken <e> <s> when the house hears them perhaps it will not feel that they were of such great importance <e>", "<cs> my lords the house made the rule i understand but i merely try to adapt to the wishes of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords we are involved in discussions with other european countries on ferry safety <e> <s> that extends beyond our ec partners <e> <s> it involves two countries which are not members of the ec <e> <s> it is not therefore a matter that was on the agenda for the transport ministers council but i can assure the noble lord that we are still talking with those european countries that have ferry services between ourselves and them <e>", "<cs> my lords i could not agree more with the noble viscount <e> <s> the governments views on this are quite straightforward <e> <s> my right honourable friend notified his colleagues of his intention to seek an enabling power in the merchant shipping bill currently before another place to introduce a test of establishment for shipping companies which engage in cabotage trades in united kingdom coastal waters <e> <s> he also urged colleagues to find a formula for the liberalisation of cabotage trades so that agreement could be reached on this subject at a subsequent council <e> <s> i understand that considerable part of the june council will be devoted to this and other outstanding shipping matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can give any undertaking on that <e> <s> it is not a matter for me <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the point <e> <s> i try to give a concise answer <e> <s> if i expanded into matters i am asked to go on to deal with my answers certainly would not be concise <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the welcome the bill has been given by the noble lord lord underhill and by my noble friend lord <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps there will not <e> <s> as i have said the bridge does not have to be named <e> <s> what is important is the signposting on the primary route network <e> <s> i believe i have dealt with that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords at the moment i cannot answer the question about consultations <e> <s> however i should like to remind noble lords that motorists are used to following signs to dartford tunnel in whichever direction they are travelling <e> <s> in future the signs will say dartford rather than dartford tunnel or dartford bridge <e> <s> i believe that that is a minor adaptation for motorists to make rather than changing the signs to dartford bridge or dartford tunnel or to any other name which may be chosen <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord underhill and lord greenway for their support for the two sets of regulations <e> <s> in view of the debate on the last amendment at the committee stage of the previous bill i would remind the noble lord lord underhill that the act was passed in the last days of the previous administration and that they were the ones who decided to have the negative procedure for the main orders <e> <s> we have had a brief but useful debate and i am encouraged to hear the wide measure of support for the application of these proposals to foreign ships <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord that the newspapers have given somewhat confused reports on that point <e> <s> in the case of somebody who has been taken into the interview area if the police have not picked out the fact that the driver is over the limit a department of transport official will invite him to rest until he is legally able to continue the journey <e> <s> in extreme cases officials will offer a driver a lift to a destination if the passenger is unable to drive <e> <s> i should make it quite clear that if in spite of being over the limit or appearing to be over the limit the driver insists on continuing he will be warned of the consequences and referred to the police at the entrance to the survey area <e>", "<cs> my lords if that information comes to the attention of the police as they stop a driver to direct him into the interview area he will be subject to the normal rules and will be prosecuted if he is found to be over the limit <e> <s> if it comes to the attention of the department of transport officials what i described in my previous answer will happen <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for telling the house the view of rospa <e> <s> that view is also shared by the police who also are in favour of the survey <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that the survey is valuable and we hope that it will produce valuable data on which we can base our future counter-measures against drink driving <e> <s> that is the whole point of the survey <e> <s> as all noble lords will be aware we are very anti-drink driving and the survey will increase our knowledge of the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble and learned friend knows much more about the legal aspects of the matter than i do <e> <s> however it seems to me that the purpose behind the survey is valuable and if something can be learned from it it is worth doing <e>", "<cs> my lords there is little i can add to what i have already said <e> <s> if the police find or suspect that a driver is over the limit on being stopped to go into the survey area then the normal course of the law will take place <e> <s> on the other hand a driver who has stopped in the survey area who has been questioned about his drinking habits by department of transport officials and who is then found to be over the limit will be allowed to remain there until he is fit to leave <e> <s> however should he try to leave the area while still over the limit then of course he will be handed over to the police <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> that is not the case the motorist is not immune from prosecution <e> <s> should the police on stopping him and inviting him to go into the survey area suspect or find that he is over the limit then he will be prosecuted in the ordinary way <e>", "<cs> my lords if the driver attempts to leave the survey area before he is so sufficiently rested to have rid himself of the excess alcohol he will be referred to the police who will no doubt do what they normally do in such circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that after today my noble friend and other noble lords will at any rate be slightly better informed of what we are actually trying to do following some of the reports that have appeared in the press <e> <s> however i emphasise that this scheme is an experiment <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already said this is an experiment to try to increase our knowledge on the subject <e> <s> i think all noble lords will agree that drink-driving is a serious problem and we should therefore do all we can to increase our knowledge of the matter <e> <s> that is the purpose of the experiment <e> <s> and it is an experiment <e> <s> we have only one police force <e> <s> if a policeman suspects someone of being over the limit he will carry out what is the normal procedure in such circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not unfortunately a lawyer <e> <s> however i am sure that those who devised the experiment were well advised by lawyers <e> <s> i do not believe that there is anything taking place which is against the law <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the house that the tests will take place at carefully selected sites which i do not think will include motorways <e> <s> in answer to the noble baronesss original question most research is based on data that we gain from drivers who have been involved in accidents <e> <s> the work we are currently undertaking will complement that by providing data from a sample of the general driving population <e> <s> we shall be looking to find out about personal characteristics attitudes to drinking and driving and drinking habits <e>", "<cs> my lords we have no plans to make mirrors compulsory <e> <s> we take the view that motor-cyclists should decide for themselves whether they wish to fit mirrors <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be the case <e> <s> whether the situation would be improved by fitting a mirror is the real question <e> <s> we believe that reliance on mirrors by motor-cyclists is inadvisable <e> <s> rule of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not certain that consultation has taken place <e> <s> this is the first time that i have been aware of any feeling that mirrors should be compulsorily on motor-cycles <e> <s> mirrors are normally fitted to handlebars which is the same as fitting a mirror to the steering well of a motor car every time one changes direction the mirror changes its attitude and is therefore of limited value <e>", "<cs> my lords for the reason that i have just given normally the mirror would be fitted to the handlebar <e> <s> when the motor-cyclist changes direction the attitude of the mirror changes <e> <s> that is not something i think it is something which has been commonly recognised for many years <e>", "<cs> my lords he could of course if he had a mirror and most motor-cyclists do <e> <s> we believe that they should not rely on a mirror <e> <s> it is much better if they look round <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall draw the attention of my honourable friend to the remarks that have been made in your lordships house <e> <s> as i said earlier it has never appeared to be a cause of great concern that motor-cycles should be compulsorily fitted with mirrors <e> <s> if it is becoming so i shall obviously draw my honourable friends attention to the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i will <e> <s> i do not know whether there were consultations in the past <e> <s> i am not aware of consultations but there may have been in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether we should move in one go from having no compulsory mirrors to having mirrors on both sides of the motor-cycle <e> <s> in view of the debate that has taken place in the house this afternoon i am sure that it is a matter which we should think about <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has put very succinctly what i have been trying to say during the course of this question <e> <s> i pointed out that mirrors normally fitted to handlebars do change their attitude but vibration is also a problem on motor-cycles <e> <s> therefore we still very firmly advise that motor-cyclists should look over their shoulders before changing direction <e>", "<cs> my lords about uk airlines currently hold air transport licences <e> <s> we have more airlines than any other country outside the united states and our travellers are increasingly enjoying the benefits of competition on domestic and international routes <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly aviation provides about jobs and contributes million per year to our balance of payments <e> <s> also it accounts for nearly two-thirds of foreign <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not certain whether that question relates to the question on the order paper <e> <s> i was asked how many airlines there are in the united kingdom and i gave the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords a great many of them are running scheduled services some only run scheduled services some run both scheduled and charter services <e> <s> but with the increasing blurring between the charter and the scheduled markets a great many of the previous charter-only operators are now running scheduled routes <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept that there was a disagreement <e> <s> however as my right honourable friend the chancellor made clear in his budget speech exchange rates play a central role in domestic monetary decisions as well as in international policy co-operation <e> <s> greater exchange rate stability will bring advantages to the economy in general and to industry in particular <e> <s> however exchange rate stability does not mean immobility and adjustments are needed from time to time <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> there are three factors which affect industry <e> <s> the most important is the containment of inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly do not accept that my original answer was either inaccurate or unfair <e> <s> as for the remarks made by my right honourable friend the prime minister i do not believe that she has taken to making idiotic remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i can hardly accept that the british nation is suffering at the moment with exports holding up extremely well and reserves extremely buoyant <e> <s> the exchange rate has shown greater stability over the past year <e> <s> as i said earlier our primary purpose must be to contain inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords i do indeed <e> <s> i am glad to be able to say that that was a long time ago <e> <s> of course there are problems when sterling is too strong <e> <s> however we do not wish to return to the era of attempting to fix rates <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have an answer for the noble earls question concerning bank deposits <e> <s> i shall write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i could not possibly give an answer to that question even if the original question had been about unemployment which it was not <e> <s> however it would be even more damaging to employment figures to allow inflation to rise <e>", "<cs> my lords we keep the matter of joining the exchange rate mechanism under continual review as i have said on many occasions in your lordships house <e> <s> however i do not accept that joining the exchange rate mechanism would necessarily protect us or indeed anyone else from currency fluctuations <e> <s> the countries within the mechanism are not protected from realignments nor from frequent changes in interest rates <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i said anything to the contrary <e>", "<cs> my lords interest rates were reduced last week because we do not wish to see an unsustainable rise in the exchange rate and because overall conditions made the one-half of per cent <e> <s> interest rate cut appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is correct in many of the points he makes <e> <s> the british economy has been transformed over the past nine years <e> <s> nowhere has this been more marked than in manufacturing industry <e> <s> manufacturing exports rose by per cent <e> <s> last year alone <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that the bundesbank publishes figures for intervention in germany but in the united kingdom successive governments have found that exchange market intervention tends to be more effective the less that is revealed in public about its precise details <e> <s> the article which of course i have read suggesting that intervention might have cost the taxpayer billion during contained one particularly fatal flaw in that it did not take account of our substantial dollar liabilities as well as our assets <e> <s> while our assets may be lower in sterling terms as a result of the dollars fall our liabilities are smaller too <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not our practice to comment on market tactics <e>", "<cs> my lords publication even months later could give the market an indication of our tactics <e> <s> that is why we do not believe that it is a good idea to publish even at that stage <e>", "<cs> my lords intervention is a weapon that can be used to attempt to bring some stabilisation to exchange rates <e> <s> as i have said it is not our practice to comment about when we are or are not doing it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are straying a little way from the question on the order paper which concerns the exchange equalisation account <e> <s> however the government do publish a budget every year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his question <e> <s> the government have been successful <e> <s> the level of our reserves at the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord obrien who has his great experience at the bank of england to back up his judgment <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a hypothetical question <e> <s> to produce figures for what might have happened had we done something would be beyond anybodys ability <e>", "<cs> my lords as i attempted to say earlier intervention is an ongoing matter <e> <s> one can only tell whether it has been profitable or not when the details have been completely unwound <e> <s> that does not usually happen at any particular point in time <e> <s> as i said earlier to produce the figures even after a -month period could give a clue as to how the operations take place <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the answer is probably no <e> <s> we spent a good deal of time last year during the passage of the bill and in your lordships select committee discussing this subject <e> <s> there is a great deal of communication between the inter-governmental commission and the safety authority and eurotunnel <e> <s> i do not believe it would be useful for each and every item on that agenda to be discussed in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give the noble lord and the house an absolute assurance that the safety authority has made it clear throughout that it will confine itself to the safety implications of eurotunnels proposals and not to the economic disbenefits to eurotunnel <e> <s> one of the issues upon which eurotunnel will need to undertake further work is the role of the personnel involved on the shuttle trains <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i am quite out of time to answer that question <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i beg to move that this house do agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> at the same

question to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i can <e> <s> as i said in my original answer the new companies will be regulated by the bank of england <e> <s> it is for members of buildings societies to decide whether they wish to allow their society to be converted <e>", "<cs> my lords the voting turnout level required for conversion to a successor company is per cent <e> <s> of the members <e> <s> of that per cent <e> <s> three-quarters of depositing members must vote in favour of the conversion <e> <s> so far as borrowers are concerned a simple majority of borrowers must vote in favour <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said the shareholders will have a say whether the society <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely right in saying that financial management at the top is of critical importance <e> <s> as to whether it will be difficult for a building society to become a plc we agreed the provisions during the passage of the act <e> <s> at that time we felt that that was the correct way to deal with the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that a building society will have to make certain that it will be recognised by the bank of england as a bank before it goes down that path <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be the case <e> <s> however the government decided during the passage of the act that it was time to allow building societies to take part in the provision of various financial services other than those which are their traditional activities <e> <s> at the moment they are still confined in great part to the provision of home loans <e>", "<cs> my lords if a plc is to take part in banking activities it must be authorised by the bank of england <e>", "<cs> my lords the building societies act allows building societies to engage in activities in which they traditionally were not allowed to engage as well as attracting more wholesale deposits <e> <s> even if they do not become plcs they will still have more flexibility than was previously the case <e>", "<cs> my lords successive governments helped to ensure that international conventions so provide <e> <s> the tokyo convention requires states to take appropriate measures to restore unlawfully seized aircraft which land within their territory to lawful control <e> <s> the hague and montreal conventions are concerned that offenders should be brought to justice <e> <s> the international civil aviation organisation has produced guidance on the response to hijacks <e> <s> we shall press for further nations to sign those conventions <e> <s> we shall encourage icao to take further action to improve procedures to frustrate this crime <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the foreign secretary put forward to the european council of foreign affairs ministers recently a new five-point action plan which if adopted would we hope strengthen our hand against terrorists <e> <s> the plan included proposals that the hague convention should be strengthened <e>", "<cs> my lords we work continually with other states to improve the agreed standards and to ensure that they are properly enforced <e> <s> as to united kingdom practices we shall examine the recent incident to see whether any improvements are necessary <e> <s> we are in constant touch with the international civil aviation organisation to make certain that proposals are carried out <e>", "<cs> my lords one point in my right honourable friends five-point plan was that an international task force should be set up to investigate the hijacking and examine security arrangements at the relevant airports <e> <s> that should be set up under icao auspices <e> <s> we take very seriously the need for such action but it must be done through international agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already said that we continue to put pressure on other countries through the various organisations and <e>", "<cs> my lords we agree that the algerians faced considerable difficulty <e> <s> nevertheless it is regrettable that the hijackers appear to have been allowed to go free <e> <s> the prime responsibility must of course be for the safety of the passengers in the hijacked aircraft <e> <s> as to the noble lords second question about a call for sanctions i am afraid that i do not have an answer at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords that is rather a different question <e> <s> but the governments view remains that we should not give in to hijackers <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a matter which should definitely be kept very much in mind <e> <s> in this country the government are responsible for security at airports <e> <s> i believe iata said recently that we are among the best in that respect <e> <s> as to foreign airports it is the responsibility of british airlines which serve those airports to satisfy themselves about the security arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said there are already conventions which if properly enforced should deal with those matters <e> <s> my right honourable friend the foreign secretary has put forward his five-point plan to strengthen those conventions <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously the judgment of the european court will have to be studied very carefully as i said <e> <s> as the noble lord will be aware the government have deregulated opticians to some extent over the past few years <e> <s> that has resulted in quite a substantial fall in prices <e>", "<cs> my lords the sixth directive was agreed by all member states in when a previous government were in power <e> <s> therefore we have to abide by the findings of the court <e> <s> as regards the national health service the supply of spectacles which are free or covered by the voucher scheme will need to be looked at <e>", "<cs> my lords as concerns the request for the pleadings to be made public i shall have to draw the attention of my right honourable friend to the noble lords remarks <e> <s> as to whether parliament is responsible in this case we adopted the sixth directive in and therefore we have to abide by the rulings in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said we shall have to give careful consideration to the findings of the court and we shall have to consult the trading associations <e> <s> i am aware of the noble lords interest in this matter and we shall have to consider how next to proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords that is true <e> <s> legislation will be required to bring it in <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give my noble friend that assurance at present <e> <s> i shall bring his remarks to the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state for health who no doubt will consider the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not certain how the court goes about such matters <e> <s> presumably as we were taken to court we must have been represented <e> <s> we opposed the proposal otherwise we should not be in the position that we are in now <e>", "<cs> my lords we are now straying from the question which concerns vat on the sale of spectacles <e> <s> however i have taken on board the remarks made by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the house will be grateful to my noble friend lord hood and to the other members of the select committee for hearing petitions and presenting this report to the house <e> <s> the committee had what i believe my noble friend termed a chequered history with petitioners frequently asking for adjournments <e> <s> i am sorry that that was so <e> <s> the department took pains from the outset to consult a series of interested parties including some who did not find it necessary to petition <e> <s> i hope that the committee will accept that the negotiations with petitioners did not drag on through stubbornness on the part of the department <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for my noble friends remark <e> <s> however it would be wrong to start with any preconceptions as to the possible results of the study <e> <s> i therefore think that we shall have to wait and see <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a little early to know what the review will produce <e> <s> however we shall have to take environmental considerations into <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is referring to the evidence given by the caa to the select committee in another place which is currently investigating air traffic control safety <e> <s> of course airspace capacity is of great importance <e> <s> there are three factors runway capacity airspace capacity and terminal capacity <e> <s> all three have to be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords aviation safety is a matter for the caa <e> <s> it is satisfied that the use of the emergency runway during runway repairs at night time at gatwick is satisfactory <e> <s> on the point about a second runway for gatwick that is ruled out until by an agreement between the baa and the county council <e> <s> that is the answer on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords my answer was that there was an agreement between the baa and west sussex county council until which ruled out a second runway for gatwick <e> <s> i am afraid that that is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously i shall give further thoughts to that matter but i do not think there is a chance of a second runway at gatwick for the time being any way <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i have already answered that point <e> <s> yes taking the advice of the civil aviation authority which is responsible for safety matters we believe that it is safe for gatwick to use its emergency runway at night <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> as i said in an earlier answer airspace capacity is equally important to runway capacity <e> <s> i assure the house that safety must be paramount in all our considerations <e>", "<cs> my lords civil aviation safety is the statutory responsibility of the civil aviation authority <e> <s> we are confident that the caa is well able to fulfil that role <e>", "<cs> my lords if a beer or lager is alcohol-free it will not be affected by these proposals because there is no duty on them <e> <s> however beers with an original gravity below degrees at present pay the duty at the degree rate but from st october beers with an original gravity below that level will pay proportionately less duty <e>", "<cs> my lords the price at which such drinks are sold is a commercial decision for the brewer or the publican <e> <s> it is not a matter in which the government can intervene <e> <s> i understand that some of the drinks cost more to manufacture than beers containing alcohol <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure what we can do <e> <s> if people are prepared to pay pence for half a pint of lemonade in a pub presumably that is the market rate <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be helpful if at this point i briefly intervene to give the governments view on the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is right <e> <s> we are talking about the rear seats in motor cars <e> <s> as i say there are issues still to be resolved in deciding how the law should apply in practice <e>", "<cs> my lords i hate to disappoint the noble lord but i suspect that there was no connection between him putting down his question and the fall in interest rates which took place at that time <e> <s> as i said in my original answer we are committed to maintaining a firm monetary policy and a downward pull on inflation <e> <s> that as far as unemployment is concerned is the most important aspect <e>", "<cs> my lords i can do no better than to quote from my right honourable friend the prime minister on th may <e> <s> she said <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the exchange rate mechanism of the ems i can do no better than to repeat an answer that i have given in your lordships house on many occasions namely we will join when the government consider that the time is right <e>", "<cs> my lords countries within the erm are not protected from realignments and sometimes suffer some quite painful readjustments <e> <s> as regards the proposals for a central bank of europe most of those who have put forward these proposals have recognised that they are very much in the long term <e> <s> the immediate priority must be given to achieve liberalisation of capital movements throughout the community <e>", "<cs> my lords if as i suspect the noble lord is arguing for a sharply lower sterling exchange rate i am certainly not prepared to advise or even to mention it to my right honourable friends in the treasury <e> <s> it would surely lead to a vast increase in inflation which is the most damaging thing that could happen <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obviously fearful of what the noble lord might do and therefore i shall draw his remarks to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble and learned friend makes a very good point <e> <s> i do not flatter myself that the markets would take a great deal of notice of what i say in this house this afternoon but it certainly does no good to speculate about such matters <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the only reply that i have <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i understand the noble lord <e> <s> i was replying to the noble lord lord bruce who suggested that we should lower interest rates <e> <s> that would result in a fall in the exchange rate which would be inflationary <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to the arguments advanced by my noble friend lord teviot and other members of the committees in support of the amendment <e> <s> i was grateful to my noble friend for enunciating so clearly some of the concerns which are felt about our measure <e> <s> i hope in a moment to deal in some detail with the points that he has raised and i very much hope that what i have to say <e>", "<cs> i think i have just given an example of how the ptas would rather find themselves not having to <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could continue <e> <s> but i think there is definite evidence that the districts have distanced themselves or attempted to distance themselves from decisions made on their behalf by the pta and i think the example i have just given is a good one <e>", "<cs> i think i should go on at the moment <e> <s> we have had a long debate and i have quite a lot of questions to attempt to answer <e> <s> i shall try to deal with any other points that are raised <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill referred to the late introduction of the charge to direct billing <e> <s> ideally we would have wished to produce all our proposals upon the first publication of the bill but this was a change which required time for reflection <e> <s> we also delayed a decision on the change to give more time for comment after originally offering what we realised was a very brief period <e> <s> therefore i trust that the debates in both this house and in another place have now allowed the questions to be fully aired <e>", "<cs> that is no different from the present situation <e> <s> the ptas have to set their budgets on an annual basis and the budget has to be agreed as it is now <e> <s> that will not change in the future <e>", "<cs> they will still have to have their budgets accepted by their members as they do at present so that will continue <e> <s> i think it may be helpful if i say a few words on the mechanics of the change <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may remind the noble lord that secession is an option that is available under the present system and it has been since the act <e> <s> in any case i have said that my right honourable friend will have to satisfy himself that proper provision has been made if he intends to allow secession to take place <e> <s> i should be surprised if districts were not aware of what represented the best value for money for their electors <e>", "<cs> i look forward to my noble friends amendment at report stage but it seemed to us that this was a good time to introduce this change <e>", "<cs> i said that if my noble friend proposed that kind of amendment at report stage the government would clearly have to consider it very carefully <e> <s> that i am afraid is as far as i can go at the moment but it is an undertaking which i hope the committee will be prepared to accept in good faith <e>", "<cs> my lords these new services are spread all over the country where minibuses are providing fast frequent and popular services in both rural and urban areas including i understand newcastle <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the benefits of deregulation is that these services can start up and serve the needs of the customer <e> <s> i am surprised to hear the right reverend prelate state that some services have been taken off <e> <s> that may be the case although overall the numbers are still increasing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that question which bears out what i have been saying <e> <s> it is an example of how deregulation has made bus operators respond to the needs of the customer <e>", "<cs> my lords we had a long debate on that matter at a very late hour last night <e> <s> it does not seem very long ago <e> <s> however at the end of that debate the committee decided that the governments proposals were right <e>", "<cs> i am using the evidence of front seat belt wearing as an example of the kinds of savings in life that can take place <e> <s> i have every reason to believe as i said before and shall say again that the impact of making children wear rear seat belts will make a significant improvement in the accident rate <e> <s> anyone who has seen the short film which has been produced showing how children are thrown about in cars involved in accidents will have no doubt at all about the value of this bill in encouraging the use of restraints <e> <s> i remind the committee that over children are killed and over injured each year while travelling unrestrained in the backs of cars <e> <s> i believe it is irresponsible of us as drivers to expose them to unnecessary levels of risk <e>", "<cs> it is simple <e> <s> the first in is strapped in <e>", "<cs> i have already made it clear that in drafting the regulations we shall consult widely <e> <s> i have made it clear that we shall accommodate the school run <e> <s> the amendment limits the speed to miles an hour and i see no connection between that and the school run <e> <s> many school runs take place in rural areas and drivers will do more than miles an hour <e>", "<cs> i have just said that we cannot bind our successors but the regulations will have to be made by affirmative resolution and therefore they will have to be debated <e>", "<cs> i shall take that point into consideration when we come to draft the regulations <e> <s> as i have said we shall take into consideration all the points made by noble lords <e> <s> i am not sure whether minibuses would have to have seat belts fitted <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend explained very clearly these amendments concern the future control to be exercised over passenger transport authority expenditure <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill reminded us that the government have been exercising precept control over pta expenditure for the past three years <e> <s> our aim now is to create an environment in which that is no longer necessary <e> <s> i trust therefore that i can demonstrate that the concerns expressed by my noble friend lord teviot and by the noble lord lord underhill are unfounded <e>", "<cs> let me repeat what i said at the beginning of my remarks <e> <s> i said that we had no present intention of using this power to set limits on pta expenditure and that we would not wish to do so except in very exceptional circumstances <e> <s> however i cannot give an undertaking that it might never be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord underhill for his understanding <e> <s> i hope that this motion will not come to a vote this evening <e> <s> as concerns the noble lords question about expenses of objectors or petitioners we can consider that point but i cannot make a promise <e> <s> the extra expense that is likely to be involved is minimal because all that needs to be done is to put in the same petition as before <e> <s> i shall certainly undertake to look at it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly repeat what i said the other day which is that consultations on regulations will include what has been said in committee last week and today <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend lord nugent of guildford and the noble lord lord underhill who spoke so well on the amendments that we do not want to see them written into the bill for the reasons that my noble friend has given <e> <s> they will either be much better dealt with in regulations which will need to be carefully drafted after careful consultations or they are matters which are best left under the reasonable excuse clause for instance where the child might undo his own restraint <e> <s> that point would be much better left to the courts do decide on the merit of each case as it is with the front seat belt legislation <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord bruce-gardyne will have to get hold of a copy of the act <e> <s> if he looks at section he will find that subsection after a is subject to the affirmative resolution procedure <e> <s> subsection of this clause adds this bill to that so the point will be covered <e>", "<cs> i shall clearly have to look into this matter raised by the noble lord lord monson <e> <s> if it is necessary to bring forward an amendment at the next stage i shall of course do so <e>", "<cs> i should like to make a correction to my reply to the noble lord lord monson <e> <s> the numbering is purely a printing error <e> <s> the public bill office know of it and it can be put right without an amendment <e>", "<cs> i believe that this argument has been covered over and over again mainly on second reading and again when dealing with amendment no <e> <s> which was debated last week <e> <s> there is no contradiction in what has been said <e> <s> if possible the regulations must specify and i have said that a great deal of care will be taken in respect of them <e> <s> if four or five children are in the back of a car not all or possibly any can be made to wear seat belts <e> <s> however if there are two or three children and two or three seat belts those children should wear seat belts <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could reassure my noble friend and the noble lord lord monson that as my noble friend has said a good deal of statistics and data are collected at the moment published in the road accidents of great britain casualty report which gives data on road traffic accidents casualties including tabulations of child car occupants and casualties by age seating position and restraint use <e> <s> through that we shall monitor the effects of the legislation <e>", "<cs> the government cannot support the amendment <e> <s> i have no doubt that very similar arguments were put forward when compulsory front seat belt wearing came before the house <e> <s> indeed as my noble friend said there is no doubt at all that compulsory use saves lives and that there is no evidence from the monitoring programme that there is need for such a measure <e> <s> therefore we cannot support the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly explain the position <e> <s> northern ireland road traffic legislation is separate from that in great britain <e> <s> while new proposals in britain are usually adopted there is often a time delay of months to two years because of the need to promote an order in council <e> <s> however in those cases where it would be inappropriate for northern ireland to be out of step with the rest of the united kingdom the negative resolution clause approach is adopted <e> <s> that enables the northern ireland order in council to be treated as a negative resolution statutory instrument rather <e>", "<cs> yes by months to two years <e>", "<cs> my lords there will be emergency plungers in the ticket office in the ticket hall control console and also in some instances in the stations operations room <e> <s> there will also be a key switch which acts in a similar manner in the pedestal of the disabled persons gate <e> <s> therefore there will be a number of different places from which these barriers can be opened <e> <s> the barriers themselves operate on a fail-safe principle in that they are held closed by air pressure operating against a spring <e> <s> if therefore there is a failure in the system they will naturally fall into the open position <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said switches will be available in the ticket office and in other places <e> <s> there should always be a competent person available in such a position to operate the emergency switch <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously i shall draw the remarks made by your lordships to the attention of the appropriate authorities <e> <s> in general terms the ticket offices are always manned at the stations concerned <e> <s> the barriers are being installed only in the central area and not at outlying stations <e> <s> it is my understanding that ticket offices at those stations are always manned <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the details of the steps that will be taken to ensure that there is somebody present but my understanding is that there will always be somebody if not in the ticket office at least at the ticket hall control console or at one of the other points at which the switch can be operated <e>", "<cs> my lords essentially it is for london regional transport to decide on the staffing levels needed to meet its statutory safety duty <e> <s> one advantage of the new automatic ticketing is that it releases more staff for supervision and patrol on the stations <e>", "<cs> my lords that must be true <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that my noble friend is entitled to a reply from the government front bench on this matter <e> <s> however i should say to him that eight years is a long time ago <e> <s> times have changed <e> <s> compulsory seat-belt wearing has come into force since that time <e> <s> and it has proved to be very popular <e> <s> i would point out that when front seat-belt wearing was made compulsory the use went up almost overnight from about per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> it has remained at that level <e> <s> we are only talking in this bill about making children wear seat belts compulsorily where they are fitted <e> <s> as far as i know we have no intention at this stage of making adults wear rear seat belts <e> <s> that is a matter that would have to be debated in any case <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment i submit is unnecessary <e> <s> there is no need to add thereover to the existing wording in the bill <e> <s> clause in the bill follows the wording in the relevant passage of section of the transport act dealing with adult seat belts in which section reads <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may just briefly intervene in this debate <e> <s> i know that during the passage of this bill a number of noble lords have made known their concern about how its provisions will apply in practice <e> <s> similar concerns were expressed in another place <e> <s> i recognise that the bill does no more than sketch the outline by establishing the principle of compulsory wearing and i can understand the concern about how the detail will be filled in <e> <s> i say to my noble friend lord bruce-gardyne that during the course of the debates at second reading and in committee stage in your lordships house we discussed quite a number of details <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i believe that i can help the noble lord on that matter <e> <s> i said that we would not rush this process we would not rush any of the processes and that we should proceed step by step <e> <s> i shall undertake to make certain that noble lords who have taken part in these debates are aware of the consultation document that is placed in the library of the house for all noble lords and that the consultation process will take place in good time <e>", "<cs> my lords i should briefly like to congratulate my noble friend on having piloted the bill through the house <e> <s> i believe that it will save lives and give a dramatic boost to the wearing of rear seat belts by children <e> <s> as i said earlier when front seat belt wearing was made compulsory the wearing rates went up from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> almost overnight <e> <s> if my noble friends bill achieves the same kind of result we shall all be proud to have taken part in the debates on it <e>", "<cs> my lords that is correct <e> <s> my figures show that different cars are available at the centre at crowthorne for disabled or partially disabled people to try in order to decide whether they are able to make use of them <e>", "<cs> my lords yes my noble friend is right the scheme is complementary to the motability scheme <e> <s> our scheme will advise disabled or partially disabled people of the kinds of cars which can be driven and of the adaptations which need to be made to make that possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that the committee has raised any questions about publicity <e> <s> this is not the only means of publicity which takes place <e> <s> leaflets are available at the practices of gps rehabilitation centres special schools shows and exhibitions and so forth <e> <s> the unit was represented at belfast last week-end and at huddersfield two weeks ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give only a rough figure <e> <s> for the financial year the running costs and salaries of driving consultants amounted to just over <e> <s> other overheads and staff costs are absorbed separately by the department but i do not have a figure for those <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i said that there would always be available someone in the ticket office or in another place <e> <s> i am assured that whenever a station containing the new ticket barriers is open to the public there will always be someone in charge who will hold the necessary keys to operate the emergency opening devices even though the ticket office is closed <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have comparisons with the paris metro but i understand that there are more staff per station in london than in paris <e> <s> it may be that a different ticket structure in paris accounts for that <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my original answer the inspectorate of railways has looked into this matter and has decided that there is no risk <e> <s> as i further said there will always be somebody at the station who is able to operate the switches <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said or monday there are three different places from where these switches can be operated <e> <s> if there is only one person on duty in the station who has the key to the switch i hope that in attending to his call of nature he does not take too long about it <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to the first part of the noble lords question i am assured by london regional transport <e> <s> that is from where my assurance comes <e> <s> as to the second part i do not have a comparison between the metro system and the london underground but differences may apply <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i believe that i gave the assurance he requires <e> <s> the point is that tickets should be inspected either mechanically or by a person <e> <s> if that cuts down on the amount of cheating it would be good for the london underground <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that because there arc more exits available for people to go through than there were under the manually operated system in an emergency there would be more ways out than there were before <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that information <e> <s> it perhaps assists me in answering earlier questions about comparisons with the paris metro system <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the assurance which i sought between monday and today and i hope i have been able to give that assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords first i do not accept that there are inherent dangers in the present system <e> <s> secondly the present system is already coming into force and is expected to be complete by the end of the year <e> <s> thirdly the london fire brigade has seen the new barriers in operation <e> <s> it made some comments which were taken up by london underground and is now generally satisfied with the barriers and the release mechanisms <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the assurance for which i suspect the noble lord asks namely that he might be included on such a delegation <e> <s> however if such a trip is planned i shall certainly keep in mind the name of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case i believe that representatives from the paris metro would be well advised to come here to see our system which costs the taxpayer a great deal less money <e>", "<cs> my lords i endorse the remarks made by my noble friend in the last part of his question <e>", "<cs> my lords we are straying rather far from the question which is about automatic ticket-activated gates <e> <s> however i remind my noble friend that london regional transport is not an employment agency <e> <s> its job is to provide an efficient railway system <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord jenkin has as ever presented a persuasive case for the amendments in his name and he has been supported by the noble lord lord underhill my noble friend lord teviot and the noble lord lord tordoff <e> <s> noble lords will recall that in committee i gave an undertaking to my noble friend that we would carefully consider the amendments on their merits <e> <s> i can assure the house that we have done so <e> <s> indeed as my noble friend has reminded me my right honourable friend the secretary of state and i met my noble friend to discuss these amendments at some length <e> <s> we should have liked to have been persuaded of their merits rather than have to oppose my noble friend whose fine speech on the second reading of the bill remains with many of us <e> <s> but reluctantly we were not so persuaded <e> <s> i shall now set out the reasons why <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot say whether it does <e> <s> all i can say is that we are not entirely certain whether that is a relevant question <e> <s> however i have just been told that it does not come into that figure so we are still thoughtful about the per cent <e> <s> increase over the next two years <e> <s> while i greatly respect the view of my noble friend lord jenkin based on his valuable work on local government reform up to i cannot agree with him in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords i was attempting to project a possible scenario of what might happen in two years time with or without the acceptance of the amendment <e> <s> i firmly believe that these are the alternative paths we will be treading and which path we tread will depend on the decision <e>", "<cs> my lords my information is as i said that it did not include the costs of the light railway <e> <s> but i am quite prepared to double-check on that <e> <s> i do not have the information with me at the moment <e> <s> having said that it was an increase of per cent <e> <s> in the next two years <e> <s> none of the ptas <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to emphasise that not all the fault lies on our side <e> <s> there are delays in the rest of europe <e> <s> many of the delays recently experienced have been as a result of problems elsewhere in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend will be aware the government have asked officials to collaborate with the caa and baa in reviewing the forecast for air traffic demand in the south-east and the capacity required to meet it <e> <s> i draw the attention of my noble friend to the evidence given by the caa recently to a commons select committee <e> <s> it was made clear that it is air space and not runways that is the real constraint on the growth of air traffic in the south-east and that it will remain so for some time <e>", "<cs> my lords we have done all that we can to assist manchester to expand rapidly over the past few years <e> <s> as regards us routes <e> <s> we <e>", "<cs> my lords the new terminal at stansted and the rail link are expected to open in when that airport will be able to handle million passengers a year <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> as i said we are considering that with the caa <e> <s> the new statement of licensing policy issued by the caa was made after lengthy consultation and the review is the result of that consultation <e>", "<cs> my lords the point i sought to make was that the present shortage is one of air space and not of runways <e> <s> even if another runway was built in the south-east there would not be the air space capacity to cope with it <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards provincial airports except for prestwick they have all enjoyed an extremely high growth rate over the past few years <e> <s> if i recall correctly birmingham is up by about per cent <e> <s> and manchester by about per <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that manston will have a valuable role to play but being in the south-east it will of course be subject to some of the air space constraints in that area <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the dangers the number of air misses has fallen sharply over the past few years <e> <s> in there were aircraft involved in risk-bearing air misses in there were just <e> <s> although we have not had the final figures for i understand that they are no worse <e> <s> that is during a time when the number of flights has risen very considerably <e> <s> as regards the policy of the government and whether we need a new white paper <e> <s> i shall draw the remarks of the noble lord the leader of the opposition to the attention of my right honourable friend <e> <s> broadly speaking our policy remains that set down in the white paper of which is not that long ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall draw those remarks to the attention of the civil aviation authority <e> <s> however the problem is not as simple as that <e> <s> as said the caa says that at the present time it is a shortage of air space and not a shortage of runways which is causing the problem <e> <s> by the mid-s we shall have in place the new central control function which is being installed by national air traffic services <e> <s> when it is installed that will result in a per cent <e> <s> increase in air space capacity in the south-east area which will help considerably <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point made by the noble lady <e> <s> vat is intended to be a broadly-based tax and exemptions from it should be used very sparingly <e> <s> here we are talking only about <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure to what the noble lord is referring when he says that we can easily circumvent the rulings of the european court of justice <e> <s> as regards the application of this relief to non-domestic construction such as local authority communal homes or hospitals we are consulting with charities about that ruling <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend seeks to extend the question somewhat wider than the one on the order paper which is extremely specific <e> <s> i believe that on this occasion i should be unwise to enter into debate with him <e>", "<cs> my lords again we stray rather wide of the question <e> <s> we are still exempt from vat on very many important items such as food and domestic fuel <e> <s> ay my right honourable friend the prime minister said we continue to pursue that policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend is quite right on that matter <e> <s> however the question is whether that personal alarm should be free of vat for elderly people <e> <s> i imagine that my noble friend realises that there would be a number of practical difficulties if vat were to be <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not certain what is the definition of disabled for this purpose <e> <s> if a person is disabled then he qualifies for zero-rating on the system <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to say that i was a little surprised to see these two amendments tabled by the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> when we debated similar amendments tabled by my noble friend lord teviot in committee i felt that i had reassured him and the committee of our intentions with regard to the setting of maximum limits on the pta levy <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has put down two groups of amendments which both in different ways have the effect that grant would be paid direct to the passenger transport authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the explanation is in the words <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house again the point i was making was that they are not services to the local authorities as such they are services to the people in the local authority areas <e> <s> that is not the same thing as providing services for the local authorities such as the type of services i described <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house once more and i think for the last time i cannot give the assurance that my noble friend seeks <e> <s> as i said in my original remarks the money goes to the districts <e> <s> it is up to the districts whose representatives make up the pta to make their decisions on their spending priorities over their entire range of services <e> <s> however as i said i have little doubt that they will continue to attach importance to the provision of socially necessary public transport <e>", "<cs> my lords the plans are that there should be airport-style controls at waterloo station similar to those in operation at airports and seaports at the present time <e> <s> we do not accept that these controls will cause significant delay because the time taken to get through customs and immigration is normally minimal <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously i cannot speak for the french government <e> <s> but if the trains are to be non-stop from waterloo through to paris then they will have to arrange something at the paris end <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are well aware of the situation <e> <s> at present we are awaiting a report from british rail on the capacity constraints between london and the tunnel <e> <s> we expect the report to be published very shortly <e> <s> that will clarify the situation as to whether there is a need for a new high-speed link <e> <s> i cannot anticipate the conclusions of that report at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords talks between british rail and the treasury not forgetting immigration and its controls are still continuing with regard to the provision of on-train controls for services going beyond london to the north <e> <s> i know that was a subject that greatly concerned your lordships when the bill was passing through this house <e> <s> at that time the government agreed to facilitate on-train controls for those trains <e>", "<cs> my lords it is really a matter of convenience to people <e> <s> i do not accept that any significant delays will be caused <e> <s> delays at airports are generally caused by people waiting for their baggage <e> <s> once they have it they normally pass through immigration and customs extremely quickly unless there are suspicious circumstances <e> <s> of course we still need controls and we shall continue to need them to deal with drugs and terrorism and so onthe alternative of on-train controls for the waterloo services would require travelling customs and immigration officers it would be quite an expensive use of manpower <e> <s> furthermore it would mean that people were approached in the middle of their lunch for instance when they might prefer to have these matters dealt with on reaching waterloo <e> <s> there is an argument for waterloo <e>", "<cs> my lords the cost of the customs hall at waterloo will be between million and million <e> <s> that is a one-off cost for building it whereas keeping customs and immigration officials on the trains is an ongoing costfurthermore even if there were on-train controls there would still need to be facilities for the customs and immigration services at the terminal at waterloo so they would not all be new costs <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot honestly give an answer to that questionquite a number of trains will be operating on the line at the same timei do not know what the figure will be but each train will have to have its own number of peopleit is not possible for me to give an answer to the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> my lords we are fully committed to reducing the barriers to trade within <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that all the facts were studied carefully before the money was raisedindeed i do not think the money would have been raised unless the investors knew what they were letting themselves in for <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to clarify the situation in so far as there was any doubt <e> <s> however <e> <s> i do not think that there should have been any <e> <s> since my noble friend lord trefgarne made his remarks in we have had the white paper of <e> <s> perhaps i may quote one sentence from paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that there is any conflict between what i said on llth may and what was said by my noble friend in <e> <s> in any case that matter may be irrelevant <e> <s> we have a white paper and the policy has been quite clearly stated <e>", "<cs> my lords we are straying slightly from the question on the order paper <e> <s> we went over this ground only last week and we shall go over it again this coming friday when i have a question to answer on airspace congestion <e> <s> however i would just point out that only last week my right honourable friend the secretary of state asked the caa for advice under section of the civil aviation act on the airport capacity to and on strategies to make good use of air space in the short to medium term <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is quite true <e> <s> it is my understanding that the new north terminal has been built on the site on which a possible second runway might have been built <e>", "<cs> my lords no doubt we shall have a clearer view when the civil aviation authority responds formally to the formal request made by my right honourable friend only last week <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble baroness overstretches the point somewhat <e> <s> as the noble lord lord graham pointed out a moment ago and as i have said from this dispatch box on several occasions recently the main problem at the moment is lack of airspace capacity in the south-east of england <e> <s> that is a problem that needs to be resolved before there can be any question of another runway at gatwick or indeed anywhere else in the south-east <e>", "<cs> my lords any such delays are due to the general balancing of demand for air traffic flow management purposes within the united kingdom air traffic control system <e> <s> i would point out to my noble friend that for example on friday a fortnight ago heathrow had its busiest ever day with over air traffic movements <e>", "<cs> my lords we have asked the caa to look into what can be done in the short term before we go on to consider the long-term problems <e> <s> as i said we hope to receive a report by <e>", "<cs> my lords earlier this year we brought in a new regime for night flights at both heathrow and gatwick <e> <s> over the next five years at gatwick where the problem is greatest we are planning an increase of per cent <e> <s> in the night flights allowed <e> <s> that would be at the expense of the noisier aircraft and to the benefit of the quieter ones <e> <s> there are means whereby delays caused by particular difficulties such as the greek problem can he alleviated by allowing night landings or take-offs <e> <s> that is what is happening at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> eurocontrol was set up years ago to deal with that kind of problem <e> <s> i must say that over the first years it has not had any great success <e> <s> as president of eurocontrol i pressed at the meeting a couple of weeks ago for much greater co-ordination much greater pooling of plans and investigation in the short term of ways in which congestion could be relieved <e> <s> i have asked for a report on that by the next meeting in november <e>", "<cs> my lords we have done a great deal over the years to encourage the use of regional airports <e> <s> however regarding the current problems the delays are just as bad at manchester birmingham newcastle or anywhere else in the country <e>", "<cs> my lords stansted is being developed at the moment and the first stage of the development will be complete by <e> <s> it will then be able to handle million passengers a year and there will be a new fast rail link into liverpool street <e> <s> so far as concerns the m that is a slightly different question <e> <s> there is nothing to stop planes from scotland using stansted either now or when it is fully developed <e> <s> however it will still he within the london terminal manoeuvring area and possibly subject to delays as a result <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the problem <e> <s> that is why this flow control has had to be introduced <e> <s> the main reason for it is safety so that there should not he more than the number of planes that can safely be handled in any given sector <e> <s> over the slightly longer period we shall be getting a new air traffic control system which will give a per cent <e> <s> increase in capacity by <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure to which computer the noble lord refers but if it is the central control function that i have just mentioned which will be coming fully into operation in it will give a per cent <e> <s> increase in capacity in the london terminal manoeuvring area <e> <s> there are other plans for the other different computers <e> <s> the nats has a programme of investment of million over the next few years <e> <s> all that should help the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i have tried to say that the government are looking into the problem of relocating government offices elsewhere <e> <s> the department of education and science has not yet taken a firm decision on any further moves of des posts away from their present location but the matter is under review <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services recently published a report which identified up to dhss headquarters posts which were potentially suitable for transfer away from london <e> <s> other departments are also looking into what can be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give details of the psas plans on this occasion <e> <s> however as i said earlier departments will be reviewing their work locations with a view in suitable cases to finding locations offering advantages in terms of recruitment and retention of staff value for money and other considerations relevant to service delivery and management <e> <s> i am sure that when they do that and plan to relocate work they are required to give regional policy and territorial departments an <e>", "<cs> my lords that must be one of the aims <e> <s> if there is any move planned to take place it must be done efficiently <e> <s> there will always be a need for a headquarters staff of some sort in central london to service ministers who in turn have to service parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may give the noble lord a further example of a government department which relocated in scotland to east kilbride <e> <s> that was not a whole government department but considerable parts of the overseas development agency <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland announced on th june that taking account of all quantifiable costs and benefits that is estimated to have produced a significant saving in national resource terms of some - million <e> <s> furthermore the overwhelming majority of the staff who transferred expressed the opinion that the quality of life was higher in east kilbride and they preferred their new location <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i have covered everything so far in my answer <e> <s> this <e>", "<cs> my lords i should point out that four-fifths of the civil service is located outside greater london and since some civil service posts have been transferred from london under the governments dispersal programme <e> <s> in addition departments have on their own initiative relocated well over posts out of london and the south east <e> <s> as i said earlier we shall continue to look into the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures i have given to the noble lord are exactly the same figures which i gave to him in a written answer on th march this year <e>", "<cs> my lords fences are struck thousands of times each year <e> <s> on average over three years injury accidents are reported each year on motorways in england where the vehicle has hit the safety fence <e> <s> of that number only have gone through or over the fence and over half of them involved heavy goods vehicles <e> <s> in answer to my noble friends last point i agree that there is a balance to be struck <e> <s> if a fence is not resilient the damage done to a vehicle hitting it is likely to be disastrous <e>", "<cs> my lords out of the many accidents that happened last year only vehicles <e>", "<cs> my lords already per cent <e> <s> of motorways have a central barrier <e> <s> those which do not are where the two carriageways are sufficiently far apart <e> <s> it is better not to have a central barrier if the carriageways are far enough apart because vehicles can run off rather than go into the opposite carriageway <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the assessment to which i referred and which is now taking place <e> <s> it is expected to be completed later this year and the results will then be made public <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to hear my noble friends report <e> <s> i am not so concerned about the damage to his motor car i should have been much more concerned if my noble friend had been damaged in the accident <e> <s> i believe that the incident proves that the crash barriers work very effectively <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot tell my noble friend how many of the accidents happened at night <e> <s> i came prepared with a number of statistics but i am afraid that that is not one of them <e> <s> the lights of oncoming vehicles are a problem but certain stretches of motorway are fitted with overhead lights which reduce the problem and certain stretches also have a barrier of some kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i always come prepared with as much information as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords no i cannot <e> <s> out of the vehicles which went through or over the barriers half were heavy goods vehicles <e> <s> but cannot define which went through and which went over <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an extremely good idea where the space between the carriageways allows it <e> <s> i must admit that i do not know of our policy on that matter but i have seen a number of roads where it has taken place <e> <s> however it relies on there being sufficient space between the carriageways <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that all the barriers are of the same standard as that encountered by my noble friend <e> <s> as i said earlier an assessment is being made to discover whether stronger or different materials can be used <e> <s> we shall report publicly on the matter later this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lord is mistaken in his last conclusion <e> <s> i agree that some footings have been found to be misshapen but the trrl investigated that and published the result which confirmed that that did not significantly impair the performance <e>", "<cs> my lords the night noise restrictions at gatwick which my right honourable friend announced in february permit the airport manager to exempt flights from the restrictions if they are delayed by widespread and prolonged disruption of air traffic <e> <s> this has already helped to relieve the effects of major foreign air traffic control disputes <e>", "<cs> my lords each case is dealt with on its merits <e> <s> the general rule is that if these delays are caused by widespread and prolonged disruption of air traffic exemptions can be given <e>", "<cs> my lords this policy of night landing or night movement restrictions at both gatwick and heathrow particularly gatwick as regards the present situation was reviewed by my right honourable friend <e> <s> we published our plan for the next five years which allows for an increase in the number of night movements at the expense of phasing out some of the older aircraft <e>", "<cs> my lords if heathrow and gatwick are to maintain their positions as leading airports in western europe and indeed in the world they must have the flexibility to allow night flights to be operated from them <e> <s> we have to try to mitigate the noise effects of those night flights and we have to maintain a balance between the interests of the residents and those of the travellers <e>", "<cs> my lords as to the noble lords first question about my right honourable friends request to the caa to produce new proposals by november on easing air traffic control restrictions and by next july on airport capacity both in the south-east and in the country as a whole the secretary of state in his letter asked the caa to take into account environmental considerations <e> <s> we now have our policy for night flights set out for the next five years and i should think it unlikely that we shall be advised by the caa to change that <e>", "<cs> my lords quite possibly <e> <s> however we now have a plan for stansted to be developed to deal with million passengers by <e> <s> i am not a historian as to what happened over the past years as is the noble lord lord jay <e> <s> at the moment i am more concerned about what will happen next weekend and the weekend after <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that as regards the current situation which we arc facing of delays to aeroplanes to gatwick about which i am being asked in the question prestwick could have nothing to offer to relieve those delays <e>", "<cs> my lords they are bound to be suffering because of something which has gone wrong with the system as a result of those delays over a period of time <e> <s> therefore i hope that they would be accommodated within the dispensations which are able to be given <e>", "<cs> my lords we have done a great deal to encourage the use of provincial airports over the past few years as anyone who cares to look at the figures will see <e> <s> the main problem in the past few weeks has been one of air space over europe and difficulties with the destinations to which people are travelling <e> <s> if my noble friend looks at the figures for the delays i am afraid that he will find that provincial airports have been as badly affected as the london airports <e>", "<cs> my lords that is true but i tried to answer that <e> <s> we are interested in the overall amount of noise created <e> <s> while landings obviously make far less noise than take-offs if one is looking at the overall noise created and we are committed to reducing that amount of noise over the years one has to take both into account <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend is referring to edinburgh airport which is a long way <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case i am not certain that it is very relevant to the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords we have decided to discontinue this database because it was too expensive to maintain indefinitely <e> <s> now that deregulated bus services are well established we shall be able to rely upon normal statistical returns from the operators to monitor developments in local bus services <e> <s> i can confirm to my noble friend that the statistical branch of the department of transport will continue to publish statistics on a variety of matters including vehicle kilometres run patronage passenger receipts fares and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware that oxford university was carrying out this study for the association of metropolitan authorities nor was i aware that it is said that there are inaccuracies in the statistics produced by the database <e> <s> however as i have said the database is to cease <e> <s> we shall continue to publish statistics based on the figures sent into us <e> <s> those will continue to be published by the department <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very different question <e> <s> in this situation we were receiving two sets of statistics one set provided by the database of the trrl and one set produced by the department <e> <s> that seemed to be a waste of resources <e>", "<cs> the government are aware of the concerns in some parts of the housing association movement which i believe underlie these <e>", "<cs> my understanding is what i said and perhaps it would be best for me to write to the noble baroness clarifying the situation if that would be helpful <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly look into that situation <e> <s> we propose that tenants should have <e>", "<cs> we have already debated the proposal that there should be a separate housing association tenancy and this amendment is related to that earlier proposal <e> <s> the purpose of noble lords who have moved the amendment is quite clear <e> <s> they would like us to provide explicitly on the face of the bill that rents should be affordable by the client groups for which housing associations have traditionally catered <e> <s> indeed the purpose of the amendment is to supplant the concept of the fair rent which at present applies to housing association tenancies with the concept of an affordable rent <e> <s> in character as i read their amendment an affordable rent would be very similar to a fair rent inasmuch as both seek to keep rents below market level <e>", "<cs> we shall be discussing mixed funding in more detail when we come to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i shall be delighted to answer the noble baronesss question then <e> <s> however we do not expect all housing associations to opt for mixed funding but certainly a great many of them <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord swinfen put the last point extremely well <e> <s> i was going to say something along similar lines but i do not think that i need now do so <e> <s> i am sure that amendment no <e> <s> has the best interests of the housing association movement at heart <e> <s> the government also have those interests at heart <e> <s> indeed they would not be seeking so actively to increase the role of the housing associations if they did not have such a commitment <e> <s> i am afraid that it is to misunderstand the role of the housing corporation and housing for wales to suppose that the amendment could help to secure the effects which we want <e>", "<cs> at this moment i am not able to respond very positively to the suggestion <e> <s> if the noble lord tables what i would call a slightly less draconian amendment we should have to look at it on its merits <e> <s> but i cannot give any assurance that we would look at it particularly favourably <e>", "<cs> i hope that i shall be able to say rather more <e> <s> there has been a long tradition of local authority support for housing associations which we greatly value <e> <s> however it is widely recognised that the present arrangements for paying housing association grant hag on local authority sponsored schemes are very unsatisfactory involving much delay and confusion of accountability <e> <s> the noble lord lord mcintosh referred to the difficulties that were encountered <e>", "<cs> i am not entirely clear whether the noble lords lord ross of newport and lord graham of edmonton were speaking to clause stand part <e>", "<cs> if i may i shall answer both debates and include clause stand part at the same time <e> <s> i must tell the noble lord that i do not believe that his amendment would have the effect that he wishes <e> <s> it seems that it is intended to emasculate clause by preventing the housing corporation from making payments of grant conditional on the later repayment of surpluses <e> <s> clause is self-contained and the duties that it imposes on associations are not dependent on conditions having been made on the payment of grant <e> <s> therefore the amendment would have no effect on the operation of the rent surplus fund arrangements in clause <e>", "<cs> i readily concede that it is a modest sum in comparison with the total resources available for grants and loans to associations from <e>", "<cs> i apologise if i misunderstood the noble lord <e>", "<cs> an important underlying objective this bill is to make it easier for housing associations to co-operate with the private sector in the development of new housing schemes <e> <s> the reason for that is quite clear <e> <s> if public and private sectors can co-operate where up to now only the public sector has been involved we will be able to make our public sector resources stretch further and get far more homes for the same money <e> <s> let me briefly explain the background <e>", "<cs> i did however refer to figures for the past year and the current year and how it looked as though investment was coming in for the programme <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has rightly drawn our attention to the importance of the ethnic dimension in housing provision <e> <s> we believe that this bill will do much to remedy some of the problems of discrimination which have been referred to partly by extending the scope of section of the race relations act to the housing corporation and housing action trusts <e> <s> i ought at once to mention that clause was introduced by the government in another place following moderately and persuasively <e>", "<cs> this is an important issue <e> <s> i wish to speak to the governments amendment no <e> <s> in response to some of the points which the noble lord lord graham of edmonton made <e> <s> we believe that our amendment responds to a number of the respresentations which the government have received from the housing association movement <e> <s> it extends to england wales and scotland <e> <s> in so far as it extends to scotland it reproduces an amendment to the housing scotland bill to which the chamber has already given its approval <e>", "<cs> i said in my speech that the housing corporation would be required to consult the movement before determining the classes of case to which section is to apply <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that those consultations will take place <e>", "<cs> my lords no not necessarily <e> <s> as a great deal of the deficit in the balance of payments is being used to finance investment in manufacturing productivity and so on in the medium term it will be greatly to our benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords i was just about to deal with that <e> <s> as i said what disagreement <e> <s> i must tell the noble lord that there is no disagreement on the most important point namely the fight against inflation <e> <s> the fight against inflation is paramount <e> <s> both of them agree and so do i that monetary policy should remain tight <e> <s> that means higher interest rates and a strong exchange rate at times like the present when our economy is growing faster than its long running trend rate of growth <e> <s> it also meant lower interest rates last october when everyone was concerned about the threat of recession following the stock market crash <e> <s> the fact that there did not appear to be a recession following the stock market crash last october is a considerable achievement not only for the managers of this countrys economy but for the managers of other western economies <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that there was anything wrong with different views being held on the opposite side of the house <e> <s> i know very well the views held in that corner of the house although neither noble lords nor the noble baroness mentioned them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that what i am leading up to saying will not be exciting <e> <s> it will only be the same as i have repeated at question time on many occasions that is we shall join when the time is right <e> <s> it is not the immediate panacea <e>", "<cs> my lords it may not be possible for me to write to the noble lord <e> <s> i suspect that when the time is right and we join it will be something that has to be done in some secrecy so that it does not have an effect on the exchange markets <e> <s> it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to repeat it <e> <s> i said that the economy is not overheating <e> <s> it is growing above the long-run trend and needs to slow down at the moment but that does not mean that it is overheating <e> <s> the benefits of this strong growth are spreading through to all the regions <e> <s> i agree that unemployment is still too high in some regions <e> <s> that is why growth needs to be sustained and why above all inflation needs to be kept low <e> <s> the investment boom will help to sustain growth without overheating at a healthy rate and will further reduce unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords of

in force at gatwick and heathrow on night flights were only set earlier this year <e> <s> however there is the possibility an opportunity that is being used of relaxing those restrictions in times of hardship to passengers <e>", "<cs> my lords we have been over this ground on many occasions recently <e> <s> i read the article but i have to say that government policy remains as stated in the white paper not to build a second runway at gatwick <e>", "<cs> my lords the caa or national air traffic services have a programme of investment of million over the next few years <e> <s> that will include

state will be going to frankfurt for the next meeting <e> <s> the matter of industrial relations problems is on the agenda <e> <s> however the countries involved which are so heavily dependent on the tourist trade for their livelihoods must also be aware of the difficulty and must do their best to sort out their own problems <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously i was not aware of the noble lords particular difficulties over his holiday <e> <s> however it may well have been that air traffic control problems played a part in the beginning of the difficulties because very often this summer there have been air traffic control delays and that has caused the airlines concerned to get out of step <e> <s> however if it was nothing to do with that i can only sympathise with the noble lord but it is not a matter on which i can act <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lords first question i am not aware whether or not the ec trade union organisations have become involved in this problem <e>

relations record <e> <s> there have not been any industrial relations problems this year <e> <s> there are nevertheless problems of capacity and that is a subject which the civil aviation authority is

scotland to visit it <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first question the commissions proposal is for an amendment to the directive on the regional air services agreement <e> <s> it would remove the -seat and -tonne weight limit it would remove the kilometre minimum route length and it would remove the protection for existing direct and parallel services and would permit fifth freedoms <e> <s> it is

it heartening that there is this growing interest in road safety matters <e> <s> that concern is reflected by many others outside the house <e> <s> the general public is increasingly concerned about

that it was the intention of the commission to table proposals <e> <s> the fact that it did not get around to doing so cannot be put down to me <e> <s> as i said we have a number of organisations

answer some of the points raised this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said we are committed to maximising the potential in through the completion of the single market <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord makes a good point <e> <s> at the end of the day it obviously appears to amount to the same thing <e> <s> there is another point of detail raised by the noble lord lord bruce <e> <s> he asked why the own resources decision in the iga could not be printed as a schedule to the bill <e> <s> i do not believe that there is any need for it to be so because both have been published as command papers they are freely available to anyone who wishes to see them <e> <s> perhaps i should not say freely available but they are available <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord queries it the

growing and have grown very strongly over the past few years <e> <s> unfortunately the air traffic control problems affect regional airports as much as the london airports <e>", "<cs> my lords this question specifically refers to regional airports therefore it is <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we shall keep an open mind on the question <e> <s> as i said we are expecting advice from the caa <e> <s> we asked for it by next july and it will no doubt give us some clues as to what to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer for the supplements which the tour operators put on these prices <e> <s> it is possible that the handling charges at the regional airports are more expensive than those at gatwick and heathrow <e>", "<cs> my lords some noble lords say no but i dare say they have no figures to give me on the matter <e> <s> as manchester is further away from majorca there is extra flying time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of the situation regarding the rail link to prestwick <e> <s> i shall have to look into it and perhaps write to my noble friend <e> <s> we should be keen to see more flights using prestwick airport <e> <s> at the moment it is very underused <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said there has been a large expansion of services from regional airports <e> <s> i know that manchester airport now serves more than overseas destinations <e> <s> as i said in my original answer we continue to attempt to negotiate deals with overseas countries in order to increase that number <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right these things take a long time to settle <e> <s> in fact they take far too long to settle <e> <s> when stansted comes fully on stream in in its first stage it will be capable of handling eight million passengers a year <e> <s> that should relieve the

operators to use those airports if that goes against passengers will <e> <s> i remind noble lords that per cent <e> <s> of passengers using airports in the south-east emanate from the south-east <e>", "<cs> my lords that is exactly what we have asked the caa to advise us on <e> <s> the caa has a statutory duty to advise us on these matters <e> <s> as i have said the caa will be consulting the airlines <e> <s> it is through that channel that we will receive the advice <e>", "<cs> my lords that is true <e> <s> the purpose of the study we have invited the british ports federation to undertake is to see whether it is a practicable proposition <e> <s> however i cannot really say more about it at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords there are many ways in which other countries pay for navigational aids <e> <s> in a good many countries in europe it is a charge on central taxation other countries have a similar system to our own <e>", "<cs> my lords where the cost is met by central taxation there is of course no charge for light dues <e> <s> in relation to elsewhere i cannot say without notice exactly how charges compare <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not wish to anticipate any decisions to be taken following the proposed study <e> <s> ideally the charge should be targeted at sea-going craft and the administration of any scheme would have to be sensibly based to allow proper enforcement <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no question of any additional charges being caused by anything i have said today <e> <s> it is merely a reallocation or possible reallocation of the existing charges first to spread the net a little wider and secondly to correct some discrepancies in a system which has basically remained unaltered this century <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be delighted to hear from the noble viscount of his experiences in yugoslavia but as i said in my original answer we feel that the user should where possible pay <e>", "<cs> my lords through our agents the general lighthouse authorities we have succeeded in reducing those costs <e> <s> last year they were down by per cent <e> <s> and i hope that we shall see a similar reduction in the coming year <e>", "<cs> my lords we have been in touch with the royal yachting association about our proposals but as i have said the matter is at an early stage <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said the matter is at an early stage <e> <s> we have asked the ppf to look into it <e> <s> the main point is that the system must be fair and should be targeted on those who use the navigational aids be they foreign or british <e>",

derived from automatically processed data or collecting storing and processing the data <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord is right <e> <s> there have been some very successful moves <e> <s> departments will continue to look for sites which offer easier labour markets reductions in accommodation and other costs and increased operational efficiency <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the northern region which i think includes those areas if it does not i do not have the relevant figures a substantial number of civil service jobs are in that region <e> <s> at st april there were jobs in the region <e> <s> in terms of civil servants per of population the northern region scores almost as high as the south-east despite the latter including the national capital and the seat of government <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i cannot give figures for scotland but i know that certain departments have transferred substantial parts of their operation to scotland including the overseas development agency <e> <s> that was a successful move <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that in total some per cent <e> <s> of the civil service is located outside the south of england <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot give the noble lord details as specific as that <e> <s> from my own personal experience in the department of transport i know that the largest unit of all within that department the dvlc is located at swansea <e> <s> it is very happy there <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord obviously was not listening to my answer because i quoted an example from last year <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments policy on that subject has been announced by my right honourable friend the paymaster general <e> <s> the policy is that it is now for departments to decide in their own interests what moves to make and therefore there is no central target <e> <s> however as i have attempted to indicate there are plans under way and a number of moves are taking place <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i am not quite sure how the noble lord distinguishes between the government and the departments which represent the government <e>", "<cs> my lords in my original answer i gave the total since which was approaching jobs <e> <s> what that represents as a percentage of the total i am afraid i cannot say <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i know of no plans at present which would involve such a transfer <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened very carefully to the noble lords questions <e> <s> i gave examples of further moves which have taken place last year the dhss moved jobs to newcastle and there was a further move by the department of education and science to darlington <e> <s> those are new moves which have occurred since this government came to power <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly have no plans to force people to move out of london <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord is quite right and that there are advantages in transfer <e> <s> i should point out that when the overseas development administration moved a part of its operation to east kilbride my right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland confirmed that taking account of all the quantifiable costs and benefits the dispersal is estimated to have produced a significant saving in national resource terms of some million <e> <s> furthermore the overwhelming majority of the staff who transferred expressed the opinion that the quality of life was higher in east kilbride and preferred their new location <e>", "<cs> my lords in my original answer i said what the policy was as the noble lord will see if he cares to read what i said <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to enable charges imposed under section <e>", "<cs> my lords i now return to the kings cross disaster <e> <s> clearly a full inquiry had to be set up into so shocking a disaster <e> <s> within a week of the fire the government appointed mr desmond fennell qc to make a formal investigation into the fire under the regulation of railways act <e> <s> public hearings were held lasting no less than days in which evidence was heard from witnesses and scientific studies were carried out to explain how a small fire grew into something with such dreadful results <e> <s> mr fennells report was published by my right honourable friend the secretary of state on th november this year <e> <s> the report concluded that the immediate cause of the fire was a lighted match falling into grease and detritus which had built up beneath the escalator and which ignited with the terrible results that we all know <e>", "<cs> my lords although it is more than a year since the disaster and time is supposed to heal wounds we all know that it will be a long time before those who suffered loss or injury will be able to come to terms with let alone forget the consequences of that terrible night <e> <s> and we pay tribute to the courage and dedicatior displayed by the members of the emergency services on that night <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had this afternoon a constructive debate on a matter which is as serious as it is important <e> <s> i acknowledge the firmly held and positive points of view which have been put forward from all parts of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already mentioned that extra trains will be provided <e> <s> there are other examples and that is not the end of the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord jay will allow me to go further in my speech he might find that i will answer these questions <e> <s> i shall of course attempt to answer all questions put to me by noble lords and if i am not interrupted too often i shall be able to continue with that task <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord makes a very interesting point <e> <s> it is now the policy that the london fire brigade should be called in the case of any kind of a fire <e> <s> i believe it was the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that is the paintwork on the ceilings to which i was referring and this product has been exonerated <e> <s> as regards the target dates for these safety measures about which the noble lord lord underhill asked me to be more specific i understand that the removal of the wooden panelling on the escalators should be completed by july to august of next year <e> <s> automatic sprinklers under all escalators should be installed by december <e> <s> as regards underground radio communications known as the leaky feeder system which permit the use of radios underground these should be installed at deep tube stations by the end of february <e> <s> there is also a pilot scheme involving trained staff with radio and help point booths <e> <s> that is already in operation at stations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i shall have to write to the noble lord on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree that we fall behind the european standards because those standards were set as a result of the luxembourg package and will apply throughout the ec countries <e> <s> as regards lean burn technology under certain driving conditions i am not aware of the problem to which the noble viscount refers <e> <s> lean burn technology has advantages in the ordinary course of events in that it cuts down on the contribution to the greenhouse effect by increasing fuel efficiency <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord has jumped the gun somewhat <e> <s> we shall be dealing with leaded petrol in the next question <e> <s> however my information is that a car which is able to run on unleaded petrol can perfectly well use leaded petrol <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right although we suspect that even the smaller cars will need the single oxidation catalyst i believe that is what it is called which is not nearly so complicated as the three-way catalytic converter <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has i think warned joggers very effectively <e> <s> we are of course committed through the measures that i have outlined in reply to this question and through the use of unleaded petrol to improve the atmosphere <e>", "<cs> my lords we have not reached the question which relates to lead in petrol <e> <s> we seem to be dealing with the first two questions of the noble viscount together <e> <s> however my advice to my noble and learned friend would be to buy a new car that will run on unleaded petrol <e>", "<cs> my lords the first generation of lean burn engines is already on the market and being fitted to cars <e> <s> both ford and rover are wholly committed to this technology <e> <s> i understand that these engines run on a ratio of to as against a conventional engine which has a ratio of to <e> <s> the second generation of lean burn engines are expected to operate with ratios of to or greater <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not the information i have <e> <s> my information is that if a car is capable of being converted to run on lead-free petrol and i shall be dealing with that matter on the next question then no harm can come to it by using leaded petrol if one cannot find a supply of unleaded petrol <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not certain that i can answer the second part of my noble friends question <e> <s> but there is no doubt that anything that we can do to improve the atmosphere in particular in cities must be good <e>", "<cs> my lords there are about model variants of new vehicles on sale in the uk at present <e> <s> detailed information about what fuel they can use is available in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble viscount <e> <s> i should like to see everyone making an effort to use unleaded petrol <e>", "<cs> my lords it should not have to be cheaper because there is the tax differential which allows unleaded petrol to be sold at around p a gallon cheaper than leaded petrol <e> <s> different garages sell petrol at different prices <e> <s> i can only hope that all garages will be selling unleaded petrol fairly soon and the differential should then exist <e> <s> in the uk petrol stations will be selling unleaded petrol by the end of this year <e> <s> the number is increasing by about or a week <e> <s> obviously the more garages that sell unleaded petrol the better <e>", "<cs> my lords the policy is that all new cars bought for the government car service will be capable of running on unleaded petrol <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right except that she used the words most of us have to use <e> <s> as i said earlier about two-thirds of all cars do not have to use leaded petrol <e> <s> the amount of lead in petrol has been dramatically reduced over the past few years <e> <s> in the maximum amount of lead allowed in petrol was reduced from to grammes per litre with effect from st december <e>", "<cs> my lords the oil companies are fully supportive of the move to unleaded petrol <e> <s> we have had numerous discussions with them and as i say they are fully supportive <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe there is no difference in the fuel consumption <e> <s> it is possible that cars which run on unleaded petrol use slightly more but certainly not enough to make a difference in the costs <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that leaded petrol will continue to be available for a good many years because there are still cars being produced today which cannot run on unleaded petrol and they must have a life of some considerable length <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not have the answer to that question <e> <s> i saw a report in the press and i have not yet been able to find out whether there is any validity in it <e>", "<cs> my lords we commissioned a study by consultants in to make an inventory of all trunk road direction signs within the m and to review the present system of signing <e> <s> the study found that a large number of signs gave inconsistent or incorrect information and that the system as a whole is out of date <e> <s> for example it does not take account of the completion of the m <e> <s> the consultants recommended a new system of area signposting <e> <s> we hope to be able to consult formally with the local authorities and interested organisations on the proposals in the new year <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with my noble friend that the present system is totally unacceptable <e> <s> sixty-five per cent <e> <s> of the signs recorded were discovered to be unacceptable to varying degrees <e> <s> if all goes well the new system could be installed in <e>", "<cs> my lords the present system is unsatisfactory <e> <s> the new system would work as follows there would be a direction initially to one of areas based on compass points for example south-west london and signposts within the area would carry the name of a strategic centre for example kingston and the new area destination <e> <s> when the system is introduced it will solve the problems referred to by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the cost is estimated to be approximately million at present prices <e> <s> if that sounds a great deal of money i should point out that it would cost million merely to put the present system right <e> <s> i believe that it is good value therefore to spend the extra money on obtaining a new system <e> <s> eighty per cent <e> <s> of the signs are on trunk roads and the cost would fall to the government <e> <s> the remaining per cent <e> <s> are on the non-trunk roads <e>", "<cs> my lords that is probably true signs can also be the cause of congestion <e> <s> it is hoped that the new signposting system will not route traffic to where it does not need to go <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that if one wants go to to the north they are helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords yes we hope to go to consultation early in the new year on the principles of the scheme as i have outlined <e>", "<cs> my lords the question about street names is slightly different from that on the order paper <e> <s> however i shall draw the attention of my right honourable friend to the proposal made by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have attempted to describe it is much more than repainting a few signs <e>", "<cs> my lords if the system works perhaps it can be extended around the country <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the problems which i have outlined are not new and no doubt occurred when london was run by a different organisation <e> <s> in strategic terms trunk roads are the predominant roads and there is a single authority for them namely the secretary of state for transport <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a slightly different question from the one on the order paper <e> <s> however we shall be debating the subject on thursday afternoon when we reach the bill which deals with that system known as auto guide <e> <s> if the noble lord lord paget or any other noble lord would like to drive a car fitted with the device i should be grateful if they would let me know <e>", "<cs> my lords yes of course <e> <s> as i said in my original answer much more still needs to be done <e> <s> included in the investment programme over the next three years is million on a major continuing renewal programme for track signalling structures lifts and escalators the repair of track tunnel stations bridges and so on resignalling on the metropolitan and district lines modernisation of the signal control and communication systems and new lifts and escalators at some stations <e> <s> in addition to that there are new additional trains being built which should come into service next year <e>", "<cs> my lords part of the million is involved in escalators <e> <s> this is in addition to the million which has been allocated specifically for safety measures resulting from the fennell report which we debated on monday <e> <s> it involves a good deal of work on the wooden escalators <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said on monday million will be spent specifically on safety measures and finance will not be a barrier to implementing any of the fennell recommendations <e> <s> on egress from stations my noble friend is probably referring to the automatic barrier system <e> <s> this is also being reviewed <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord that we had a good debate on monday on the general topic <e> <s> indeed the figures that i announced then gave some indication of the amounts of money and the undertakings that have been made on safety measures <e>", "<cs> my lords no not at present <e> <s> that may or may not be a matter to come up in the central london rail study <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure what my noble friend means by train drivers and <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only take note of my noble friends request <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer specific questions on individual underground stations around london <e> <s> that is not a matter for the government but is a matter for the board of london regional transport <e> <s> no doubt the noble lord will wish to make his complaint to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure how that problem should be dealt with but the noble lord makes a good point <e> <s> patronage of the london underground is per cent <e> <s> up on the past six years which is contrary to everything that the planners previously told us <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that it would be wise for me to enter into a debate on that <e>", "<cs> my lords without looking at the standing orders i believe that it is not <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said the central london rail study will be published in the new year <e> <s> i do not know what recommendations that will contain <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly do that <e> <s> at present new trains are being constructed and i mentioned the metropolitan and district lines <e> <s> i am not sure whether that would apply to part of the circle line <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the proposals in respect of the inter-regional air services agreement are still under consideration at official level <e>", "<cs> my lords i have heard of the air transport users committee report but i have not yet received my copy <e> <s> however i saw members of the committee yesterday evening <e> <s> we share some of their concerns about the present air traffic control situation <e> <s> during previous question times i have given detailed information about what is happening <e>", "<cs> my lords the dates proposed for the new spanish presidency provide that there will be an informal council on th february and formal councils on th march and th june <e>", "<cs> my lords there are still a number of oustanding issues in respect of the interregional air services agreement <e> <s> in general they concern the extent of liberalisation appropriate on <e>", "<cs> my lords although the question strays well away from that on the order paper i hope that there will be no problems in respect of my noble friends latter point <e>", "<cs> my lords our debate today has been both wide-ranging and constructive <e> <s> i am grateful to all noble lords who have taken part and who have raised so many important and topical issues <e> <s> i am also grateful for the general welcome that the bill has received this afternoon <e> <s> i shall be able to say a little about the governments position on these issues as i now attempt to respond to the main points that have been made <e> <s> many detailed points have been made as well and i cannot promise to answer them today <e> <s> i have no doubt that some of the issues will return at the committee stage <e> <s> i can tell noble lords that full notes on clauses will be available tomorrow which i hope will assist noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to both questions is that it is for members to decide whether or not conversion is a good thing for them <e> <s> the government are neither for nor against conversion <e> <s> regulations were made this year to remove both artificial obstacles and artificial inducements to conversion <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord makes a very good point <e> <s> i should say that the answers i have given so far apply to anyone irrespective of whether they might be described as working class or otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of the article in todays <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no question of the government laying claim to any of the assets of the building societies nor in fact did we get anything out of the privatisation of the trustee savings bank <e>", "<cs> my lords i mentioned in the debate on the kings cross fire on th december that london regional transport is appointing outside consultants to review the new underground ticketing system as recommended by mr fennells report on the kings cross fire <e> <s> questions of this nature will no doubt be covered by the review <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept what my noble friend says <e> <s> i should point out that there are three emergency plungers situated in any one station one in the ticket office and two in other places <e> <s> however we will wait to see what the independent review comes up with <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be the case at present but if the system goes ahead all existing tickets will be replaced over a period of time with tickets which are accepted by the machines <e>", "<cs> my lords the railway inspectorate has certain powers of enforcement under the health and safety at work legislation it is at present satisfied in general with the safety of the system <e> <s> my right honourable friend has no power to direct london underground in such matters of detail <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not seen that article <e> <s> i shall obviously look into the matter <e> <s> but until now the london fire brigade is generally satisfied with the safety arrangements <e> <s> at least that is the official view <e>", "<cs> my lords it would only make sense if there were only one price of ticket <e> <s> as there is more than one price there could be opportunity for fraud <e> <s> i should point out to noble lords that london underground calculates that it loses in the region of million a year through fare evasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i dealt with that matter fairly fully during the debate that we had on the kings cross disaster <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not have a figure for the total receipts <e>", "<cs> my lords that is perfectly true <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly <e> <s> as i said to my noble friend we have the power to appoint the board of directors and to sack the board <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i believe that to be another question and one that i have dealt with on a number of occasions <e> <s> my noble friends question refers to exits from the stations <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i hope that it will be concluded by march <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a quite different question from one concerning london regional transport <e> <s> however it is the first i have heard of it <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> obviously we shall monitor the progress of the safety audit on lrt <e> <s> the million to which i referred in my original answer was for the specific safety measures so far identified <e> <s> as i said in the debate on the fennell report finance will not be a barrier to implementing the fennell recommendations <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall be debating the subject of the possible privatisation of british rail later this afternoon <e> <s> i can say in advance of that that we have no present plans to privatise british rail <e> <s> if we do it certainly will not be within the lifetime of this parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i have written to the noble lord <e> <s> i have certainly seen a draft of the letter that i propose to write to the noble lord which will explain the situation to him <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is willing to put down a question to that effect i shall attempt to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord lord mountevans for raising this subject this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to the second part of the question tabled by the noble baroness of course we shall not hesitate to take the opportunity to put forward proposals on further liberalisation and to remind the council to secure early progress on that issue <e> <s> we are confident that the commission will bring forward its proposals by the agreed date of st november <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my original answer this is an informal council and therefore it is for the presidency to decide the agenda for it <e> <s> so far as i am aware the presidency does not propose to discuss aircraft or airport security <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful that the noble baroness raises these questions at regular intervals <e> <s> it gives me an opportunity to put forward the governments views on liberalisation and other matters <e> <s> indeed i do not think that there is very much between the noble baroness and myself as regards our ultimate objectives <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the answer is that being an informal council it is not a council at which decisions can be taken but one at which subjects can be discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords the government do not propose to relax the night noise restrictions at heathrow and gatwick next summer <e> <s> at stansted where there are comparatively few night flights the restrictions apply only to the noisiest types of aircraft <e> <s> the case for relaxing these does not arise <e> <s> a series of measures aimed at relieving air congestion this year is being implemented by national air traffic services hut in the event of widespread or prolonged disruption the airport managers are empowered to exempt delayed flights from the quotas <e>", "<cs> my lords our new night restrictions were introduced only last april after widespread public consultation <e> <s> our intention remains to see an improvement in the noise climate at airports <e> <s> we do not wish to renege on promises made to the airport communities <e> <s> therefore we do not propose to alter our night noise regime <e> <s> however as i said in my original answer dispensations can be given in the event of widespread and difficult delays and those will continue <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i think that prestwick airport is a very different subject from the one on the order paper and one on which i have only recently written to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that traffic in london is becoming congested <e> <s> that is why we are looking at a number of ways of tackling the problem <e> <s> however we do not believe that a strategic body needs to be set up <e> <s> we want action not bureaucracy <e> <s> past attempts at master plans have failed <e> <s> they have taken too long to prepare and they have been too inflexible <e>", "<cs> my lords london regional transport has been asked by the government to examine the current and future terminal requirements for express coach services in london <e> <s> it is considering alternative options to paddington and possible short-term improvements to victoria coach station <e> <s> it is also talking about alternative arrangements to the battersea wharf site <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly take away my noble friends suggestion on a specialist traffic police force <e> <s> illegal parking is one of the main problems in central london <e> <s> we have made significant progress on that problem with the introduction of clamps but it is a fact that illegally parked vehicles cause a disproportionate amount of delay <e>", "<cs> my lords bus lanes are kept under review <e> <s> they are brought in when they can be justified <e> <s> as regards investment on the underground i believe the largest ever programme of investment will take place over the next few years <e> <s> that should bring relief for some of the congestion on that system <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have hoped that that would be a helpful suggestion on the part of my noble friend <e> <s> i said that we did not want too much bureaucracy and that we wanted action <e> <s> i remind your lordships that had the glc which has been gone for only three years been able to solve the problems of londons traffic we should no doubt be enjoying the results now and we are not <e>", "<cs> my lords a central london rail study is currently being undertaken and the results will be reported shortly <e> <s> the study group consists of representatives from london regional transport and the british rail network so that there is a body such as the noble lord described <e>", "<cs> shortly my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as concerns the rail system both the underground about which i have already spoken and british rail network southeast there are plans to invest billion over the next five years to improve the situation in the area <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise that the noble lord asked me a question on that subject a short while ago when the bridge was closed as a <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the answer to that question <e> <s> i shall look into the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the latest available figures show that over per cent <e> <s> of all share and deposit account balances held by individuals in building societies stand at or less <e> <s> the existing statutory limit of therefore already provides generous protection for the vast majority of investors <e>", "<cs> my lords the figure of can be reviewed from time to time to take account of inflation <e> <s> i do not know whether there are any plans at present to undertake such a review as that figure was i think only set when the act was passed in <e> <s> however as i said in my original answer the vast majority of people have less than on deposit with a building society <e> <s> if people have more they are able to spread their deposits around more than one building society <e>", "<cs> my lords if a building society converts to a bank it comes under the banking level of protection for depositors which is per cent <e> <s> of up to <e> <s> i emphasise that when putting the idea of conversion to its members a building society would have to point out that fact <e> <s> as far as abbey nationals conversion is concerned that is a matter between the building society and its members <e> <s> the government remain neutral as to whether building societies should or should not convert <e>", "<cs> that is right my lords <e> <s> the statutory deposit scheme is applicable only to sums of and under <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of any consultations that have taken place with the building societies association <e> <s> obviously if the building societies association wishes to approach the government with a view to changing that situation we should be happy to hear from it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i am not sure i can envisage the situation where my right honourable friend would find no-one with whom he would need to consult on this kind of matter <e> <s> this same requirement applies already to regulations made under the road traffic act <e> <s> we believe it appropriate that similar arrangements should be made in this bill <e>", "<cs> i fully appreciate the object of my noble friends amendment <e> <s> the changes that he is seeking are not necessary as i think he said in his opening remarks <e> <s> the application of the provisions of part iii of the road traffic act to vocational licences will mean that provisional licences may be issued for drivers seeking to drive passenger-carrying vehicles <e> <s> the conditions attached to this provisional entitlement will be conveyed in regulations to be <e>", "<cs> i explained a moment ago that there are problems with the existing system which make change difficult <e> <s> however i shall look into the matter to see whether anything can be done in the short term <e> <s> perhaps between now and the next stage of the bills proceedings i can be in touch with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> we have had an interesting debate on this subject <e> <s> we in the department recognise that after the age of which is after all the age to which the amendment refers health is likely to deteriorate in ways that might possibly affect driving and the driving licensing system takes account of the possible effects of increasing age <e> <s> from that time licences are issued for only three years and applicants are asked at regular intervals to declare any relevant medical condition including any deterioration in eyesight <e> <s> we therefore consider this amendment to be unnecessary <e>", "<cs> in some ways the debate on this amendment has been similar to the debate on the <e>", "<cs> i do not have chapter and verse on the research that has been carried out either in this country or abroad but i can assure my noble friend that it has been done and has not revealed any <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend withdraws the amendment i should like to correct the point about distances <e> <s> there are two requirements feet for characters inches high and feet for characters inches high <e> <s> so both my noble friends are right <e>", "<cs> not at this stage <e> <s> if i had been able to give my noble friend more details i should have done so <e> <s> however i shall attempt to find out and perhaps be able to place some information in the library <e>", "<cs> the purpose of clause is to ensure that all new riders receive basic training on <e>", "<cs> noble lords and others have voiced concerns over the adequacy of training facilities especially in the remoter areas of the country <e> <s> i understand that those concerns may stem partly from an audit of training facilities that the motor cycle association of great britain has carried out <e> <s> it should be borne in mind that this audit is incomplete <e> <s> many of the sites operated by star rider in remote areas are not yet included <e> <s> the picture may therefore not be as bleak as has been indicated <e>", "<cs> i shall of course look into that matter but there are complications in writing <e>", "<cs> as has been explained this amendment would place a duty on the secretary of state to make regulations concerning training <e> <s> however i do not believe that the amendment is necessary <e> <s> obviously the secretary of state will need to make regulations so as to specify certain matters for instance the content of the training course <e> <s> it may not be necessary however to make provision for all the matters listed in subsection c <e> <s> we hope for example that it will not be necessary to specify charges for training as it will be for the training groups to decide their level of charging <e> <s> but the power is there to protect would-be riders <e>", "<cs> i am puzzled as to why the noble lord lord underhill has proposed the amendment <e> <s> i can see no reason why the secretary of state should need to specify in regulations the days of the week on which training should be available <e> <s> training will be available on whatever days training groups operate <e> <s> there are over training sites throughout the country <e> <s> very many of those about per cent <e> <s> rely upon the goodwill of volunteer instructors who give up their spare time usually at weekends to pass on their enthusiasm knowledge and skill to those coming into motorcycling <e> <s> there are also many who operate purely on a commercial basis and run training courses up to seven days a week <e>", "<cs> at first glance this may appear to be a fairly reasonable amendment <e> <s> however i have to point out that if accepted it could put back the concept of compulsory training by up to years <e> <s> i am sure that is not the purpose behind the amendment of the noble lord lord underhill but that could certainly be its effect <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may point out that i said nothing about needing to overhaul marsham street or that that would take years <e> <s> this amendment would make the secretary of state responsible for the training of all motorcycle instructors and as there are of them to get them through the course at cardington would take up to years <e>", "<cs> in answer to my noble friend it is inconceivable that we should wish to specify a minimum charge for training <e> <s> if an atb wished to offer free training we would certainly not object nor would we wish to institute a flat rate charge since costs undoubtedly differ in various parts of the country <e> <s> if charges were to be specified in regulations as my noble friend points out they might not necessarily be so they would be maximum charges and therefore despite what my noble friend said i am happy to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> the committee will be aware that compulsory training is intended to replace the part i motorcycle test so that we can get away from the idea of two tests for motorcyclists <e> <s> this amendment implies that there should be a test at the end of the compulsory training course <e> <s> we do not want that <e> <s> instructors will conduct a rolling assessment of those undertaking training <e> <s> only if all elements of the course are completed to the instructors satisfaction can a certificate showing successful completion of the course be issued <e> <s> motorcycle instructors are skilled people and they will know when a rider is competent enough to be allowed to ride on the road without supervision <e> <s> we can rely upon their judgment <e> <s> therefore the amendment is unnecessary <e>", "<cs> the wording of this clause is quite deliberate <e> <s> it requires a rider to have successfully completed an approved training course before he is allowed to ride on the road unsupervised <e> <s> a rider will only have successfully completed the course if he satisfies his instructor that he has reached the standard required to be issued with a certificate <e> <s> this is already included as a requirement in the outline of the compulsory course which we are currently discussing with the training bodies <e>", "<cs> it is not quite like that <e> <s> at the end of the course which the rider attends probably a one-day course but it could be longer if he is unsuccessful he will get his certificate in which case he will then be allowed to ride unsupervised <e> <s> he must then go on to take his test <e> <s> if he wants to undertake further training he can do so and if he does not want to do so he need not <e> <s> when he takes his test the position will be as at present <e> <s> he will not in future he allowed to ride unsupervised until he has obtained his certificate and that certificate will be uniform throughout the country <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord underhill has outlined some points that i believe are worthy of consideration <e> <s> i would not wish to raise false hopes about the amendment at this stage but i wish to consider what has been said and whether there may be wider implications for the concept of exemptions from the compulsory training requirement <e> <s> if the noble lord cares to withdraw the amendment i shall undertake to consider the matter to see whether the provision for exemption is the right way to proceed <e> <s> i shall be in touch with the noble lord between now and the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for explaining so clearly the purpose of the amendment and for the amusing story that she told <e> <s> i wonder what excuse the noble lord lord jenkins of hillhead might have made for not getting into the car in the first place <e> <s> i am sure that he would not have caused offence in carrying a p-plate but that might give some difficulties to people in the future <e>", "<cs> i am not sure whether that provision is in the <e>", "<cs> yes although the noble lord said that he did not give me notice of this matter i saw his earlier amendment which was subsequently withdrawn <e> <s> i understood why that was done and we will look into the matter <e> <s> i can give the noble lord the assurance that we shall take the next available appropriate opportunity to introduce the measure <e> <s> i hope that that will not be too far away <e> <s> if we shortly have legislation on the north report that would provide an opportunity <e>", "<cs> it may be helpful if in responding to this amendment i outline the sort of systems which we envisage will need to be licensed <e>", "<cs> i certainly agree with the spirit of this amendment but i cannot accept that it is necessary <e> <s> the amendment would apply to any driver <e>", "<cs> in fact i did mention local radio stations in my reply and i would be happy to pay tribute to them <e> <s> what i was describing so far as the bbc is concerned was a new system which they are developing <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> the main effect of this amendment as the noble lord lord underhill has explained would be to provide that any trials of driver information systems should be subject to certain requirements <e> <s> they should last for not less than two years and they should be monitored by the secretary of state who would be required to consult local authority <e>", "<cs> i was just about to make a point in connection with the guidelines when my noble friend spoke <e> <s> there exists perhaps a slight misunderstanding <e> <s> those are not guidance notes they are invitations to submit proposals which would we hope form the basis of a legally binding licence between the secretary of state and the autoguide operator <e> <s> they are therefore rather more powerful than the guidelines which the noble lord lord underhill had in mind <e> <s> i shall read carefully what the noble lord lord underhill and other noble lords have said on this amendment and will bear that in mind if anything needs to be done <e>", "<cs> i am glad to have the opportunity to give an explanation as to why subsection is in the bill <e> <s> the removal of subsection would have a number of effects <e> <s> one would be to prevent different types of driver information systems from operating in the same area <e> <s> if for example an autoguide system was licensed for the london area it would not be possible then to license in london another type of system which provided a different driver information service <e>", "<cs> i think that i should look at this point <e> <s> i had not seen any difficulty until this stage with area <e> <s> the london area for instance might be granted a licence for the whole of the area within the m <e> <s> it might be split into boroughs or north or south of the thames <e> <s> however whether we need a definition of area is a matter that i shall look into <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord underhill for his explanation of this group of amendments <e> <s> i understand his concern that autoguide and similar systems should not lead to an increase in traffic on unsuitable roads or rat runs as they are often called <e> <s> we too wish to make sure that this does not happen <e> <s> it might be helpful to the committee if i explained the way in which my right honourable friend proposes to tackle the issue and exercise the licensing powers which he seeks <e>", "<cs> the purpose of paragragh c of clause is to enable the secretary of state through the licence which he will issue to operators of driver information systems to ensure that traffic is not guided onto unsuitable roads <e> <s> this paragraph together with paragraph b would enable licence conditions to be precisely tailored to the needs of particular areas <e> <s> the licence could for example specify that while an autoguide system could direct cars on to certain roads it could not direct heavy goods vehicles or as they are to be called under part i of the bill large goods vehicles on to them <e> <s> the secretary of state would be able by virtue of paragraph c to include licence conditions to the effect that vehicles or particular classes of vehicles such as lorries could use only certain roads at particular times of the day or during particular periods <e> <s> to take two examples the conditions could be used to divert through traffic away from urban area at night time or away from central london on ceremonial occasions <e>", "<cs> in regard to this part of the bill i do not believe that the government can be accused of not looking far ahead and hopefully they will not have to bring further legislation before the chamber in the near future <e>", "<cs> perhaps my noble friend will give way <e> <s> by turning to the guidelines one notes that they say that the licensee will have a pre-emptive right to a licence for a further years after the three-year period <e>", "<cs> in responding to this amendment perhaps i should start by explaining the purpose of paragraph f <e> <s> the department of transport and local highway authorities currently devote considerable resources to collecting information on patterns of vehicle movement and on monitoring traffic speeds <e> <s> the information is required to enable my right honourable friend the secretary of state to take decisions on the need for road improvements and on traffic management issues <e> <s> this information is also required by local highway authorities and for traffic research <e>", "<cs> new subsection proposed by the noble lord lord underhill would require the secretary of state to make available to the relevant highway authority any information which he acquires from the licence holder <e> <s> the information would be given to the highway authority free of charge on request <e> <s> we cannot accept this new provision <e>", "<cs> that is not quite right <e> <s> i hope that i can reassure my noble friend and the noble lord lord carmichael that the amendments are not necessary <e>", "<cs> i shall have to write to my noble friend on this issue <e> <s> it would not be our intention that other services not connected with the driver information system would be covered by this <e> <s> my noble friend mentioned the aa and the rac as promoters <e> <s> but of course gec and plessey are as well and we do not know what might be covered so it certainly is not our intention <e> <s> however i think i should write to my noble friend and clarify the situation <e>", "<cs> i shall deal with amendments nos <e> <s> and at the same time as they are identical <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lords for the explanations of these amendments <e> <s> the effect of the amendments would however be to allow the fixing of driver information system apparatus not to the poles on which traffic signs are mounted but to the signs themselves <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord will agree that in no circumstances should equipment be mounted where it might obscure a traffic sign <e>", "<cs> i cannot accept the amendment <e> <s> the noble lord will no doubt not be surprised by that <e> <s> as i said in our earlier debate at second reading we are committed to introducing legislation at a suitable opportunity to reform the public utilities street works act along the lines recommended in the horne report <e> <s> we fully accept the strength of the case for early legislation but pressures on the legislative programme make it impossible to give a commitment to any particular session <e> <s> we shall continue to seek an opportunity to introduce the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the minister can overrule or not take the advice which the inspector gives <e> <s> in this case he chose not to do so <e> <s> as i outlined in my original answer in his report the inspector took into account the importance of the battlefield <e> <s> after weighing up all the matters recommended for consideration he came down in favour of the route which was chosen <e>", "<cs> my lords because of physical-geotechnical studies made in and which showed serious ground instability south of naseby it was difficult to locate the route away from the village <e> <s> in the interests of local communities options north of naseby were explored and the northern route identified <e> <s> in the view of the department of transport that was economically and environmentally better than any viable southern route <e>", "<cs> my lords that might be the case if the proposed road crossed the main part of the battlefield which it does not <e> <s> it probably crosses a part of the line of prince ruperts charge but not the ground on which the main bodies of the two armies were engaged <e> <s> certainly i can show my noble friend a map to prove that point <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i cannot accept that my lords <e> <s> as i have outlined the damage done to the battlefield is not that serious <e> <s> the damage that would have resulted had the other route been chosen would have upset a number of communities <e> <s> i think it worth pointing out that the northamptonshire county council the daventry district council and the parish councils of cold ashby and haslebech which are the areas affected all opposed the southern route and approved the departments route <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer the last part of my noble and learned friends question except to say that i understand that oliver cromwell was in favour of parliamentary procedures <e> <s> this route was chosen by two democratically elected secretaries of state following laws which have been laid down by parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of that fact <e> <s> i could not be expected to be aware of it in view of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend has a far greater knowledge of oliver cromwell than i have <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with my noble friend <e> <s> this battle has been fought over a number of years and has included two cases brought before the courts both of which were found in favour of the route chosen by the secretaries of state <e> <s> therefore i think it is time to get on and build the road <e>", "<cs> my lords it all depends on whether you believe in ghosts <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the cost of tunnelling under this particular section would be disproportionate to the benefits achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords possibly but at this battlefield there are no remains of the battle to see <e> <s> it looks like an ordinary field so far as i am aware <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that agreement has yet been reached between the parties on the future arrangements for approach control and ground movement control services at baas scottish airports <e> <s> i understand that the air traffic controllers concerned voted against a transfer of these services in a recent ballot <e>", "<cs> my lords clearly any transfer of responsibility will have to he carefully planned and carried out on the basis of agreed terms <e> <s> the agreement would have to make proper provision for future manning including engineering staff <e> <s> maintenance of safety standards would be the overriding consideration <e> <s> the services would not be licensed if they were not up to scratch <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i think there is no reason to suppose that it is not <e>", "<cs> my lords one needs to understand that what is at stake here is only the approach and aerodrome navigation services not the en route traffic control services <e> <s> i take issue with the noble lord that we do not want any competition in this area <e> <s> there is competition as such at the moment <e> <s> not all airports use the national air traffic services for example luton and east midlands <e> <s> i do not believe that anybody is saying they are unsafe <e> <s> they use independent or private air traffic controllers but all staff have to be licensed under the caa safety regulations group <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a question for the caa and the baa to discuss <e> <s> it is not for the government to interfere <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the proposals involve a transfer of staff from the national air traffic services to the baa so the same people would be involved <e> <s> those were the proposals which were turned down in the ballot by the staff <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> it is a matter between the caa and the baa <e>", "<cs> certainly my lords <e> <s> both parties have kept us informed up to now of their discussions and they will continue to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord harris for providing the house with an opportunity to debate this important subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express my thanks to my noble friend lord strathclyde for taking the bill through second reading at such short notice while i was unavoidably absent <e> <s> i should also like to thank other noble lords for their support of this most useful measure <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised that the noble lord says that the company does not know what it has been asked to do <e> <s> it has already produced a preliminary report and we expect the full report to be produced in a few months time <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is aware of the four london assessment studies covering different areas of london and the improvements that might or might not be made in those areas <e> <s> this present study is very much supplemental to those <e> <s> it is using brand new technology and has not previously been tried on this scale <e> <s> we feel that it might be useful but we shall not know until we have the information produced <e> <s> having obtained that it will be a question of whether it can be integrated into the other assessment studies <e> <s> it is not separate from them <e>", "<cs> my lords we are straying somewhat from the question on the order paper which relates purely to this study being carried out by one company <e> <s> however in general terms i believe i answered a question on this subject not long ago <e> <s> we have had single authorities in the past <e> <s> they have not produced an integrated london transport policy and we do not want to repeat those mistakes <e>", "<cs> my lords i sympathise with the noble earl but no this study is to discover <e>", "<cs> my lords in his original question the noble lord asked me what policies are set for the model to test <e> <s> i replied to that question <e> <s> i do not believe that there is anything that i can add to that now <e>", "<cs> i should like to begin by making a few general remarks about part of the bill and the governments broad approach to the supervision of auditors which i think follow on from the remarks made by the noble lord lord williams of elvel <e> <s> this is partly because in a bill which covers such a wide range of matters it is useful to get ones <e>", "<cs> i am not certain that i can answer that question straight away <e> <s> i suspect that the circumstances are different <e> <s> the company auditor in amendment no <e> <s> does not refer to a specific appointment whereas amendment no <e> <s> does <e> <s> i hope that that answers the noble lords point <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is right to say that paragraph of schedule needs to be amended so that the majority of voting rights in a partnership are held by individuals who hold an appropriate qualification or firms which would be eligible for appointment as a company auditor <e> <s> however the amendments tabled by the noble lord are not quite right as they give no definition of the meaning of voting rights in a partnership <e>", "<cs> we have had an interesting debate on this subject it is not that i did not wish to reply earlier but many noble lords wanted to take part <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord williams for some of the remarks he had made <e>", "<cs> we covered the point that the noble lord was making on the first amendment dealt with this afternoon <e> <s> in my reply to that amendment i outlined the reasons why we have to do that in order to come into line with the directive which the noble lord lord williams reinforced just now <e>", "<cs> i mentioned the system of peer review <e> <s> we are aware that that is sometimes seen as a bureaucratic and costly system of reviewing a firms work <e> <s> however we do not believe that paragraph requires a system on those lines <e> <s> as i have said we would be happy to discuss with the profession its ideas on a possibly less onerous system <e> <s> having said that if the profession came back to us and said that it wanted the peer review system we would not rule it out <e> <s> it is not necessary however to use that method <e>", "<cs> i have volunteered consultations on the way that monitoring takes place <e> <s> however i have not at all said that we will reconsider whether any kind of monitoring should take place <e> <s> i make that crystal clear to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran and to other members of the committee <e> <s> the consultations with the representative bodies will concern how monitoring can be conducted <e> <s> i doubt whether any change would need to be made in the schedule <e> <s> the text we have permits a range of outcomes which i hope will be acceptable to the profession <e> <s> i cannot at the moment see any need for a change in the schedule <e>", "<cs> i think that in considering the present requirements in the bill relating to practical training one has to bear in mind the purposes of the supervisory system <e> <s> the system is about ensuring that company auditors are properly trained and equipped for their role arid that they are subject to appropriate rules on such matters as integrity and independence once qualified <e> <s> it is not about accountancy in a wider sense and it will be quite open for persons to qualify as for example chartered accountants without meeting all the criteria in the bill <e>", "<cs> first i should like to answer the point made by the noble lord lord williams before i turn to the main substance of this amendment <e> <s> the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> that is a new point not covered by the amendments i think i am right in saying <e> <s> therefore we would have to give consideration to it <e> <s> i undertake to give consideration obviously without commitment at this stage as to whether it is a good thing or not <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that there is a great deal i can add <e> <s> on the question of appeal we think that formal appeal procedures would become bureaucratic and that united kingdom nationals would not necessarily benefit from comparable arrangements overseas <e> <s> however this is not a fundamental sticking point <e> <s> i have already said to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran that we shall look at this appeal procedure in the light of the discussion we have had <e>", "<cs> i understand the noble lords point about clarification <e> <s> however in framing any particular law we must remember that the law is a seamless web <e> <s> if we so to speak clarify the law here we potentially call into question provisions made elsewhere which are intended to have the same effect that a secretary of states discretion be exercised reasonably but which do not contain the clarification <e> <s> such a calling into question <e> <s> i submit would become undesirable <e> <s> however as i have said i have agreed to look at this point and i honestly do not feel i can go any further <e>", "<cs> the noble lords amendment would substitute the word listed for quoted in relation to the shares of an unquoted company or its parent or subsidiary <e> <s> i appreciate that listed is the more modern term but i fear that the noble lords terminology has the effect of extending the number of companies that persons retaining a act authorisation may audit <e> <s> that is because if the noble lords amendment were accepted they would be able to audit firms quoted on for example the unlisted securities market <e>", "<cs> our purpose in providing that the responsibility to maintain the register should be a joint one was to ensure that the responsibility was properly discharged <e> <s> article of the directive requires the names and addresses of persons who are eligible for appointment as auditors to be available to the public <e> <s> it seems to us that to meet that requirement a person should be able at least to go to one place and be shown there a complete list of eligible persons <e> <s> that objective obviously becomes more difficult in circumstances in which naturally enough there may be more than one recognised supervisory body but we do not wish to create a further tier of bureaucratic responsibility just for the register <e> <s> we therefore intend that the bodies should be under a joint responsibility to maintain a single centralised register <e> <s> we believe that recognised bodies should be capable of so organising themselves <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran indicated this clause supplements clause <e> <s> that clause enables the secretary of state to require a recognised supervisory or qualifying body to provide on a regular basis or in relation to predetermined events information which he may reasonably require for the exercise of his functions under this part of the bill <e> <s> this power could be used to require notification of the occurrence of specific events for example perhaps a change in the curriculum for a training course or it could be used to require periodic reports on for example the operation of the disciplinary proceedings <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> would not seem to have the effect that the noble lord seeks in that new section a of the companies act which is inserted by clause of the present bill appears to require the signature on the audit report to be that of the individual auditor responsible <e> <s> however i am sympathetic to the noble lords point that auditors should be able to sign the name of their firm on company audit reports <e> <s> we shall be making a suitable amendment to clause at a later stage of the bills passage and shall deal with the consequential amendment in clause at the same time <e>", "<cs> i have a good deal of sympathy for the noble lords comments on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> on reflection we agree that the penalty in the clause is excessive <e> <s> however rather than leave the offence in the domain of the criminal law as the noble lords amendment would still do we propose to take it out of that sphere and instead place a requirement on recognised supervisory bodies that they have rules for securing that auditors use the description registered auditor when signing company audit reports <e> <s> breach of these rules would then be a matter for the bodys disciplinary procedures <e>", "<cs> i have listened very carefully to the points raised from all sides of the committee and a number of good points were made in support of the case for conferring immunity from liability in damages on recognised supervisory bodies <e> <s> if regulation is to be effective regulators need to be able to move swiftly and decisively sometimes on less than conclusive evidence if it seems necessary to do so <e> <s> however their financial resources will often be smaller than those of people affected by their actions and there may be a risk that the prospect of large claims for damages would deter a regulator from taking the actions it believes to be necessary <e>", "<cs> we have now reached the agreed stage on the bill and therefore i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for having given me notice of the two stations to which he referred otherwise i would not be in a position to answer his supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole purpose of introducing the new clocks is to improve punctuality <e> <s> it will be easier for drivers to see the clocks and it is to be hoped for the trains to run on time <e>", "<cs> my lords though that question strays somewhat from the main question i think i can give the noble lord the assurance that he seeks <e>", "<cs> my lords we plan to spend nearly billion over the next three years on building and improving motorways and trunk roads <e> <s> this represents an increase of per cent <e> <s> on our spending in the previous three years to march <e> <s> another billion will be spent on road maintenance <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the m extension all sections are under construction except that between waterstock and wendlebury <e> <s> the inspectors report on that section is with the department and a decision is expected soon <e>", "<cs> my lords that is quite another question <e> <s> but i can tell the right reverend prelate that i believe real investment in railways is at its highest ever level in recent years <e>", "<cs> my lords there are various schemes in hand that may help my noble friend <e> <s> i cannot refer to each of them individually in this answer <e> <s> i refer noble lords to the last white paper that was published in the spring of <e> <s> i expect that we shall be publishing a new one fairly shortly as we usually do so about every two years <e> <s> that gives details of all the schemes in the programme <e> <s> since the last white paper there have been schemes added <e>", "<cs> my lords i take note of what my noble friend says <e> <s> it is a matter for the treasury <e> <s> i shall draw my noble friends remarks to the attention of my right honourable friend the chancellor <e>", "<cs> my lords bypasses are under construction at the moment out of a total of in the programme at this stage <e> <s> that is good news <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned the backlog of repairs <e> <s> i quoted a figure of billion for repairs over the next three years <e> <s> it remains our aim to eliminate the backlog by <e> <s> i cannot give an answer on local roads because the question refers only to roads for which the department is responsible <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be unwise for me to discriminate between different areas <e> <s> every area of the country reckons to have a claim on resources <e> <s> my noble friend is concerned with his area <e> <s> others would argue that their claims are just as good <e> <s> i hope my noble friend will be encouraged by the overall figure that i have been able to give this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise the genuine reasons that have prompted my noble friends to put down this amendment <e> <s> we are all agreed that the problems they have in mind will disappear when the new licensing system comes into force on st january <e> <s> the question is whether something should be done in advance of the introduction of the new system <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a fascinating debate on this subject which has ranged further afield than eyesight standards <e> <s> during the committee stage i undertook to place the available research in the library of the house <e> <s> that has already been referred to on a previous amendment <e> <s> copies of that research have been placed in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords the mandatory p-plate scheme which this amendment proposes is based on the restricted probationary scheme the r-plate in force in northern ireland <e> <s> in committee my noble friend lord brookeborough spoke in favour of that scheme explaining as he has again today that the royal ulster constabulary strongly supports it <e> <s> while i appreciate that my noble friend lady gardner of parkes and my noble friend lord brookeborough in supporting the amendment indeed all those who have spoken in support of it are concerned to see a reduction in road accident casualties there is unfortunately no evidence that such schemes have that effect <e> <s> i say unfortunately because if we thought that there was any real chance <e>", "<cs> my lords to cover the noble lords first point i said in my speech that as well as exemptions for the islands to which i referred in the main part of my speech we could also provide exemptions in the sort of circumstances that he mentioned in committee <e> <s> i hope that that covers that point <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord carmichael has explained this amendment seeks to give the secretary of state power to provide in regulations for a formal appeals procedure for any motorcycle trainees who are unsuccessful on their compulsory training course <e> <s> i am afraid that i cannot accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord decides what he wishes to do perhaps i may make these further points <e> <s> first part i of the present motor-cycle test is conducted on the departments behalf by training bodies <e> <s> they will be <e>", "<cs> my lords much has been made of the fact that our detailed proposals for the operation of autoguide are contained in guidelines rather than in the bill <e> <s> i suspect that there may be some misunderstanding about the status of the guidelines and it may be helpful if i take this opportunity to try to clarify the position <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord underhill for explaining the purpose behind these amendments <e> <s> i fear however that we cannot accept them <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord underhill has explained this amendment would make the granting of a licence under part ii of the bill conditional on the prospective operator and relevant local highway authorities reaching agreement on the exchange of information <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps the noble lord will forgive me for intervening <e> <s> i did not say that <e> <s> i said that there were local authorities which were firmly opposed to the governments policies <e> <s> i did not say that they were opposed to this particular system <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for explaining the purpose behind these amendments <e> <s> as he is aware i wrote to him following the committee stage to explain why i thought that these changes to clause were unnecessary <e> <s> i hope therefore that he will forgive me if for the benefit of other noble lords i rehearse the reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully appreciate the concern that has motivated this amendment <e> <s> however i believe that the amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> i do not believe that the proposal would necessarily achieve the desired result <e> <s> noble lords may not be aware that the police national computer record does not hold details of all convictions <e> <s> generally speaking the pnc holds details only of convictions of people who have been convicted since for the first time for an offence which can lead to a sentence of imprisonment <e> <s> very many convictions therefore are not held on the pnc including those for a number of offences that i am sure the noble lord will attempt to identify <e> <s> the responsibility for disclosure of information from police records including those held on the pnc rests with individual chief police officers <e> <s> any new arrangements for disclosure would have to be negotiated with them <e> <s> access to police records by traffic commissioners would have serious implications for the rights of the individual and the data protection and rehabilitation of offenders legislation would also have to be considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord is right <e> <s> i was giving just one example <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise <e> <s> i must have overlooked the point that the noble lord raised on the last occasion <e> <s> i therefore have not come armed with the information this afternoon <e> <s> i shall look into the matter as soon as i possibly can <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> there was general consensus in the council that the community should support the work of those organisations but without duplicating their effort <e> <s> the proposals which were put forward by the commission are generally supportive of the role of eurocontrol but envisage rather greater community involvement including community adherence to the eurocontrol convention the establishment of a consultative committee on air traffic control and community involvement in air transport infrastructure <e> <s> i hope that aviation matters will come before the council in march but as i said that depends upon progress at official level <e>", "<cs> my lords we should welcome a sense of urgency on the part of the commission on this and various other matters in which we are also interested particularly in the aviation field <e> <s> as i have said there was general consensus in the council that efforts in regard to air traffic control should be concentrated through icao and eurocontrol and that the commissions role should be limited <e>", "<cs> my lords the latest position is that it was agreed that further proposals for liberalisation should be brought forward by the commission by november of this year to come into effect in june <e> <s> we are anxious to see what proposals the commission brings forward in november and we ourselves shall shortly begin to lobby strenuously on that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said on several occasions we believe that eurocontrol and icao should take the lead in this matter <e> <s> the commissions involvement should i believe be limited <e> <s> we do not believe that there is a significant role for it <e> <s> the most valuable contribution which the commission could make would be in funding research and development through eurocontrol <e>", "<cs> my lords in the fourth quarter of output per head in manufacturing <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a tribute to both the workforce and management and indeed to government policy over the past nine years <e>", "<cs> my lords this question refers to productivity but manufacturing output has grown strongly by an average of per cent <e> <s> a year over the past five years while productivity has grown at an average rate of over per cent <e> <s> over the same period so the story is not so bleak <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a tricky matter to assess as comparisons of levels across countries are difficult to make <e> <s> one can certainly say that the united kingdoms growth in productivity has been faster than that of our competitors but even if we are at a lower level that provides further scope for industry to continue to improve its performance even further <e>", "<cs> my lords we have been through three stages since <e> <s> the first stage was recession where there was substantial labour shedding <e> <s> the second stage between and was economic recovery where output started to recover slowly but employment continued to decline significantly as industry made further efficiency gains <e> <s> over the past five years we have had sustained <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that it was difficult to compare levels of productivity but one can compare growth relatively easily <e> <s> one can make comparisons on the basis of figures produced by the oecd on which the figures that i have quoted are based but it is all to the good if we have further scope for improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very different question <e> <s> interest rates are a subject on their own <e> <s> i have no doubt that they will not be held high any longer than is necessary to combat inflation which is by far the worse evil <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not yet had an opportunity to read the report of yesterdays debate but i am sure that the noble lord makes a good point <e> <s> i am glad that he welcomes those figures because from some of the questions that we receive we wonder whether they are welcomed throughout the house <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a hypothetical point but as i said earlier i am glad that there is still further scope for industry to improve its performance <e> <s> the noble lord referred to the s and s <e> <s> i shall merely point out that between and our productivity growth was the lowest of the g countries <e> <s> since then it has been the highest even including japan and the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords i have now attempted to answer the first part of my noble friends question on three occasions <e> <s> i do not think that there is any more than i can say on it <e> <s> it may well be the case that in one of those years or productivity was as high as per cent <e> <s> the fact is that the average annual growth rate over those years was per cent <e> <s> and we were bottom of the league <e> <s> it is now about per cent <e> <s> and we are at the top <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord will acknowledge that we have done much to reduce unemployment <e> <s> i understand that it has today come down to under two million for the first time in a considerable period <e> <s> we shall continue to pursue the policies which bring that rate even further down <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree with my noble friend <e> <s> i said earlier that i was glad that these figures were welcome in at least some quarters in your lordships house <e> <s> the fact is that we have had a very remarkable record of economic growth over the past few years <e> <s> i hope that it can continue <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i was wrong to allow myself to stray from the question on the order paper which was about manufacturing productivity <e> <s> i have tried to answer a number of questions as best i can <e> <s> the trade deficit is of course yet another <e> <s> as i have said we hope that the trade deficit will reduce <e> <s> one way of helping with that reduction is of course for manufacturing productivity to increase <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that the idea is attractive in principle but unfortunately the rules of government accounting would not allow the department to divert revenue away from the consolidated fund and use it as a covert grant in aid <e> <s> the department is however investigating alternative approaches to make the sales attractive and that will form part of the announcement in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords this issue is already before my right honourable friend <e> <s> he is well aware of the concerns that have been expressed by motability and the suggestions made by it <e> <s> we have considered this and as i have said we are still investigating alternative approaches <e> <s> i should point out that the government already support organisations such as motability <e> <s> my departments mobility advice and vehicle information service dealt with over inquiries last year from disabled drivers and again this year we shall be running the mobility road show <e> <s> we also exempt disabled people from having to pay vehicle excise duty <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said we are talking here of selling taxpayers and government assets and therefore we have to abide by the rules <e> <s> the advertisements for number plate sales which one sees in the newspapers are not affected by the proposals at all <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very different question from the one on the order paper which is about our proposals for selling cherished number plates <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord is well aware of the rules which concern government accounting <e>", "<cs> my lords that is very easy to define <e> <s> it is a number plate that is cherished by somebody and for which somebody is prepared to pay a price <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for having informed me of the particular station which she had in mind <e> <s> it is a listed building and any question of alteration to it will be at first for british rail to sort out with the local planning authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i can answer the first part of the noble lords question in that british rail currently have around listed buildings which i believe makes them one of the largest single owners of listed buildings in the country <e> <s> i cannot say whether there are any particularly large projects in hand which affect any other listed buildings at the moment but if there were they would have to go through the normal procedure applicable to listed building legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i have said that british rail have to go through the proper planning procedures if they want to demolish the building <e> <s> that involves going to the local planning authority in the same way as any other owner of a listed building would have to do for such proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter for british rail <e> <s> in this case i understand that the station itself is being sold to the people whom my noble friend lady strange and others support <e> <s> it is the platform and the footbridge which are in question at the moment <e> <s> british rail want to make the alterations because there is a drainage problem between the tracks <e> <s> british rail have a genuine reason for wanting to carry out that work and not just for the sake of it <e> <s> as i said the question is one for the planning authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly cannot give the noble baroness the assurance she seeks <e> <s> if there is a bill before parliament it is for parliament to decide how to deal with it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry i did not catch the name of the station <e>", "<cs> my lords without notice i am afraid cannot give details for all the many stations which british rail own <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of that but it is an interesting point <e>", "<cs> my lords progress is being made on implementing the many safety measures recommended in the report <e> <s> london underground has set aside million to be spent over the next three years in doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot be specific about improvements to the circle line <e> <s> however if the noble baroness cares to look at the central london rail study she will see that the proposed new lines will alleviate congestion on certain parts of that line <e> <s> a large programme of investment is now being carried out on the whole underground system <e> <s> if the proposals contained in the study are carried out there will be further investment of billion on both network southeast and the underground <e>", "<cs> my lords the new lines are needed because of steeply rising traffic levels which we expect will rise further <e> <s> therefore the first source of finance is from those who will benefit from the schemes <e> <s> in the main those are passengers but there are also the developers who stand to gain from increased land values <e> <s> however a government grant is available if needed to make projects viable and if justified by benefits such as relief of road congestion <e>", "<cs> my lords we are aware that escalators are a current problem <e> <s> however that is partly due to carrying out the safety recommendation contained in the kings cross report that all wooden parts must be renewed <e>", "<cs> it is no good the noble lord saying rubbish <e> <s> it is true it is now being carried out <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that both parts will be carried out as quickly as possible <e> <s> the first part is the major upgrading programme costing billion <e> <s> i hope that it will be carried out speedily <e>", "<cs> my lords a large programme of investment is now being carried out part of it the renewal of escalators <e> <s> these are not easy to repair or renew quickly because the system must remain open <e> <s> i believe that the authorities are doing their best although i agree that the situation is not entirely satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an interesting question <e> <s> there are plans to increase the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of the situation at individual stations <e> <s> however since the noble lord raised the matter a few weeks ago i understand that a representative of london underground has been in touch with him <e> <s> i hope that the situation will be corrected as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords no not at all <e> <s> there is not much point in using a model if it does not reflect the policies which the government are adopting because the results of the work are likely to be of no great value <e> <s> as i said in my original answer we commissioned an independent audit of the model which threw up a number of failures in it including for instance the prediction that subsidies would rise between and when of course they actually fell <e> <s> so i am afraid that it is not a very good model on which to base future projections <e>", "<cs> my lords it still exists <e> <s> it is a not very large computer disk sitting on somebodys desk <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should have said earlier that the audit to which i referred in my original answer and which was produced for us by the external consultants is available in the library <e> <s> it is public knowledge and noble lords may wish to consult it <e> <s> no doubt the noble lord will wish to read it to see what it said <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> my answer looks rather further forward than next year <e> <s> i am pleased to be able to tell the house that the new computer to be installed has <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to make too firm a prediction at this stage but i very much hope that there will be some improvement <e> <s> the caa and national air traffic services have made proposals for small improvements this summer and a number of european initiatives should also come to fruition <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only reaffirm that it remains our policy to stop inflation <e> <s> as for new policies i believe that given time the tight monetary and high interest rate policies currently being pursued will bear down on inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords the policy of high interest rates obviously takes a little time to work through the system <e> <s> it is hoped that such policies will effectively reduce the rate of inflation <e> <s> even outside forecasters all appear to think that inflation will fall during this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot agree with the noble lord at all <e> <s> there may be the illusion with inflation that people are enjoying high salaries or wage rises but when they work out what it does to savings and other such matters they see that it is very damaging <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord compares the present position with that under the previous government <e> <s> i simply remind the house that the present rate of inflation in this country is less than half that enjoyed as an average under the labour government between and <e> <s> the noble lord says that inflation rose during the first year or so of this governments term of office but that rise followed the tax changes which increased vat and reduced income tax <e> <s> if he looks at the tax and prices index for that period rather than the rpi he will see a different picture <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully recognise that when the government came to power in various radical measures had to be taken to halt the decline from which we had been suffering in the previous five years <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble and learned friend is right <e> <s> we should nevertheless like to achieve a situation where the value of money runs down the very minimum amount if possible not at all <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to join other noble lords in congratulating the noble and learned lord lord oliver of aylmerton on a very good maiden speech and to say that the government are grateful to him to his noble and learned colleagues on the law and institutions sub-committee and to the european communities committee for bringing to the attention of the house the important questions raised by the european commissions proposal <e> <s> i join other noble lords in acknowledging the work of its chairman the noble and learned lord lord goff of chieveley <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has asked me a number of questions <e> <s> it is impossible to say whether membership of the erm would prevent sterling fluctuations in the market <e> <s> countries within the erm engage in realignments from time to time and erm membership has no <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend makes some good points <e> <s> there is very little that i can add to what i said in my original answer which is that we still intend to join the erm when the time is right <e>", "<cs> my lords i confess that i am somewhat surprised <e> <s> that is the first time from the benches opposite that i have heard those kinds of figures quoted at us over here <e> <s> i am very pleased that the noble lord should choose to do so <e> <s> i would not know whether membership of the erm has much bearing on those figures but it is very encouraging to hear good news relayed back from the benches opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not say that he holds a totally contrary opinion <e> <s> sir leon is entitled to his own views <e> <s> in his speech he said that he felt the time was now very right indeed <e> <s> what i have said at question time on innumerable occasions in this house is that we shall join when the time is right <e> <s> it is purely a matter of timing <e>", "<cs> my lords what i said was that we would join when the time was right <e> <s> perhaps we disagree slightly about the timing <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the noble lords interest in this matter <e> <s> the problem of course is that if one were to declare the exact circumstances that made the time right that would possibly give rise to difficulties in the markets <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot necessarily see a connection between our agricultural problems and membership of the exchange rate mechanism <e> <s> my noble friend will no doubt have the opportunity of pointing out the connection <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we appreciate the importance of a stable exchange rate but our overriding priority is to maintain an anti-inflationary stance <e> <s> we are not willing to see sterling depreciate which would only add to inflationary pressures which would be even more damaging to british industry <e>", "<cs> my lords the government will not allow the exchange rate to depreciate to accommodate inflationary pressures <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first point of the noble baroness i understand that the baa does not propose to bring in any of the new charges pending the findings of the office of fair trading <e> <s> i am aware of the scale of charges proposed <e> <s> that is a matter for the baa in the first place but it is now for the oft to decide whether it should investigate <e>", "<cs> my lords without reference to the act i am not sure that i can confirm that position <e> <s> however the airports act opened up the industry to the competition legislation of the fair trading act and the competition act to which the industry was not subject before the act <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as concerns baa exploiting its position we are satisfied that the provisions for economic regulation in the airports act are sufficiently vigorous <e> <s> they are subject to five-yearly reviews by the mmc on a wide range of the airports business <e> <s> that would encompass charging the proposed charges for coaches <e> <s> duty free is a commercial decision for baa <e> <s> i understand that its policy requires a saving of at least per cent <e> <s> on average uk high street prices <e> <s> duty free of course is a discretionary purchase on the part of the customer <e>", "<cs> my lords the airports act opened up the industry to competition legislation and made the fair trading act and the competition act applicable to it which it was not before <e> <s> it is under those acts that this reference was made <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot say i am afraid <e> <s> that is in the hands of the office of fair trading and is not a matter in which i can intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that the civil aviation authority has referred this matter to the office of fair trading <e> <s> as i said in my original answer the bus and coach council asked for this to be looked at <e> <s> if i am wrong i shall write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords british rail has had quite detailed environmental assessments carried out by consultants and the route which they have now announced was heavily influenced both by these assessments and by the environmental criteria established by kent county council <e> <s> they have also taken into account the estimated costs of different routes and different levels of environmental treatment <e> <s> british rail estimates that the costs of environmental protection on the chosen route amount to some million or per cent <e> <s> of the total costs of the project <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the noble lord the assurance that he seeks that a full <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments view is clear <e> <s> it is that the route should be financed by its users <e> <s> if they happen to come from north of london they must share the proportion of the cost <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give my noble friend the assurance that he seeks <e> <s> at question time on th march my right honourable friend the prime minister said <e>", "<cs> my lords yes the first part of the route from london will be underground <e> <s> noble lords may have received a copy of british rails proposals for the channel tunnel rail link <e> <s> if my noble friend has not received a copy i shall ensure that he does so <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that the whole of the link in london would be underground <e> <s> i urge the noble lord lord annan to look at the proposals put forward by british rail <e> <s> when the bill comes before parliament there will be an opportunity for all such matters to be discussed and petitions to be dealt with <e>", "<cs> my lords no i was referring to the new link to kings cross <e> <s> i urge the noble lord to look at the maps and see what they show rather than my trying to explain them in this house at question time <e>", "<cs> my lords no i cannot give that assurance because i do not know whether it will be destroyed under the procedure <e> <s> i cannot be an expert on every mile of the track <e> <s> however when the bill comes before parliament there will be an opportunity to examine all such issues <e>", "<cs> my lords i imagine that anything can be considered when the bill goes through parliament <e> <s> however it remains the governments view that the user should pay <e> <s> they will need to be convinced that the link is a viable concern before british rail receives the go-ahead to submit a bill <e>", "<cs> my lords no i cannot agree with that suggestion <e> <s> i believe that to have a wide choice of routes would be a recipe for disaster and on that basis the bill would stand no chance <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord underhill and to my noble friends for their reception of these amendments <e> <s> if one counts up it has taken some amendments to achieve the object of the exercise <e> <s> my noble friend attempted to achieve that objective in one amendment at a previous stage of the bill <e> <s> my officials will be very grateful for the words which have been expressed about their having done that <e> <s> i believe the provision will improve the situation <e> <s> as i said we intend to introduce it as soon as possible once the bill receives royal assent <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord underhill for explaining the purpose of this amendment <e> <s> as he says we have debated before the issue of consultation with the local highway authorities on the introduction of autoguide and other driver information systems <e> <s> as he explained the amendment would enable the secretary of state to make regulations in relation to the granting of an operators licence <e> <s> paragraph a of the proposed subsection would enable the regulations to cover consultations between the operator and relevant highway and police authorities <e> <s> paragraph b would provide for similar consultations by the secretary of state <e> <s> both those provisions are unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to noble lords who have spoken on the motion that the bill do now pass <e> <s> i say briefly because the hour is now rather later than we expected that the noble lord lord underhill pressed us to legislate on the home report <e> <s> i hope as well that we shall be able to do so before too long <e>", "<cs> my lords the traffic distribution rules for prestwick date back many years originally in fact to <e> <s> they were looked at again in and again in and in the white paper we said that they would be reviewed this year if the airport did not show a steady improvement in its financial results <e> <s> baa has asked for such a review and therefore as i said in my original answer we are considering whether it should take place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certainly aware of the feeling both ways in scotland <e> <s> since baa asked for the review we have had representations from a great many people some arguing for the retention of the traffic distribution rule and some asking for it to be swept away <e> <s> obviously we shall have to take those matters into consideration in consultation with the scottish office when we make our decision <e> <s> regarding landing charges they are obviously more expensive at prestwick because it is not well used and the airport has to cover its costs <e> <s> of course it is limited by various international rules so that it cannot overcharge <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware that prestwick has an excellent weather record and <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate my noble friends point <e> <s> that is why baa has asked for a review <e> <s> at the moment the rules say that all transcontinental traffic must pass through prestwick and not go directly to glasgow or edinburgh <e> <s> that is why baa has asked for a review and that is why we are currently considering whether or not to have a review <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier feelings in scotland run high on this issue the noble lord lord carmichael said they were extremely strong <e> <s> therefore in deciding whether to have a review we are consulting the scottish office and will make our decision fairly shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords peterhead maritime rescue subcentre took no part in the piper alpha incident except to assist with message distribution a task which could have been done by any other station <e> <s> aberdeen maritime rescue co-ordination centre co-ordinates all major and oil related incidents off the east coast of scotland <e> <s> the closure of peterhead will allow some strengthening at aberdeen which will be the best manned station in the united kingdom apart from dover <e> <s> if the piper alpha inquiry should make any recommendations about the co-ordination of search and rescue they will be given the most urgent consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords am afraid i have to disagree with my noble friend <e> <s> as i said in my original answer all that peterhead did during the piper alpha incident wasto relay a number of messages which could have been done by any other coastguard station <e> <s> therefore we remain convinced that aberdeen will in fact with a greater number of people there be in an even better position to deal with major incidents such as that which occurred on piper alpha <e>", "<cs> my lords first we do not accept that it is a major decision so far as the piper alpha inquiry is concerned <e> <s> as i said in my original answer all that peterhead did was to assist with message distribution which is a task that could have been done by other coastguard stations <e> <s> peterhead and aberdeen are only miles apart which is much closer than most coastguard stations <e> <s> the flank stations will in future be forth and pentland which can assist in a similar way <e> <s> therefore i simply do not accept that it would be right to change our decision <e> <s> all the arrangements for the closure have been made <e> <s> six extra staff are going to aberdeen of whom four will be transferring from peterhead <e> <s> peterhead will remain as a sector office <e> <s> a person will be in the existing building so there will still be facilities for co-ordination with the local people <e>", "<cs> my lords i perhaps disagree that most sensible people think that should be the case <e> <s> we have obviously looked into this matter extremely carefully and have made our decision <e> <s> if the inquiry recommends any changes in the coastguard structure in north-east scotland we will of course give them full consideration <e> <s> however that does not necessarily mean that peterhead coastguard station has to be kept open <e>", "<cs> my lords the government announced their proposals to reform road traffic law in the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot go very much further in saying what legislation will or will not be announced in the normal way in the queens speech for the next session <e> <s> however i re-affirm that the government are determined to improve road safety and that we are committed to cutting road casualties especially those involving death or serious injury by one-third by the year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to disappoint the noble lord but i cannot go further than i have already <e> <s> the governments plans for legislation will be announced in the normal way in the queens speech <e> <s> i appreciate that the noble lord would like us to get on and legislate on this matter as he would on the horne report as he has so often told me <e> <s> i hope that that legislation will come forward speedily too but there is competition for legislative space and we must wait to see what happens <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only draw my noble friends remarks to the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house probably take a different view as to what is unpopular and irrelevant so i regret that i cannot give the undertaking that the noble lord seeks <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a slightly different question to whether or not we intend to introduce legislation <e> <s> enforcement is a matter for the police <e> <s> obviously we in the department of transport very much hope that the rules we make are enforced and obeyed <e> <s> the noble lord may not be aware that my noble friend lord brougham and vaux has succeeded in the ballot for a debate on this subject to be held on wednesday th april <e> <s> i am delighted about that and i am sure it will be an interesting debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend the leader of the house has noted my noble friends views <e>", "<cs> my lords of course it is for the presidency to draw up the agenda for a formal council and there is no obligation on its part to agree to substantive discussion on any particular item <e> <s> we are making progress on aviation matters outside formal council meetings <e> <s> we are pressing for further liberalisation in aviation matters and we have sent the commission a paper setting out our objectives for a copy of which i have sent to the noble baroness and i have placed a copy in the library <e> <s> as i said it is our intention to discuss aviation matters at the june council but the house will appreciate that there are other transport matters which have to be discussed at the council of ministers <e>", "<cs> my lords i dispute with the noble baroness that the british government give aviation a low priority <e> <s> we were at the forefront of negotiating the first stage of the european liberalisation package which was agreed to <e> <s> one matter which was agreed there was that there should be a second stage in the middle of next year and that proposals should be put forward by the commission in november <e> <s> we anxiously await the commissions proposals and as i said we have made our views known <e> <s> we would not expect them to be discussed before then <e> <s> there are other issues which have to be dealt with in the council including issues very important to this country for example <e> <s> lorry weights <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i have seen the report on transport by the select committee in another place which was issued at oclock this morning <e> <s> that contains a large number of recommendations to which i do not intend to try to reply this afternoon even if that were the appropriate way to reply to a select committee report from another place <e> <s> however we appreciate that the problem of air space congestion is serious and that is why we are tackling that as best we can through eurocontrol and icao <e> <s> however as i said on previous occasions it remains the case that we are not fully persuaded that the european commission has much of a role to play in that <e>", "<cs> my lords i gave the date in my original answer <e> <s> the meeting is on th and th june and i understand that the presidency has allocated th june for aviation matters <e>", "<cs> my lords british rail makes safety its first and highest priority <e> <s> it would not reduce staff numbers if that were compromised <e>", "<cs> my lords overtime is a management matter for british rail <e> <s> it is obviously being carefully considered as the noble lord said by the accident inquiries now taking place and it would be wrong to speculate on the inquiries conclusions in advance <e> <s> i understand that british rail is considering a range of measures to encourage recruitment and the retention of staff in areas where there are shortages <e> <s> that should help to reduce overtime <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not have figures to compare our manning levels with overseas operators <e> <s> i shall endeavour to ascertain whether comparable figures are available and perhaps write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> there is little that i can add to my reply to the debate just before christmas <e> <s> if british rail were to be privatised safety would continue to be paramount <e> <s> we would obviously have to ensure that is so through rigorous oversight by an independent inspectorate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that the noble lord lord underhill mentioned privatisation in his question <e>", "<cs> i apologise my lords <e> <s> the noble lord did mention british telecom <e> <s> however as i said in my previous answer there is absolutely no reason to suppose that privatisation would affect safety one way or the other <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already said that british rail is considering a range of measures to encourage recruitment and the retention of staff <e>", "<cs> my lords the responsibility of british rail is to run a safe economic and efficient railway <e> <s> it is obviously right that it should look at staff numbers in that context <e> <s> i remind the noble lord that although subsidy to the railway system has gone down which must be a good thing at the moment railway investment is at the highest level for years <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his reception of these important regulations <e> <s> i should point out that abour per cent <e> <s> of passenger ro-ro ferries from the united kingdom sail under a foreign flag <e> <s> it is therefore important that such regulations as have already applied to uk registered vessels since i think st february should be made to apply to foreign flag vessels <e>", "<cs> my lords my immediate answer to the noble lord is yes <e> <s> if they were passenger carrying ro-ro ferries operating international services out of a uk port they should be covered by these regulations <e> <s> with regard to the example to which the noble lord referred i can confidently say that yes they would apply <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords some of the telephone complaints received implied a threat of violence and one anonymous caller used words to the effect that there could be a bomb on the underground if nothing was done <e> <s> that threat was not judged to be serious <e> <s> however some posters were defaced and lrt considered that there was a risk of incidents endangering passenger safety <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that when london transport advertising accepted the advertisement in the first place it did not foresee the political significance of the reference to northern cyprus nor did it foresee the threats which might be received <e>", "<cs> my lords this is of course a contractual matter between london transport advertising and the advertiser <e> <s> early discussions are being arranged between the parties with the aim of finding a solution which meets the advertising needs of mosaic holidays and the terms and conditions of london transport advertising to which i referred in my original answer <e>", "<cs> no my lords there is no question of that <e> <s> the primary consideration was that the reference to northern cyprus was causing offence to a significant group of passengers <e> <s> i understand that london transport advertising often rejects campaigns on those grounds <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that i have to agree very much with what the noble lord lord mellish says <e> <s> there would almost certainly have been a great deal more of a row if something of that nature had happened than there is now as a result of what did happen <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> as i said the reason london transport withdrew the posters was that part of the contract stipulated <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of that fact <e> <s> however i shall take my noble friends word for it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that every case must be dealt with on its own merits <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that the bomb threat was not judged to be serious <e> <s> that is true <e> <s> however some of the posters were defaced and london regional transport considered that there was a risk of incidents endangering passenger safety <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we would give advice if threats were received <e> <s> if they needed to be taken seriously we should be bound to give advice on them <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to my noble friend we are not taking a different point of view <e> <s> london regional transport has clearly stated terms in its contract <e> <s> if those terms are breached it is entitled to withdraw the posters <e>", "<cs> my lords as i believe i said earlier london regional transport did not understand or foresee the political significance in the reference to northern cyprus <e>", "<cs> my lords i can agree with the latter part of the noble lords question it is not the governments policy to give in to threats of violence <e> <s> in my original answer i quoted the passage from london regional transports contract as to where an advertisement might offend ethnic religious or other major groups <e> <s> if it felt that the advertisement fell within those terms that is why it was turned down <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the reception that has been given to the statement today <e> <s> i should like to congratulate the noble baroness lady turner on attempting to defend what in the view of many noble lords on this side of the house must appear indefensible <e> <s> i quite agree that when the scheme came into effect in there was good reason to have it and there was casualism in those days <e> <s> but that was over years ago and the industry has changed considerably <e> <s> new technology has been introduced and there are many more expensive facilities operated by many fewer dockers at our ports <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his support for the measure that we have announced this afternoon which comes as no surprise <e> <s> in the last years the non-scheme ports share of business has risen from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> of trade <e> <s> however i would argue with my noble friend <e> <s> the port of london is now doing very much better and i hope it will continue to do better still as a result of the measures that we have announced this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i shall quickly respond to the points made by the noble lord lord mccarthy <e> <s> i covered the point about why we had no green paper and why we had no consultation when i answered the questions of the noble lord lord rochester <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the remarks of my noble friend whose great experience goes back of course to the famous aldington-jones agreement of <e> <s> i should emphasise that in referring to the transport and general workers union i was quoting the national secretary of the docks waterways and fishing group of the tgwu the person who speaks for the scheme as such <e> <s> whether those views are held by all other members of the tgwu i do not know i hope they are not <e>", "<cs> my lords once more i am grateful to my noble friend who i know has taken an interest in this matter for very many years <e> <s> he is right that the time has now come for it to be dealt with <e> <s> it is no good pretending that there are no problems with the scheme at the moment <e> <s> every week we find another problem be it fishing in aberdeen grimsby or on the clyde <e> <s> there is never a time when there is not one issue or another boiling up <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble viscount for his reception of our proposals <e> <s> i believe that when i repeated the statement i said that employers estimate costs in scheme ports some per cent <e> <s> higher than they need be <e> <s> i hope that when the scheme goes it will give the scheme ports the chance to get back on to a fair and competitive basis with the non-scheme ports <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord started with perhaps guarded support as i thought for the abolition of the scheme <e> <s> when he has the opportunity of reading the white paper that we have published he will see that there is every reason for the scheme to be abolished <e> <s> as i have already said the positions of those involved in the industry are clear and irreconcilable <e> <s> the unions have stated repeatedly their attachment to the fundamentals of the scheme <e> <s> they have regularly threatened national strikes in the event of any attempt to reduce the schemes damaging restrictions <e> <s> it is time and it is the governments duty to take the necessary action through parliament to abolish promptly the scheme and its statutes so that the disruption that any strikes may cause can be minimised <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> we are well aware of the problem in aberdeen <e> <s> we have seen such problems in different ports throughout the country from time to time <e> <s> it is notable that aberdeen lost per cent <e> <s> of its business between and while peterhead outside the scheme increased its business by per cent <e> <s> to twice the size of that of aberdeen <e> <s> i hope that the proposals we have announced today will enable aberdeen once more to flourish in its rightful place as a fishing port <e>", "<cs> my lords no one must take each case on its merits <e> <s> in my view the merits for action in this case are absolutely clear cut <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friends advice will be heeded <e> <s> he is right in saying that we wish to put our ports in a competitive position to deal with competition not only between non-scheme ports in this country but also with the near continental ports <e> <s> i hope that the measures that we have put forward today will allow our traditional scheme properly to compete once again <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept what the noble lord has said about the scheme as it existed years ago but times have changed <e> <s> we do not see a return to casualism <e> <s> there is little casualism in the non-scheme ports which carry out per cent <e> <s> of our business <e> <s> i gather that it is per cent <e> <s> which is roughly the same as in many other industries <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his remarks <e> <s> the measures which we introduced in the merchant shipping act last year received widespread support from all sides of the house <e> <s> so far fishing vessels have been refused registration owing to the fact that they could not comply with the ownership requirement <e>", "<cs> my lords we always expected that there would be legal difficulties <e> <s> the divisional court referred certain questions concerning the application of the treaty of rome to the european court <e> <s> however the government remain firmly of the view that the new registration rules are fully in compliance with the terms of the common fisheries policy <e> <s> the court of appeal has ruled that the provisions of the act should apply unless and until the ecj holds otherwise <e> <s> there is now an appeal on that point to the house of lords which i understand will be heard on th april <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to pay tribute to the staff of the registrar of shipping and seamen at cardiff who have had a great deal of work to do in compiling the new register <e> <s> thirteen thousand owners were informed that the register opened on st december and that the requirements were intended to be met by st march <e> <s> so far out of applicants have been issued with full certificates and have been issued with temporary certificates valid until th june to allow further inquiries about the vessels to be completed so that a full certificate can be issued <e> <s> there may have been some incorrect information on the forms <e> <s> that is not necessarily the fault of the registrar <e> <s> it may have been that the fishing vessels have not kept the information up to date over the years <e> <s> however as i have said we have made provision for that problem <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a question for my right honourable friend at the ministry of agriculture <e> <s> i understand that vessels will be stopped from fishing if they are not registered and not allowed to fish against our quotas <e> <s> i understand that maff has patrol boats and aircraft which will prevent that happening <e>", "<cs> my lords we remain firmly of the view that the new registration rules are firmly in accordance with the common fisheries policy <e> <s> the common fisheries policy allocates national quotas and i believe is generally regarded as operating fairly satisfactorily <e> <s> it is therefore totally wrong that vessels of other nations should be allowed to fish against our quota by registering in this country <e> <s> i understand that no other country allows that either <e> <s> therefore we are confident that at the end of the day what we have done will be seen to be right <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my original answer we shall of course take into account the select committees recommendations <e> <s> we shall respond to them in the normal way <e> <s> we have commissioned the caa to give us advice by july of this year <e> <s> we shall have to wait to see what it advises <e>", "<cs> my lords the advice that the caa has given us was in the consultation document that it produced cap <e> <s> it is plainly wrong to reach decisions until we have considered the caas formal advice in july which is not that far away now when everyone will have had their chance to say something <e>", "<cs> my lords like airport capacity airspace is equally a concern <e> <s> obviously one cannot reach a decision on one without knowing what the effects on the other will be <e> <s> that will be a very important part of the civil aviation authoritys advice when it gives it to us in july <e> <s> i think it would be wrong for me to comment in your lordships house on the select committees report in another place as of course it will be receiving the normal formal response to that report in the usual way <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join the noble lord in expressing regret that the noble baroness lady burton of coventry has had an accident <e> <s> i am sure i speak for everybody on our side of the house when i wish her a speedy recovery <e> <s> i congratulate the noble lord lord aylestone on having taken up the cudgels that she has left off <e> <s> so far as concerns night flying at gatwick and <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend

proposes to build a fifth terminal at heathrow it would have to be subject to planning permission <e> <s> however i should perhaps have said earlier that there are three factors in the equation airport capacity airspace capacity and terminal capacity <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my original reply the function is a consultative and advisory one <e> <s> this is a very useful body in that respect and it is perhaps notable that the united states department of transportation is now setting up a similar committee in the united states

it is useful for us to be able to discuss that matter with the representatives whom i mentioned in my original answer in order to seek their views and to receive suggestions from them but it must

are made under the health and safety at work etc <e> <s> act <e> <s> at the time it was obviously thought that such orders should proceed by negative resolution and that remains the case <e>", "<cs> my lords the regulations to which i have referred about which my noble friend asked me have nothing whatever to do with the carriage of atomic waste <e> <s> they refer to the carriage of explosives <e> <s> i thought that had been made perfectly clear <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously we shall need to see what advice we receive in july from the caa when it has completed the consultations that it sought in its cap document <e> <s> i have no doubt that if another runway were required in the south-east by the turn of the century it would indeed be possible to achieve <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his information <e> <s> i have no doubt that manston will be putting forward or will have put forward its views to the caa so that those can be taken into account when the time comes to give us advice <e>", "<cs> my lords prestwick is a long way from the south-east to which my noble friends question refers <e> <s> i have told my noble friend lord ferrier on a number of occasions that the baa has asked us to review the situation at prestwick <e> <s> we have not yet made a decision <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be nearer in time but the distance remains the same so far as i know <e> <s> one must recognise that per cent <e> <s> of the traffic using south-eastern airports emanates in the south-east of england <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously a debate would be a matter for the usual channels to decide <e> <s> air traffic control will have to be taken into account by the caa when it gives us advice <e> <s> it is one of the most important factors in the equation <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be helpful at this point if i intervene to give a brief indication of the governments view on the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the transport and road research laboratory found that improved driver reaction times resulted from the use of such lamps particularly where obligatory brake and rear position lights were combined <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i understand that although we are making regulations to reduce the intensity of the rear lamps manufacturers who fit them as standard are doing so already <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure of the system to which the noble viscount refers <e> <s> therefore i cannot say whether it would be good to have a special sign on cars fitted with the system <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend makes a good point i am sure we are all personally aware of such incidents <e> <s> time and time again the department emphasises the fact that people should not travel too closely behind the car in front and that is made clear in the <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that is the case as it is in canada <e> <s> i believe that when they were first fitted there was a considerable improvement but that there have since been complaints about dazzle <e>", "<cs> my lords it is that within which one could stop safely should anything happen to the car in front <e>", "<cs> my lords in great britain in the latest year for which detailed figures are available people died in accidents on two-lane motorways and people were injured <e> <s> the equivalent figures for motorways with three or more lanes were people killed and injured <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously the choice of whether to have a new motorway with two or three lanes depends on the expected volume of traffic on that particular stretch of road <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a question rather wide of the one on the order paper but i take note of what the noble lord said and i shall draw his remarks to the attention of my honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that most are <e> <s> we have recently announced that the missing section of the m is to be three-lane <e> <s> however in not all cases does the volume of traffic justify three lanes sometimes only two lanes are justified <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i have anything to add to what i said in the recent debate on the north report <e> <s> the fatality rate for motorways is about half the rate for other non-built-up roads while the overall casualty rate is about one-third of that on other non-built-up roads <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> i have given an answer to the question as it was put down on the order paper <e> <s> the answer to the noble lords question is that the total casualty rate for motorways is per million vehicle kilometres for two-lane motorways the rate is per million vehicle kilometres and for motorways with three or more lanes the figure is per million vehicle kilometres <e>", "<cs> my lords the relevant uk legislation is section of the vat act which reflects provisions of article a of the ec vat sixth directive <e> <s> the latter specifically requires that the taxable amount shall include taxes duties levies and charges excluding the value added tax itself <e> <s> that is not unique <e> <s> the same applies to wines and spirits tobacco petrol and goods imported from outside the community <e>", "<cs> my lords i fail to see why it should put the uk car industry at a disadvantage when it applies to any cars whether uk built or imported <e>", "<cs> my lords charities are a different question <e> <s> however it does not seem to me that it harms the motor car industry greatly when one sees a continual breaking of records in car <e>", "<cs> my lords that is rather wide of the question <e> <s> the noble lord never ceases to harp on about the fact that vat was per cent <e> <s> in and is now per cent <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord might compare the rates of income tax over the same period <e>", "<cs> my lords that is probably right because it is added value to the price of the goods <e>", "<cs> my lords not at all <e> <s> that is a quite different question but the figure that i have given for new car registrations surely proves the opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords rather than urge my right honourable friend to do that i shall certainly pass on my noble friends opinions on this subject without necessarily endorsing those opinions myself <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are aware of the concern which has been expressed by my noble friend <e> <s> we are considering the position <e> <s> ultimately it will be for parliament to decide the contents of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give details of the names of the streets concerned <e> <s> i understand that the area has a number of listed buildings which might be affected <e> <s> it will be for british rail to explain why there is no alternative <e>", "<cs> my lords we are aware of the concern about clause and we are considering the position <e> <s> parliament will wish closely to consider this point when the bill becomes before the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot say any more than i have just said <e> <s> we are aware of the concern about clause and we are considering the position <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that they are listed for a purpose <e> <s> we are considering this point at the moment and british rail will have to justify its proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the private bill procedure is the only procedure available for the authorisation of new railway works <e> <s> of course objectors have the opportunity to petition against the bill and to be heard by select committees in both houses <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the proposals involved in that area are for a subsurface link and not an overground link <e> <s> however the problem is that the development would involve demolition in order to put in the link and then reinstatement of some kind would be necessary <e> <s> that appears to be the issue at stake <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is referring to the proposed channel tunnel link it is not just a question of time saved it is a question of the overall capacity of the line <e>", "<cs> my lords the capacity of waterloo station is not unlimited <e> <s> indeed british rail estimates that its capacity would be about million passengers a year <e> <s> however british rail feels that there is a need for a second terminal to cope with traffic growth beyond that figure <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much agree with what my noble friend has said <e> <s> in fact that is what i have been trying to say in answer to many of the supplementary questions <e>", "<cs> my lords we are now going a long way beyond the scope of the original question <e> <s> the peckham proposal is concerned with the fast channel tunnel rail link and a bill in that connection has not yet been submitted <e>", "<cs> my lords i can indeed confirm that discussions take place between the department of the environment and the department of transport on such issues <e> <s> in fact when i was briefed on this question i was briefed by officials from both departments <e>", "<cs> my lords i have read with interest the discussion in committee on the similar amendment moved by the noble lord lord peston <e> <s> it appears to me that there was and is little between us <e> <s> as my noble friend the secretary of state explained since the matters in section are ones to which the mmc must have regard he must <e>", "<cs> my lords again i have read with interest the discussion in committee about section of the fair trading act <e> <s> at that time my noble friend lord strathclyde was trying to persuade the noble lord lord lloyd that any additional reference there to anti-competitive practice was unnecessary <e> <s> that obviously succeeded so well that he is now suggesting adopting the term in section as it stands <e> <s> it may therefore seem rather churlish of me if i say that that remains in our view unnecessary and indeed a possible recipe for confusion <e>", "<cs> my lords we are always open to useful suggestions <e> <s> i understand that the word suspects is quite commonly used in legislation therefore i see nothing unusual about using it in this case <e> <s> however if i find that there is any reason to change that opinion i shall certainly write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> this amendment relates to one of the exceptions which will make it possible for the secretary of state to refer a merger to the monopolies and mergers commission even after it has been prenotified and the period for consideration has expired without a reference <e> <s> there may seem to be rather a number of these exceptions but the intention behind them is simply to leave the authorities no worse off than they are at present <e> <s> it must be borne in mind that otherwise once the <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord williams of elvel explained this amendment is concerned with the statements and comments made to the director general of fair trading before he submits his advice on a merger to the secretary of state <e> <s> it raises a number of different issues and in dealing with them i propose like the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran to concentrate on the substance of the amendment and not on a widely publicised case which may or may not have prompted it <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall obviously be coming to amendment no <e> <s> l in a moment or two <e> <s> i considered the different paragraphs in the amendment of the noble lord lord williams and commented on each one of them in particular that one which as i said would come up again with amendment no <e> <s> l <e>", "<cs> my lords with permission not only shall i reply to amendment no <e> <s> ea but i shall speak also to government amendment no <e> <s> l because both these amendments arise from the same debate in committee on amendments moved by the noble lord lord peston <e> <s> those amendments were designed respectively to give the director general of fair trading and the monopolies and mergers commission a duty to seek representations on mergers from relevant employees employee organisations and consumer organisations <e>", "<cs> my lords there were a number of discussions during the committee stage about the public interest test set out in section of the fair trading act <e> <s> many of your lordships will therefore know that the section requires the monopolies and mergers commission in deciding whether something is against the public interest to take into account all matters that appear to it to be relevant <e> <s> it goes on to give a list of particular matters to which it must have regard <e> <s> the list is inclusive not exclusive <e> <s> this amendment seems designed to remove the inclusivity so that the mmc would be required only to have regard to the desirability of those matters specified <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that is what i am trying to explain <e> <s> it is something which must or could be taken into account and it was on this occasion <e> <s> but this amendment would make it more difficult for the mmc to base an adverse public interest finding on a factor not listed here and so less weight would be attached to such factors <e>", "<cs> my lords as noble lords have said we are back on familiar ground which was debated in committee as to the status of the takover panel and the takeover code <e> <s> the main purpose of the amendment moved then by the noble lord lord williams of elvel was that there was difficulty in running two systems one under the financial services act and one operated by the panel in parallel <e> <s> my noble friend the secretary of state for trade and industry and other noble lords with experience in these matters explained that in fact the arrangements for co-operation between the two systems worked excellently <e> <s> the amendment before us now is not designed to tackle that issue <e> <s> it provides for a takeover panel to be designated by the secretary of state not by the securities and investments board <e> <s> the panel would continue to operate outside the ambit of the financial services act <e> <s> however the essential issue that noble lords are asked to consider is the same as that discussed in committee <e> <s> it is whether there is a need to change the status of the panel from that of a voluntary body to one which operates under statute <e>", "<cs> my lords i was just about to come to subsection which is an attempt to constrain the ability of the courts to intervene on panel decisions <e> <s> the important point is that the subsection would not necessarily achieve its apparent objective of preventing tactical litigation during takeovers <e> <s> the court of appeal has set itself guidelines as to how it will consider applications for judicial review of panel decisions <e> <s> it has constrained itself from attempting to reverse decisions made by the panel <e> <s> it is not simply a matter of attempting as the amendment does to limit the role of the courts to that of judicial review <e> <s> the crucial question is the extent to which if the arrangements proposed by the noble lord were adopted the courts would in undertaking judicial review be disposed to reverse panel rulings <e> <s> i hope that that explanation clarifies the point about which the noble lord was concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the house that it is certainly not the first time that a measure of this kind has been put forward before a bill becomes an act <e> <s> it is quite common <e> <s> i cannot personally remember the last time that i experienced it but i have certainly known it to happen <e> <s> obviously it is just a matter of convenience to do this at this stage now rather than waiting for something else to happen <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly i cannot explain the last point made by the noble lord no <e> <s> however i imagine that if the sections of the water act change it will be possible to make amendments to this bill to take care of it <e>", "<cs> my lords there will be a water act by the time this bill is passed <e> <s> if the section number is changed by the insertion of other clauses the number in this bill will also be changed <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> i shall have to write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of the concern of the noble lord lord williams about this matter <e> <s> however i am sure that the noble lord would agree that it would be undesirable to have an anomaly of this kind in this instance which would mean that the change extended to all references made to the mmc with the sole exception of those under the telecommunications act <e> <s> the amendment merely removes that anomaly <e> <s> i hope therefore that although the noble lord may not agree with the principle he will recognise that it would be silly to leave an anomaly in this instance <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> this issue has been debated at some length <e> <s> that would be a matter of i am searching for the expression the tail wagging the dog <e> <s> i shall leave it there <e> <s> the noble lord knows what i mean <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mccarthy has raised an important topic for debate tonight but i am bound to ask why he should have felt it necessary to do so <e> <s> the government have decided that the dock labour scheme should be abolished and have accordingly introduced the dock work bill <e> <s> the reasons for that were made quite clear in the statement in the white paper and in my right honourable friends second reading speech in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> that is exactly the point which i am trying to make at the moment <e> <s> these are statutory provisions and therefore the mmc cannot make recommendations on them <e> <s> i shall not give way to the noble lord lord mccarthy <e> <s> he spoke for minutes which is quite enough on an unstarred question <e> <s> i did not interrupt the noble lord and i should be grateful if he will give me the opportunity of giving the governments response <e>", "<cs> my lords the pnpf trust company limited was established jointly by the port authorities and the pilots <e> <s> its constitution provides for equal representation of both among the trustee directors of the company and for a negotiating forum composed of representatives of the port authorities and pilots to decide questions of policy <e> <s> this seems to be a fair arrangement which was freely entered into by both ports and pilots <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said the arrangements are now for the port authorities and the pilots <e> <s> this is clearly a matter to be resolved in the negotiating forum of port authorities and pilots which was set up under the terms of the constitution of the pnpf trust company limited and by the trustee directors <e> <s> i have no doubt that the pilots will be able to put their case in that forum which is the correct place in which to put it <e>", "<cs> my lords we propose this summer to introduce a trial in parallel with our present manual checks which will comprise new automatic weighing equipment at five ferry ports <e> <s> the equipment will check the majority of heavy goods vehicles coming in at those ports <e> <s> subject to the outcome of the trial we shall consider similar installations in other ports <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a slightly different point <e> <s> the regulations introduced recently as the noble lord is aware were for ferry safety purposes <e> <s> therefore we weigh vehicles only on outbound ferries <e> <s> that is to ensure the safety of merchant shipping <e>", "<cs> my lords the uk drive axle weight limit for five- or six-axle vehicles is tonnes <e> <s> the gross weight limit for these vehicles is tonnes <e> <s> both limits are significantly lower than the weight limits in the ec which has a -tonne limit for international traffic <e> <s> our derogation from the limit is temporary <e> <s> we have said that we cannot accept any increase in the total axle weight until our roads and bridges have been surveyed and strengthened where necessary <e> <s> that will inevitably take some years to complete <e> <s> no early increase in lorry weights is contemplated <e> <s> in any case any increase would be brought into effect only with the approval of parliament <e>", "<cs> no my lords not by <e> <s> i am not certain i do not think that the derogation has a definite time limit <e> <s> however as i said we shall have to be satisfied that our roads and bridges are capable of carrying the increased weights <e> <s> that might take some years beyond to achieve <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> i think i can be quite clear that our derogation does not necessarily become invalid in <e> <s> i think that it is not necessarily part of the process <e> <s> if i may put it like that <e>", "<cs> my lords the inspectorate has enforcement weighbridge sites <e> <s> i believe we plan to increase that figure to over the next two or three years <e> <s> however the figure applies to the whole country and not necessarily just to the ports <e> <s> obviously we shall need sufficient numbers of people to enforce that new measure <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a rather different question to the one on the order paper which relates to the number of vehicles which are found to be overweight <e>", "<cs> my lords that point is somewhat wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> nevertheless it is a very important point <e> <s> the question on the order paper refers to the number of vehicles which have been found to be overweight <e> <s> i have given an answer as regards the tonne limit <e> <s> my understanding is that that limit can only be brought into effect with the approval of both houses of parliament in this country <e> <s> as regards any further detail on that matter i shall have to write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> further progress with the scheme is dependent on the outcome of the review of the river thames bridge design being undertaken by consultants <e> <s> the consultants are finalising their report and expect to submit it soon <e> <s> an announcement will be made when the report has been considered <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport has already undertaken in another place to place a copy of the report in the library of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has referred to oxleas wood <e> <s> that is not part of the new inquiry which is being undertaken into the bridge itself and which is the subject of the noble lords question <e> <s> there is no proposal to go back on any other part of the route concerned with the east london river crossing <e>", "<cs> my lords that is perfectly true <e> <s> that is why we took the decision to have another look at the design of the bridge and we are awaiting the results at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot answer the latter point which the noble lord has raised about a segregated cycle path <e> <s> i am not aware that we said that the review would take six months <e> <s> so far as i know we have always said that the results of the inquiry would be available round about now and we can expect the results fairly shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly take a look <e> <s> if it has taken longer than we thought it would then i can only apologise to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i cannot give an undertaking that parliament will consider the matter although of course the noble lord has the opportunity to raise these points at question time <e> <s> the secretaries of state jointly carefully considered the issues before deciding last july that <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no statutory requirement to hold a ballot before organising industrial action but if a union wishes to protect itself from legal proceedings for inducing interference with contracts it must hold a proper ballot before doing so <e> <s> it would not be practical to require the organisers of unofficial action to hold a ballot before taking such action <e> <s> they do not have the same relationship with those being induced to strike as a trade union which induces its members

week <e> <s> i have no evidence that the union aided and abetted that unofficial action <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can comment on that accusation <e> <s> from the point of view of the law it was not an official strike and therefore the union was not involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that that is correct <e> <s> i understand that the ballot which has taken place concerns a different issue from the one-man operated trains issue which was the cause of the unofficial action referred to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure what the requirements are for a ballot <e> <s> however they are defined in law and if the ballot does not <e>", "<cs> my lords that question goes rather wide of the one on the order paper <e> <s> indeed it is a very general question which would more properly be the subject of a debate rather than a question to be answered at question time <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot comment on that question <e> <s> i understand that the unions opposed the unofficial actions <e> <s> how strongly they did so and whether or not they were effective is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords considerable inconvenience was caused to the travelling public in london as a result of the two unofficial one-day strikes <e> <s> it may well be that there was intimidation and i am extremely disturbed by reports that threats of intimidation were used <e> <s> if

shall wait to see the result of that meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not something new <e> <s> one-man trains were introduced in <e> <s> what is in dispute is whether the drivers of those trains should receive an additional payment for operating without guards <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously i cannot answer for what the unions might or might not have done if they had heard the remarks made in the house this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords as my right honourable friend the prime minister made clear in another place on th april the decisions resulting from the recent scrutiny report of government economic statistics <e>", "<cs> my lords the integrity of the cso is in no way altered by the changes in ministerial responsibilities <e> <s> their sole purpose is to assist in improving the quality of statistics for macroeconomic management following the recommendations of the cabinet office scrutiny report <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to all the questions is the same namely that obviously the whole purpose of the exercise is to improve the quality of statistics that are produced <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of these changes is indeed to cut abuse of the system <e> <s> these changes have been welcomed by disabled groups <e> <s> to make it possible to remove the badge when not being used would have certain disadvantages <e> <s> however the new badge will emphasise

badges issued has been rising dramatically over the past few years <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that at present the orange badges have a validity of three years <e> <s> our proposal would extend that period to five years <e> <s> they need to be renewed occasionally otherwise for instance if the person who has one dies someone else could continue using it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to

authorities i am not certain that i can answer that question on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case the noble lord must be pleased that they have now gone <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already answered that question by saying that outside the roads programme in the nationalised industries and the public sector the government would be happy to approve proposals for private financing of public sector projects provided of course that they offer better value for money than the publicly funded alternative <e>", "<cs> no my lords the first and foremost principle is that private finance for a project is justified if and only if it provides the best value for money <e> <s> secondly the government need to take into account the existence of privately financed projects in their

unlikely if they were forced to take a vocational driving test either to be able to afford to do so or to spend the time necessary to do so <e> <s> it is completely unnecessary because there is absolutely no evidence that there is any more danger from those people driving minibuses than if they were driving cars <e>", "<cs> my lords fortunately we have not yet reached that stage <e> <s> as i said earlier negotiations are expected to take at least another months <e> <s> we shall obviously bear carefully in mind what my noble friend has said <e>", "<cs> my lords that question is a little wide of the scope of the question on the order paper <e> <s> if i were to answer about the ems as i have done on many occasions my answer would be the same as the one that i have previously given <e>", "<cs> my lords that may well be the case but the proposed directive goes a great deal further than deaf drivers <e> <s> it would prohibit anyone not holding a vocational driving licence from driving a minibus with more than eight seats <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall certainly endeavour to use that argument <e> <s> but as we have said we have absolutely no evidence to suppose that deafness leads to any diminution in driving skills <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the reception given to this apparently complicated but straightforward order <e> <s> to answer the points raised by the noble lord lord underhill yes a frenchman coming to this country would be allowed to drive say an hgv which he brought into this country as he is able to do now and he will also be allowed to drive a vehicle which is already here so to speak <e> <s> that would not apply to a non-ec national who would only be allowed to do what he is at present doing that is to drive a temporarily imported vehicle <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i misinformed the noble lord <e> <s> as i said in my original answer i had no knowledge of the radioactive waste that was in the area <e> <s> nor i would submit was it necessary for me to have such knowledge <e> <s> as i have said the presence of those materials did not affect in any way the thorough search which the french made of this area <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not advise the noble lord to drink salt water <e> <s> however the waters are certainly not contaminated <e> <s> there is no sign of contamination from the missing container <e>", "<cs> my lords i can say that the waste is low grade and the danger to humans is considered to be negligible <e>", "<cs> my lords as i made clear at the time when i was answering the noble lords question this search area is the responsibility of the french and not of the british government <e> <s> the french were told by the ministry of defence of the presence this material <e> <s> there was no need for my department to be aware of that information <e>", "<cs> my lords i can certainly confirm i am sure that all noble lords would agree that the noble earl is looking most healthy despite the radioactivity <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have tried to say there is a very little risk indeed from this low grade material which was dumped in this site years ago <e> <s> the location was chosen because of the depth of water and the narrowness of the deep which would contain the munitions and nuclear waste and prevent their movement on the sea bed <e> <s> i think that i can give a reasonable assurance that there is no danger in this regard <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the answer would be the almighty <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> i understand that this waste consists mainly of test tubes from hospitals gloves overalls and so on <e> <s> they are packed in metal drums and then filled with concrete <e> <s> there is therefore very little danger of any escape <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord hatch has obviously read my honourable friends reply in another place he will see that the munitions have not been dumped since the war <e> <s> they were dumped between and about <e> <s> the answer is that nobody is intending to clean it up <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord underhill for providing the house with the opportunity for a debate which will touch on many aspects of this important subject <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate has certainly lived up to its potential in covering such a wide range of transport topics and doing so in such commendable depth <e> <s> these are important topics since they affect the fabric of our everyday lives and the performance of the economy on which we all so obviously depend <e> <s> so i should like to try to respond to as many points as my time allows but i am quite conscious that with the large number of matters raised i shall not be able to answer every point that every noble lord has made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that it was i who said it but i shall come to that point later <e> <s> i know that a number of questions have been asked about the scheme and we said at the time that we had no plans then to deal with it <e> <s> i can assure noble lords that i never attempted to justify the scheme <e> <s> perhaps i may continue <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall come on to many of those points if i may be allowed to <e> <s> the noble lord is down to speak in due course <e> <s> he can make his points at that stage <e> <s> i shall be delighted to answer those points at the end of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords anyone who has followed the passage of this bill over the past nine weeks and heard todays debate cannot doubt that the issues relevant to the future of the dock labour scheme have been thoroughly examined <e> <s> but it seems to me that the two central questions are whether special controls are necessary any longer to provide a basis for reasonable terms and conditions of employment for dock workers and whether those controls themselves give rise to unacceptable costs which prevent our ports from performing as they should <e> <s> we must not forget that at the end of the day pay and jobs depend on the ability of business to compete successfully and to create wealth <e>", "<cs> my lords we are certainly not saying that there is a major economic crisis at the moment <e> <s> i was asked to give an example of a bill which was introduced in such haste and i have just done so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that there are all sorts of different things but i was referring to the docks business and the so-called jobs for life <e> <s> i have just given a reason why the phrase seems to have come up <e> <s> it is not a phrase which has necessarily been used all that often by the government <e> <s> it has been used by everybody so far as i can see <e> <s> it is often quoted in the national press <e> <s> incidentally the noble lord lord mccarthy said that dock workers earnings were only per cent <e> <s> above the national average <e> <s> my figure is that their earnings are per cent <e> <s> above average earnings at per week <e> <s> average earnings are per week for manual workers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am coming to the matter of the profitability of the scheme ports and i shall be able to answer the noble lord lord mellish in a few moments <e> <s> i shall move straight to that matter now <e> <s> i agree that most but not all scheme ports are making profits now <e> <s> however that is only after huge amounts of public funds have been put into some of them particularly london which is the former port of the noble lord and liverpool <e> <s> as my noble friend lord crickhowell pointed out much of the profit comes from land sales and property development <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware that the union had denied it on oath <e> <s> perhaps the best that i could do is to quote one of the most recent remarks of mr connolly <e> <s> on th february he said <e>", "<cs> my lords roads within the airport boundary are of course the responsibility of the airport itself and not the department of transport <e> <s> however the airport operates a computerised urban traffic control system to aid the smooth flow of traffic through the tunnel and within the central terminal area <e> <s> that system is monitored by a centrally controlled television camera <e> <s> a dedicated staff is responsible for the roads at heathrow <e> <s> further a heavy recovery vehicle is continuously available to speed the recovery of vehicles in an emergency or in a breakdown such as my noble friend described <e> <s> i shall of course draw my noble friends complaints to the attention of the appropriate authority and hope that something can be done to alleviate the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that that was not an isolated incident <e> <s> that may well be the case but it is the first time in two years that my attention has been drawn to troubles of that kind <e> <s> i cannot believe that there has been a great problem <e> <s> however i shall look into the situation which has been described <e>", "<cs> my lords that is why in my original answer i described some of the improvements which we propose to the public road network outside the airport <e>", "<cs> my lords the staff at heathrow airport maintain close liaison with the department of transport the police and the local authorities involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of any plans to build a further tunnel <e> <s> the authority does have plans to build a railway link from paddington to heathrow which i hope will go forward if the authority can produce a route which will satisfy your lordships select committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i note my noble friends suggestion and i shall pass it on to the appropriate people <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord mccarthy explained these amendments would allow employers of registered dock workers to escape the control of the scheme only when they had collective agreements and practices which guaranteed terms and conditions of employment training and welfare arrangements and arrangements for engagement termination of employment and discipline no less favourable than under the scheme <e> <s> the central arbitration committee on a reference from either the employers or employees representatives would have the last word on any disputed matters <e>", "<cs> we have had an interesting if sometimes slightly historical debate on this amendment <e> <s> however as the committee will know the government believe that the dock labour scheme damages the business prospects of the ports to which it applies <e> <s> it damages our national economic interests which rely so heavily on the performance of our ports <e> <s> the government are supported in that view not only by employers in scheme ports but by the confederation of british industry the association of british chambers of commerce and associations representing shipbrokers warehouse operators and road haulage <e> <s> all these organisations have an interest in successful ports able to create the wealth needed in an increasingly competitive industry to provide reasonable pay and conditions for its workers <e>", "<cs> one can hardly use that argument to explain why in the fishing industry for example aberdeen has lost trade to peterhead <e> <s> tilbury is a container port but it has lost trade to felixstowe <e> <s> those ports are not very far away from each other and both are on the east coast <e> <s> the fact is that the constraints of the scheme have definitely shifted trade away from scheme ports to the non-scheme ports <e> <s> higher productivity in the scheme ports has been paid for with fewer jobs not more business leading to more jobs <e> <s> that is why dockers jobs in the scheme ports have been lost at a rate of per cent <e> <s> a year over the past years <e> <s> that rate is almost the same as the improvement in productivity <e>", "<cs> i am not certain that he said that he had no intention of abolishing the scheme <e> <s> i expect that he said that he had no plans to do so at that time <e> <s> i also doubt that he said that he found no fault with the scheme <e> <s> i believe that the question may well have been asked by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e>", "<cs> i shall come to some of the other points in the amendment shortly <e> <s> as i said the scheme would function virtually as now <e> <s> the board and local boards would remain in being <e> <s> through them the unions would retain for example their powers to block decisions about the size of firms labour forces and recruitment to and discharge from scheme ports <e> <s> local boards would retain their powers over disciplinary matters <e> <s> in short employers of registered dock workers would be no closer in practice to the goal of working within the same framework of employment law as other employers <e>", "<cs> i do not have the facts with me to confirm or deny the statement of the noble lord <e> <s> i am sure that if he says that that is the case it is true <e>", "<cs> with the greatest respect i am not sure that my brief could be expected to encompass what the merseyside chamber of commerce one of hundreds of chambers of commerce might have said about the bill <e>", "<cs> the intention of amendment no <e> <s> is to delay the abolition of the scheme indefinitely if necessary pending its replacement with a new scheme which need be no less restrictive than the present one and might well be more extensive <e>", "<cs> this amendment as i understand it would require employers formerly registered under the scheme to take over from the date of royal assent responsibility for agreements entered into by the board before that date <e> <s> it would also substitute the employers for the board thereafter <e> <s> the amendment would make the employers liable for funding the boards running costs and wind-up costs during the transitional period as well as any residual liabilities on dissolution <e> <s> the financial memorandum estimates that those liabilities after the sale of assets might amount to million <e>", "<cs> i fear that the noble lord will once more be disappointed <e> <s> the purpose of the bill under consideration is to bring employment arrangements in scheme ports within the general legal framework which has evolved under successive governments since the schemes inception <e> <s> those developments include a health and safety at work act in which placed specific obligations on employers to make adequate provision for health safety and welfare <e> <s> the act also provides for proper participation by trade unions at national and local level in ensuring adequate arrangements <e> <s> there are now also a range of training structures which industries may choose to participate in according to their own assessment of needs <e>", "<cs> as the noble baroness has explained the amendment would require the united kingdom to ratify convention of the international labour office ilo on royal assent of the bill <e> <s> the convention was adopted by the general conference of the ilo in and came into effect in <e> <s> it sets out a number of requirements for those countries which ratify it concerning the employment of dock workers <e>", "<cs> as i said the majority of community countries have not ratified the convention that is to say germany denmark the belgium luxembourg ireland greece and ourselves <e> <s> france italy spain and the netherlands have and i think that is all <e> <s> rotterdam is a successful port <e> <s> it has some form of registration <e> <s> we do not have registration in our most successful ports and so it is not possible for us to ratify <e>", "<cs> before i reply to this amendment may i ask the noble baroness whether she was also talking to amendment no <e> <s> as well <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> to clause requires the secretary of state to report to parliament on how employment arrangements in the docks are to be determined following the dissolution of the board <e> <s> the list of items includes a number of inheritances from the existing dock labour scheme including registers of dock workers which the bill abolishes <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> which concerns the secretary of states powers to direct the board under clause would render those powers subject to the boards duties under section of the act <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is right <e> <s> the register will no longer exist and employment in that industry will be just as it is in any other industry and indeed as it is in the non-scheme ports where there are unregistered dock workers who now deal with per cent <e> <s> of this nations trade and if i may say so do so very successfully <e>", "<cs> i believe that these amendments would place severe constraints on the boards ability to dispose of its assets in the case of amendment no <e> <s> by restricting its scope to dispose of assets at less than market value with the agreement of the secretary of state and in the case of amendment no <e> <s> by dictating the terms under which the board can dispose of those assets <e> <s> by requiring the board and the secretary of state to submit detailed reports and estimates amendment no <e> <s> places an extra burden on the board during the transitional period a burden which will interfere with its duty to wind itself up <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> would require the secretary of state to report to parliament about assets and liabilities transferred to him on the dissolution of the board even though he was accountable to parliament for the exercise of his powers in this respect <e>", "<cs> the duties and limitations of the board in the transitional period have been carefully delineated under clauses and of the bill <e> <s> clause provides for measures to be taken by the secretary of state if the board is unable or unwilling to fulfil those duties <e> <s> that might occur because of conflicting interests on the board or deliberate attempts to block decisions causing a stalemate <e> <s> the board could not fulfil its duties in those conditions and would be replaced by a single appointee with the same powers <e>", "<cs> i have been enjoying the interventions of the noble lord lord mellish <e> <s> however i have not been able to agree with many of them <e>", "<cs> it may be helpful if i clarify one important point <e> <s> the dock labour scheme itself does not as this amendment suggests provide any entitlement to compensation for rdws made redundant <e> <s> the severance arrangements that have existed until now have been established on a voluntary non-statutory basis and are the result of a voluntary agreement the national voluntary severance scheme and subsequently the national employers release arrangement between the employers and the unions <e> <s> the only statutory element has been the governments ability to make loans and since grants for the severance payments <e> <s> the amounts of individual payments have not been expressed in statute <e> <s> this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords on commercial development the recent report of the kent impact monitoring study shows encouraging progress with for example schemes to accommodate producer services and high-tech industry a business park a distribution centre and hotel developments <e> <s> the kent impact monitoring study made a comparison of the competitors of kent and the <e>", "<cs> my lords direct rail services to points north of london should start when the tunnel opens <e> <s> there is sufficient capacity on the existing lines to accommodate them <e> <s> the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall have to see british rails proposals which under section of the act are indeed due by the end of this year <e> <s> there are already plans for developments in a number of places in the country in advance of those plans <e>", "<cs> my lords it is up to british rail and those interested the local authorities and commercial interests to come forward with plans <e> <s> we shall have to see what they propose <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been a substantial programme of events to highlight the benefits of the channel tunnel <e> <s> most recently there was such an event in scotland which was most successful <e> <s> it may interest my noble friend to know that in kent for example the proportion of firms who expect the tunnel to benefit their trade has increased from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> as the project has progressed and confidence has grown <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness is talking of the new proposed high speed line to the channel tunnel that is a matter which will have to be resolved by parliament when british rail comes forward with its bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i refer my noble friend to the most recently published white paper <e> <s> it will give details of all the road schemes in the area <e>", "<cs> my lords the m will be the main route to the entrance to the tunnel <e> <s> it will continue as a dual carriageway into dover and it is very much hoped that it will be complete by the time the tunnel opens <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot confirm that the depot is to be at crewe <e> <s> i suspect that we shall have to wait until british rail comes forward with its section plans <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> with regard to the noble lords first point about unemployment the figure is now well below million <e> <s> unemployment has fallen continuously for months in a row by over million <e> <s> the fall in unemployment is the longest and largest since the war <e> <s> combating inflation must remain the governments top priority and that is why interest rates stand where they are <e>", "<cs> my lords of course one regrets the extra burden that is placed on home buyers through interest rates <e> <s> however higher inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his encouraging remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords all regions in the country have benefited from the fall in unemployment <e> <s> long-term unemployment has fallen faster than unemployment as a whole and fallen in all the regions <e> <s> so far as concerns the governments policies their position is plain interest rates will be kept as high as is necessary for as long as is necessary to reduce inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords the main reason for the deficit is the surge in investment in the united kingdom which has not been matched by an increase in saving <e> <s> capital has therefore been invested from abroad with the current account deficit as the inevitable counterpart <e> <s> it may encourage noble lords to know that only one quarter of the growth in the value of manufactured imports between and was accounted for by consumer goods with the remainder fully <e>", "<cs> my lords manufacturing investment in this country grew by per cent <e> <s> last year to reach its highest ever level <e> <s> our manufacturing output in the first quarter of this year was at its highest ever level <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will be encouraged by those figures <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that the results of the election in and the subsequent record-breaking levels achieved by the economy speak for themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept that we are living well above our means as the noble lord has put it <e> <s> we are in a situation with a budget surplus of record-breaking proportions <e> <s> interest rates will have to remain as high as is necessary to bear down on inflation <e> <s> inflation is more damaging to industry than high interest rates <e>", "<cs> my lords the current underlying inflation rate excluding mortgage interest payments is considerably below the overall rpi <e> <s> it is currently per cent <e> <s> it is still too high <e> <s> that is why our main priority is to reduce it <e> <s> it is lower at the moment than in any month under the previous labour government and compares with their average rate of over per cent <e> <s> and a peak of per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend makes a very good point <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that that question is unlikely to arise <e>", "<cs> my lords the economic and financial council of th june had a constructive discussion of fraud against the community budget <e> <s> in particular the council endorsed the commissions point work programme for fighting fraud and called for early action on the commissions proposals to tighten controls in export refunds and intervention storage <e> <s> the uk played a major role in achieving the progress that has been made <e>", "<cs> my lords i deny that the government are taking a casual attitude to this matter <e> <s> we have achieved a great deal of what we wanted to see at the ecofin meeting which followed from the march ecofin in which the united kingdom played a leading role <e> <s> we tabled a wide range of proposals for combating fraud which was well received <e> <s> the council made a unanimous declaration which incorporated our major ideas <e> <s> the june ecofin consolidated the progress in ways reflecting the united kingdom ideas <e> <s> in particular the commission announced a detailed work programme for fighting fraud and proposals were announced on tightening controls in export refunds and intervention storage exactly as the united kingdom had asked <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said the government certainly do not have a casual attitude to that matter <e> <s> the whole government from the prime minister downwards including my right honourable friend the minister for agriculture take this matter extremely seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords that of course is a matter for the commission <e> <s> i believe that there have been prosecutions but i shall have to look into the matter and write to the noble and learned lord with the details <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have a detailed list of the recommendations which your lordships committee made at that time <e> <s> the proposals which the uk suggested and which were accepted comprised a timetable of proposals in the field of export refunds and intervention storage <e> <s> the commission tabled that at ecofin on th june and there were a series of other united kingdom-inspired measures which were accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not certain that that matter actually falls within the remit of this investigation <e>", "<cs> so far as what we are doing at home is concerned the commission wants per cent <e> <s> of consignments eligible for export refunds to be checked <e> <s> our customs already checks per cent <e> <s> which is in excess of the requirement <e> <s> we already concentrate checks on high risk consignments and products <e> <s> additional training has been given to officers by the customs and excise and cap liaison officers have been appointed to improve the flow of information concerning cap fraud <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot answer my noble and learned friends question <e> <s> i shall write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords the scheme was approved as an experiment for months <e> <s> the borough will need to seek further approval under the designated road procedures if it wishes to make the scheme permanent <e>", "<cs> my lords the borough consulted the police the traffic control systems unit fire and ambulance authorities bus managers adjoining local authorities and local amenity groups <e> <s> i believe that its consultation could therefore be said to have been reasonably extensive <e>", "<cs> my lords it is for the borough to reconcile the needs of pedestrians in what is a busy shopping street with those of motor traffic <e> <s> i understand that such works were accompanied by an adjustment of the traffic lights at either end <e> <s> that was intended to alleviate the situation <e> <s> it is an experimental scheme for months <e> <s> one will be better able to judge the situation at the end of that time <e>", "<cs> my lords as i explained in my original answer the secretary of state had a role to play <e> <s> although it was not a designated road it could have affected other designated roads in the area <e> <s> therefore my right honourable friends permission was sought <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree with my noble friend <e> <s> it is primarily a matter for the royal borough of kensington and chelsea <e> <s> it is one of its roads <e> <s> i would not hesitate to agree with my noble friend on the first part of his supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords although this is a borough council road my right honourable friends permission was sought because of the effect the plan might have had on the designated roads in the area although it is not in itself a designated road <e> <s> that is why the department was asked for its approval <e> <s> that is why our people looked into the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords in this case the job of the secretary of state is to look at the schemes effect on any designated roads in the area <e> <s> the issues of pedestrian safety which is a very important one and indeed of the road itself are for the borough council <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly we take seriously the matter of illegal parking on pavements <e> <s> we have announced that the matter is being looked into <e> <s> as regards street works last month we announced proposals for legislation which will include better signing and guarding of works and new national standards for quality of reinstatement <e> <s> we intend to introduce a bill at the earliest opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords that pavement is the responsibility of the local authority and it is for the local authority to keep its pavements in good order <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not seen the document to which the noble lord referred that has been so recently published <e> <s> i have no doubt that he will let me have a copy as i see that he has the document in his hand <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate my noble friend on her research <e> <s> i have to say of course that the pavements in this part of the world are the responsibility of westminster city council <e> <s> last years national road maintenance condition survey showed a slight reduction in the number of footway defects over the previous year but we certainly accept that there is still scope for improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate my noble friend on his ingenuity in bringing in to this question the subject of dog licences <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a very interesting debate on the amendment <e> <s> as the noble lord lord rochester explained the amendment concerns the function of the transitional period in respect of training and welfare provision for scheme ports <e> <s> it requires the secretary of state to satisfy himself that alternative arrangements have been made for training and welfare of dock workers before dissolving the national dock labour board <e>", "<cs> my lords i was coming to the port medical centres <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall deal with the point now as it relates to this part of the amendment <e> <s> as i said the industry is under the obligations of the first aid regulations <e> <s> under clause of the bill the board will have the power to dispose of its medical centres in such a way as to encourage continued provision to meet the needs of the industry and its workers <e> <s> to achieve this it will have the flexibility to transfer those assets at less than the market price with the permission of the secretary of state and the treasury <e> <s> the industry will have the opportunity to buy back provisions for which it has already paid through levies at a reasonable price <e> <s> it will therefore have every incentive to support centres where they are needed <e>", "<cs> my lords by establishing a minimum duration of months this amendment places the length of the transitional period above the need to wind up the boards activities in the rapid but orderly manner provided for by the bill <e> <s> it suggests that noble lords who have tabled this amendment are more interested in delaying matters than having an objective timetable based on the boards own assessment of the time it will need to wind up its activities and dispose of its assets sensibly where necessary in such a way as to meet the industrys continuing needs <e> <s> that is what the bill provides for <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall repeat what i said in my speech which is down on the record for the noble lord to read tomorrow <e> <s> the particular sentence for which he was looking was that the government have no arbitrary target for the transitional period and will respond to the boards indications of what needs to be done <e> <s> i hope that that is helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> proposes that before its dissolution the <e>", "<cs> my lords i never said that the registered ports are losing money <e> <s> some have lost a great deal of money over the years but i am glad to say that at present most are reasonably profitable although there is room for improvement <e> <s> what i said before and shall say again to the noble lord lord mellish is that if one compares costs between the scheme ports and the non-scheme ports one finds that scheme ports are more expensive in handling <e>", "<cs> my lords on the last occasion i gave the noble lord a figure for the comparative costs of handling a container at southampton and felixstowe <e>", "<cs> my lords i am giving way and repeating what i have already said in committee which can be read <e>", "<cs> my lords in connection with the new clause i fear that i must repeat that health and safety and welfare provision for dock workers both now and after the abolition of the dock labour scheme is covered by the health and safety at work act and its associated docks regulations which apply to all dock work in and outside dock labour scheme ports <e> <s> all these statutory requirements place the obligation for meeting the necessary standards on individual employers not the board and its provisions through the dock labour scheme <e> <s> the docks regulations also impose training requirements for staff in charge of machines such as cranes and transporters as well as standards for testing and the use of equipment in the workplace <e>", "<cs> my lords in debate here and in another place the government have taken great pains to explain the purpose of clause which allows the national dock labour board with the consent of the treasury and secretary of state to dispose of its assets at less than market value or for nothing <e>", "<cs> my lords i intend to restrict my remarks to the substance of the amendment which would require the national dock labour board itself composed of employer and employee representatives to initiate discussions during the transitional period between those same representatives about measures to maintain employment stability in ports covered by the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has explained these amendments are designed to achieve something very simple namely to ensure that compensation payments are available under our proposed scheme to former registered dock workers who volunteer for redundancy <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give the noble lord an assurance that care for the environment is included in the objectives of the assessment study so that the special nature of parkland walk will be fully considered <e> <s> if there was and i am not saying that there will be a plan to build a road in parkland walk that would have to go through the normal procedures <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend hopes to make an announcement on the revised design of the east london river crossing very soon <e> <s> the timing of completion will depend on the decision for the design of the bridge <e> <s> however it should be open in the mid-s <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i have not had the opportunity to walk the parkland walk myself <e> <s> clearly i shall have to speak to the noble lord outside the chamber about its merits <e> <s> i have already said that environmental considerations will be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the assessment will have to take account of what effects there will be on traffic outside the area <e> <s> i remind the house that these are only assessment studies by consultants <e> <s> they are not government proposals <e> <s> something needs to be done about the transport problems in that area and this is the best way of looking for the solution <e>", "<cs> my lords we have a number of plans for improving the transport infrastructure in the docklands including road improvements the expansion of the docklands light railway and the possibility of a new underground line to that area <e> <s> as to cotton street i do not have details with me <e>", "<cs> no my lords it is a result of increased prosperity created by this government in an otherwise rundown area <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not admitted as being chaos but i think we would rather have prosperity than none <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i have said as much about parkland walk as i can <e>", "<cs> my lords we understand that charges at prestwick vary depending on aircraft weight the number of passengers and aircraft parking time <e> <s> airlines serving prestwick as an intermediate stop will incure additional fuel costs and in some circumstances additional crew costs <e> <s> these will depend on the circumstances of each case <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my right honourable friend would have wished to add the words in the same area <e> <s> prestwick is part of the scottish lowlands airport area just as gatwick heathrow and stansted are part of the london area <e>", "<cs> my lords i can certainly confirm that prestwick airport is a fine airport and that it is within easy reach of glasgow <e> <s> it will be even better placed when various road and rail improvements announced by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland are made <e> <s> i am well aware of the views of people in the glasgow area about the additional transatlantic flights <e> <s> those views were made clear to me when the subject of this review arose <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the traffic distribution rules in the london area have had to be <e>", "<cs> my lords i am interested that the noble lord should call for such a review <e> <s> his honourable friends in another place from both the glasgow and prestwick areas made it clear to me that they did not wish any review to take place <e> <s> they were not the only ones who made that clear <e>", "<cs> my lords it did not seem to me that the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe had encountered difficulties <e> <s> however as i told the noble lord the scottish office is discussing with british rail and strathclyde pte the best way to improve rail access to prestwick including the possibility of a station at the airport <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the airline could always start the flight at prestwick airport rather than at glasgow airport <e>", "<cs> my lords the charges in respect of the use of prestwick airport are laid down in the conditions of use which apply to the airport <e> <s> they are therefore public to anyone who wishes to find them <e> <s> my original answer was to say that the charges and costs depended on many different factors including aircraft weight and so on <e> <s> thus they would vary <e> <s> however anyone can calculate the costs for themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i am of course aware of the problem <e> <s> the proposals which were put to us would have involved motorists every year entering their cars mileages on their road tax application forms and also when cars changed hands <e> <s> that would involve in the region of million transactions at the dvlc and cost around million to set up and million a year to run <e> <s> we did not consider the proposals to be justified <e> <s> on the other hand as i said in my original answer we are exploring other ways of dealing with the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords it is an offence under the trade description act and successful prosecutions are being made by trading standards departments <e> <s> in the year ended th september last there were successful prosecutions involving mis-described used cars mostly in relation to clocking <e> <s> the sum of was imposed in fines and a number of prison sentences were given <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have expected the noble lord to have been even more surprised if my reply this afternoon had not coincided with the letter that my honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the mileage is recorded on the mot certificate but that applies only to cars more than three years old <e> <s> a significant part of this problem concerns cars below that age <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the case <e> <s> if a person is thinking of buying a secondhand car there are many ways in which he can have it checked over by a reputable organisation <e> <s> i recommend that potential buyers should have that done <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the director general of fair trading for co-ordinating the views of the bodies representing motor dealers trading standards professionals and others to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> their opinions were studied with great care <e> <s> no doubt we shall receive a response from the director general to our letter putting forward further proposals <e>", "<cs> that is rather a different question <e> <s> we are here discussing the matter of whether the mileage recorded on the speedometer has been tampered with when the car is offered for sale secondhand <e> <s> the industry itself should be working towards producing a tamper-proof mileage recorder or some device that makes it obvious that the recorder has been tampered with <e>", "<cs> my lords the real cruelty in these cases arises from the callousness of those who are willing to place babies and young children at risk in order to use them as camouflage for attempts at drug smuggling <e> <s> women suspected by customs of smuggling drugs may need to be detained for observation or questioning <e> <s> if so children accompanying them are never removed without the mothers permission <e> <s> if the mother agrees child minders are made available to care for the children <e> <s> this can be at the child minders home or if the mother prefers at the airport <e>", "<cs> my lords i should point out that at heathrow in the past three months child minders were needed in only three cases to look after children of suspects detained at customs <e> <s> arrangements for the exchange of prisoners to serve their sentences in their home country exist under a council of europe convention but not all countries are a party to it <e>", "<cs> my lords nigeria is not a party to the council of europe convention <e> <s> i am not exactly clear why it has not become a party but that would be necessary before we could arrange for the exchange of prisoners <e> <s> the figures which i gave were for the number of child minders who were needed to be called on to look after the children of suspects detained at customs <e> <s> it may well be that the figures my noble friend is thinking of apply once the sentence has been served <e> <s> as for my noble friends suggestion of hostels i understand that holloway prison askham grange open prison and the young offenders institution at styal provide places for mothers and babies <e> <s> no baby has been refused admission due to lack of space this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that when a mother is charged with an offence and remanded in custody at holloway a baby under nine months old can stay with her <e> <s> in other cases the local authority takes steps to ensure that the child is cared for preferably by a relative or friend of the mother but otherwise by receiving the child into care <e>", "<cs> my lords i must compliment the noble lord lord mccarthy and his noble friends on one thing <e> <s> the more this bill progresses the fewer the shorter and the simpler do their amendments become <e> <s> the amendment has a disarming simplicity but that is as far as my compliment can go <e> <s> i have to say that we on this side of the house do not agree with the amendment <e> <s> i doubt whether that will come as a surprise to the noble lord <e> <s> i shall explain exactly why we disagree and why we think the amendment should not be made <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the case of injured or sick people would be covered by the remarks i made about sickness <e> <s> the same would apply to an injury <e> <s> i said that it was unlikely that somebody would be taken back <e> <s> however <e> <s> i pointed out that they would have the right to claim unfair dismissal to an industrial tribunal which would hear the case <e> <s> the trouble is that the amendment covers not only that situation but every other kind of dismissal which i have already mentioned <e> <s> the position would be exactly the same in those <e>", "<cs> my lords we are on the third reading of this bill <e> <s> we have already had the noble lords views as regards whether the scheme should be abandoned <e> <s> in answer to the particular case he mentioned as i said in my speech going on strike would not necessarily prevent someone from being eligible for the redundancy scheme <e> <s> on the other hand if someone were dismissed for breach of contract he would not be eligible for the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to repeat all the arguments which were made at second reading and during the other stages of the bill <e> <s> as noble lords have said this is a short bill with one purpose to abolish the dock labour scheme <e> <s> in the words of the noble lord lord rochester the scheme has outlived its usefulness <e> <s> therefore it is not surprising that the arguments have been somewhat repetitive <e>", "<cs> my lords the implementation costs would depend on the measures adopted <e> <s> therefore i cannot put an estimate on the unknown <e> <s> we await the consultants work <e> <s> any new infrastructure in london will of course be costly but i emphasise that the figure of billion which the noble lord mentioned is certainly not an official estimate and is only speculation by the press <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give an assurance that there will be thorough consultations on the report before anything is done <e> <s> those consultations would be with the local authorities involved public transport operators and others <e>", "<cs> my lords i must disabuse the noble lord that the assessment studies are looking purely at roads <e> <s> they are looking at public transport and a number of other means of improving the environment <e> <s> they are certainly not a waste of time <e> <s> the studies are a good way of looking at some of the urgent problems which need to be solved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if the noble lord misunderstood <e> <s> that was exactly what i was trying to say <e> <s> i was explaining to the noble lord lord mcnair that the studies were looking not just at roads but at other matters too <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a matter of argument as regards what should have been done before <e> <s> the fact is that there are problems of acute congestion in parts of london and it is the action of a responsible government to look into ways of improving that <e>", "<cs> my lords mos growth rate has fallen appreciably since last summer <e> <s> the government will continue to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that it reaches and remains within the target range <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i can give my noble friend the assurance that he seeks <e> <s> little mo has proved a reliable indicator of monetary conditions <e> <s> the sixth-month annualised growth rate for last month was per cent <e> <s> obviously i cannot give my noble friend a date when it might come within target but i hope that it will be shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said little mo has proved a reliable indicator of monetary conditions <e> <s> obviously we continue to take broad money particularly m into account in assessment of monetary conditions but there are a number of other factors which need to be taken into account in measuring the performance of the economy <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> indicators have their uses but as i said other things are also important <e> <s> firm monetary policy is the only way to get on top of inflation <e> <s> it has worked in the past and it will work again <e>", "<cs> my lords i should hasten to add that the government do not use those indicators for propaganda purposes <e> <s> i cannot give any information as to any possible revision of targets for future years <e> <s> the noble lord will have to wait and see what the chancellor of the exchequer says in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords i disagree with the noble lord that the governments policy is in disarray <e> <s> we are experiencing an unprecedented growth rate at the moment which i should have thought would be welcome to most people <e> <s> with the benefit of hindsight the loosening of monetary policy post the stock exchange crash in proved to have gone too far but it was a judgment made at the time when the risk of recession was considered to be great <e>", "<cs> my lords at the moment all the indicators whether for imports or anything else are showing strong upward signs <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said firm monetary policy is the only way to get on top of inflation <e> <s> credit controls would not work again <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should have a discussion with the noble baroness to find out what her proposals are <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously excessive wage demands are in themselves inflationary <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said there was a relaxation of monetary policy post the stock exchange fall in <e> <s> with the benefit of hindsight it is clear that the stock market crash was merely a financial phenomenon of little relevance to the real economy <e> <s> however at the time and given the balance of risks the policy was fully justified <e>", "<cs> my lords the forecast presented by the chancellor with his budget in march forecast total business investment to rise by per cent <e> <s> in <e> <s> no forecast for manufacturing investment was given <e> <s> the dtis survey of investment intentions published in june suggested that manufacturers plan to increase investment by per cent <e> <s> in <e>", "<cs> my lords i read the letter to which my noble friend referred <e> <s> we do not regard that as a sensible way to see how the current account deficit could be reduced <e> <s> what matters is how our imports compare with our exports and not our share of world trade <e> <s> however the rapid increase in manufacturing investment in and the continuing strong growth this year will help to improve further the supply side performance <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to the noble lords first question manufacturing investment grew by per cent <e> <s> last year to reach its highest ever level <e> <s> in the previous five years it grew on average by per cent <e> <s> a year whereas under the previous government up to it grew by less than per cent <e> <s> a year <e> <s> with regard to his other point concerning imports i regret that i do not have those figures with me this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the figure as a percentage of gross domestic product <e> <s> however business investment which includes manufacturing investment is now the highest ever recorded proportion of gross domestic product <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that i have given fairly precise answers to the questions that have been put particularly as they relate to the one on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that the figures that i gave for manufacturing investment would seem to prove that to be the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that i do not have a figure for inward investment but of course we welcome inward investment and hope that the latest series of strikes will not affect peoples judgment when they come to make those decisions <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i think it is very fair to say that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the support which the noble lord gives to the orders <e> <s> i shall endeavour to see whether on another occasion we can be more explanatory in the explanatory note <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for the general welcome that noble lords with the possible exception of the noble lord lord monson have given to the order <e> <s> it completes a process that we started last year when we passed the bill which was so ably piloted through the house by my noble friend lord nugent <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly i shall make it my business to be on speaking terms with the appropriate people at london underground in order to pass on my noble friends remarks and those which no doubt i shall hear from others this afternoon <e> <s> london undergound has the responsibility for the efficient functioning of the system <e> <s> it appreciates that the present situation is unsatisfactory and aims to improve the escalator availability as soon as possible <e> <s> inevitably it will take some months <e>", "<cs> my lords that is quite untrue <e> <s> investment in the underground at the moment is at record levels approaching million this year <e> <s> of that sum about million is for the replacement and modernisation of escalators <e> <s> in addition the underground has a continuing repair and maintenance programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i can indicate that in the most recent four-week period for which i have details namely th april to th may there was per cent <e> <s> availability of escalators <e> <s> that is a slight improvement on the preceding four weeks <e> <s> lrts annual business plan commits it to improving the availability of escalators to per cent <e> <s> by the end of next year <e> <s> there are escalators on the system <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said the london underground management is well aware of the problems <e> <s> there are escalators on the underground system <e> <s> the underground is accelerating the rate of replacement from six to between eight and machines a year <e> <s> the fennell recommendations caused of the escalators to be out of service for between three and four weeks for the removal of wood <e> <s> another escalators will need to have their polymer treads replaced <e> <s> each escalator will need to be taken out of service for up to a week for mechanical cleaning <e> <s> that work is part of the implementation of the recommendations made by the fennell report <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said i shall relay the message from your lordships house to the appropriate people in london underground <e> <s> i repeat they are conscious of the problems but there is a large amount of work that needs to be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not certain of the availability of unemployed engineers in the london area <e> <s> maintenance of escalators is progressively being put out to competitive tender <e> <s> the underground is encouraging competition in the supply and installation of new machines to reduce costs and time scales <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that that is a point which needs to be addressed <e> <s> all of the escalators of london transport are having automatic sprinkling systems installed underneath them <e> <s> that programme is due for completion by st december <e> <s> it could be that that work is going on underneath the escalators which would not be apparent to those above <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that passengers have their own means of representation <e> <s> i should point out that three of the directors of london underground board are qualified engineers not necessarily specifically in escalators but certainly in transport-related engineering <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that but it is the engineers who are more likely than the passengers to solve the problem of the escalators <e>", "<cs> my lords that is why london regional transport in responding to the targets set by the department has committed itself to improving the level of availability to per cent <e> <s> by the end of next year <e>", "<cs> my lords to some extent i dispute that <e> <s> i have outlined the various things that have had to be done as a result of the fennell report <e> <s> all escalators have had to have sprinkler systems <e>", "<cs> my lords that is as may be but these recommendations have resulted in a substantial programme of work to the escalator system <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that that target will be reached once the various essential maintenance works have been carried out <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly pass that point on <e>", "<cs> my lords we have no proposals to do so at present but we keep the situation under review <e>", "<cs> in fact my lords the number of heavy goods vehicles exceeding speed limits on our motorways was per cent <e> <s> in the survey and that had dropped to per cent <e> <s> in <e> <s> that is an improvement <e> <s> it is not good enough we agree so that is why we announced earlier this year in the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said we keep the proposals under review <e> <s> i appreciate the work done by the freight transport association and the other body which the noble lord mentioned <e> <s> it is a fact that some operators already fit speed limiters to their lorries <e> <s> it is also a fact that on average a lorry uses per cent <e> <s> less fuel at mph than it does at mph so it is in the operators own interests to keep within the limit <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that tachometers have been fitted to all these heavy vehicles <e> <s> but i do not know to what extent such information can be gleaned from the equipment <e> <s> i shall have to make inquiries and write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures i gave were not concerned with the convictions which were made <e> <s> they came from the national speed survey which checked on the numbers

reception of the amendments <e> <s> as my honourable friend has said education and rehabilitation are important factors <e> <s> indeed the departments main publicity campaign in relation to driving concerns drink driving <e> <s> we take the matter very seriously <e> <s> in making the regulations we shall consult the motoring associations the police the courts etc <e> <s> this was one of the

amendment relates only to the transitional period between the two licensing systems <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that there will not be very much change from what happens at the moment <e>",

urgency in the development of eurocontrol i hope that our actions among others taken during the past months have done a great deal to speed things up <e> <s> we had a fairly momentous decision a

months <e> <s> that is a short time span <e> <s> things are moving in the right direction but there is still much to be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i have heard reports of those difficulties but i have no comment to make at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall not have to wait another year because we have already made the decision <e> <s> we should see signs of progress on the first stages by the beginning of next year <e> <s> we shall have no less than two opportunities at question time next week to discuss airport capacity so i for one know that the issue will not go away <e>", "<cs> my

matters <e> <s> the last date i had in my diary was th october but already the date has changed twice <e>", "<cs> my lords a copy of the commissions point work programme has been deposited in the library of the house <e> <s> the commission has already presented new or revised proposals in the two key areas of export refunds and intervention storage <e>", "<cs> my lords as to the conference to

extremely complicated and difficult issue <e> <s> the question is not just whether we need a new runway but where it should be if one is needed <e> <s> there are complicated air traffic control

but harassed i hope i am not <e>", "<cs> that is right my lords <e> <s> that is why we are firm in our opinion that the advice should be the best advice we can get <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend makes a very good point <e> <s> in stansted will become operational to a much greater extent than it is now <e> <s> therefore effectively it will be a new runway in the london area <e> <s> by when the terminal and the rail link are completed the first phase will handle million passengers a year <e> <s> subject to parliamentary approval that figure will rise to million passengers a year <e> <s> subject to planning approval there could be the possibility of a second terminal which would take it up to about million passengers <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the first part of the noble lords

position on this matter very clear <e> <s> naturally we are in touch also with the united states on these matters <e> <s> we believe that we have a part to play in fostering the peace process <e> <s> i shall of course take note of the noble lords remarks in regard to raising that particular issue with the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords the general reason is alleged security concerns <e> <s> however we do not accept that that is a justification for this measure <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as concerns the closure of the schools they have been progressively reopened since nd july <e> <s> however they remain subject to frequent disruption by curfews and short-term closure orders <e> <s> so the situation there as the noble lord says is not very satisfactory <e> <s> so far as concerns sanctions against israel we do not believe that economic sanctions are a solution to the problems of the middle east <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i have not read the report to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> i shall see if i can find it and have a look at it <e> <s> however we still do not believe that the closure of the schools can be justified by security anxieties <e> <s> we shall continue to speak up against this denial of basic human rights <e>", "<cs> my lords our policy and that of our european friends is based on two fundamental principles first the right of all states in the region including israel to live in security secondly self-determination for the palestinian people <e> <s> we believe that an international conference remains the most appropriate forum for direct negotiations between all the parties concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot say that i have heard of any response from the israeli <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount is quite right <e> <s> it is easy enough to hear views from this chamber about what should or should not be done in this matter <e> <s> in a way that shows how very difficult a problem this is to resolve <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> the ec statement made clear that we believe that the normal functioning of the schools and universities would be a major factor in establishing the climate of confidence that is indispensable for the development of the peace process <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly do not deny the concern expressed by the noble baroness <e> <s> her majestys government will play a role in the financial package discussions and the working group towards the resolution of this problem <e> <s> that is absolutely certain <e> <s> this countrys contribution this year has been the highest ever and certainly we are third in the world in terms of contributions after the commitments of the united states and japan <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a slightly different question from the commissions financial situation to which the question on the order paper refers <e> <s> however the noble lord will be aware that we are in touch with the unhcr as regards the vietnamese boat people <e> <s> while it is looking at the problem of the refugees involved there we would obviously like it to be more concerned about the non-refugees the so-called economic refugees <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not yet read the article to which the noble lord refers but i shall obviously try to find time to extend my reading to that newspaper and in particular to the article by that author <e>", "<cs> my lords aid to vietnam is a very different question from the one on the order paper <e> <s> i am well aware of the views of the british refugee council having heard them at first hand from the noble lord sitting next to the noble baroness on the front bench opposite <e> <s> we shall have an opportunity at question time tomorrow to discuss the situation in hong kong <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend asked a number of questions <e> <s> on the progress of the nationality scheme we are working urgently on a scheme to give the assurance of right of abode to some people in both private and public sectors on the basis of value of service to hong kong as well as connections with the united kingdom <e> <s> our aim is to give to those people whose professional administrative technical and managerial skills are essential to the continued success of hong kong confidence to remain in the territory which was a point raised by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the noble lords first point on the representative government that whole subject is under very active consideration both here and in hong kong <e> <s> we need to reconsider the present plans for the legislative council elections in <e> <s> however we shall want to ensure that the decisions which we take are the right ones and reflect the wishes of the community as a whole <e> <s> of course since june there has been cause for a faster rate of change but no clear consensus within hong kong has yet emerged <e> <s> the omelco proposals are a significant development which has helped to stimulate debate in hong kong <e> <s> we shall wish to see what comes out of those <e>", "<cs> my lords since june we have done everything possible to rally international support for hong kong including the idea of a multinational safety net as part of our efforts to restore confidence in the territory <e> <s> we have raised the matter on numerous occasions including the madrid european council the paris economic <e>", "<cs> my lords the comparison between hong kong and east germany is not entirely relevant <e> <s> the federal german government consider that all germans have a right to settle in the federal republic where in any case many of the newest arrivals already have family or friends <e> <s> british dependent territory citizens however do not have a right of abode in the united kingdom in accordance with the british nationality act <e> <s> the point my noble friend makes that having been given the right to come they may perhaps return is quite a good one <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we wish voluntary repatriation to go as far as possible and a number of people have already returned voluntarily <e> <s> however it is becoming increasingly clear that voluntary repatriation alone cannot provide the comprehensive solution <e> <s> that is why the international community accepted that all those screened out as non-refugees should in due course be returned to vietnam <e>", "<cs> my lords as i indicated earlier the basic law is a matter for the chinese government and members of the basic law drafting committee are appointed by a standing committee at the national peoples congress <e> <s> suspension of the two gentlemen concerned therefore is a matter for the chinese authorities <e> <s> we have made clear to the chinese authorities on a number of occasions our hope that they will take account of the full range of opinion in hong kong in the drafting of the basic law <e> <s> there still remain hong kong members out of a total of on the drafting commitee <e> <s> the point my noble friend makes regarding confidence which i made in my original answer is a valid one in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said we do not rule out reintegration assistance but to qualify for a full programme of aid vietnam must first fulfil its responsibilities towards its own people and to its neighbours <e> <s> there is a lot the vietnamese themselves could do to bring themselves back into the international community and to become more suitable recipients of aid <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have in percentage terms the figure to which my noble friend refers but as i said earlier there are people in hong kong of whom approximately are likely to be screened out as non-refugees <e>", "<cs> my lords in opening this part of the debate on the motion for a humble address i should perhaps begin by saying that i shall concentrate on foreign rather than defence policy questions leaving the latter for my noble friend lord arran to deal with when he winds up <e> <s> this debate is most timely <e> <s> it coincides with dramatic indeed historic events in eastern europe <e> <s> in his reply to the gracious speech yesterday my noble friend lord holderness eloquently expressed the excitement and optimism of us all at these events <e> <s> issues such as these supply the context within which the governments foreign and defence policy is conducted <e> <s> the broad object of that policy for this as for any government is to assure the security of this country its citizens and dependent territories <e> <s> in that term i include national security in both its direct and indirect senses security in both physical and economic terms <e>", "<cs> my lords i respect the fact that the noble lord has a personal interest which is expressed in this question <e> <s> i have to say that successive governments have not answered questions on security or intelligence issues <e> <s> however i can assure the house that the allegations in the publication <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful for the information that the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the bombing to which the noble lord the leader of the opposition referred was investigated at the time <e> <s> the case remains open <e> <s> we expect anyone with evidence of illegal activity in this country to present it to the police <e> <s> if such evidence is presented then of course it will be investigated <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot reply to the noble lords first point concerning calling in the south african ambassador to ask whether the diplomatic bag has been used to transmit explosives <e> <s> presumably that would have happened some little while ago <e> <s> i shall make inquiries about that matter and write to the noble lord <e> <s> furthermore i cannot strengthen the assurance that i gave in reply to the first supplementary question of the noble lord which was that the allegations are completely false <e> <s> i do not think that i can go much further than that <e>", "<cs> my lords i have nothing further to add <e>", "<cs> my lords at the international conference on indo-chinese refugees held in geneva in june resettlement countries pledged sufficient places to ensure the resettlement of all refugees in the region including the in hong kong within three years <e> <s> the united kingdom pledged to resettle a further in addition to the we have accepted from hong kong since <e> <s> so far over have been resettled from hong kong this year <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards hong kong and the uk we consider lists of people suitable for resettlement here drawn up by the united nations high commissioner for refugees <e> <s> those lists include those boat people who have expressed a preference for the united kingdom <e> <s> in this country the home office is responsible for the immediate reception arrangements <e> <s> subsequent resettlement involves the responsibilities of a number of departments and local authorities but the home office has the co-ordinating role <e> <s> it is difficult to estimate the precise number of staff involved and voluntary agencies play a very important role throughout <e> <s> as regards family reunion cases the reunification of families is an important element in our resettlement programme and the first of those selected under those criteria have arrived in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords the question refers specifically to those refugees who have been granted full refugee status <e> <s> therefore it does not refer to the rather larger numbers who are illegal immigrants <e> <s> as regards vietnam i have very little <e>", "<cs> my lords we are on two different points here <e> <s> the question concerns those who have been granted full refugee status <e> <s> the united states has agreed to take a number of those and has so far this year taken over altogether <e> <s> on the matter of the non-refugees neither the united states nor any other country has agreed to take any of them <e> <s> that is of course the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord began his question by saying that we never gave any answers from this front bench <e> <s> i could answer that accusation by saying that the noble lords question is not related to the one on the order paper which deals with those who have been given full refugee status <e> <s> the noble lords question refers to those who have not been given full refugee status <e>", "<cs> my lords the issue was gone through at the geneva conference in june <e> <s> no country agreed to resettle those who were not granted refugee status <e> <s> as i have said that was the vast majority of them <e> <s> the problem is that if countries agreed to take refugees in addition to the that there are now in hong kong there would be another in the next few months and a further after that <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i am aware those negotiations continue <e> <s> that solution would be for those classed as refugees <e> <s> however no decision has yet been taken <e>", "<cs> my lords that is one of the most important factors that we need to take into account <e> <s> the return of the illegal immigrants will be monitored and needs to be monitored to make sure that they are not being persecuted in vietnam <e> <s> so far there is no evidence that that is happening in the case of those who have returned <e>", "<cs> my lords we stray well from the question on the order paper which is about those who are genuine refugees <e> <s> i am sure that <e>", "<cs> my lords we have strayed from the question on the order paper <e> <s> we should return to that question <e> <s> we can discuss the non-refugees on another occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> our only commitment so far is to poland and hungary where reforms are about to take place <e> <s> we have not yet taken a decision on other eastern european countries <e> <s> that would be premature until we are sure that they are firmly embarked on economic and political reform <e>", "<cs> my lords in the last part of that question the noble lord has touched on the real issue <e> <s> that is why we and our partners in the ec and indeed in the group of to which i referred in my original answer are working towards a number of measures including the bilateral projects which i mentioned <e> <s> perhaps the most important of these is an agreement between poland and the imf which may be close <e> <s> that would unlock considerable flows of funds over a number of years from the world bank and other international institutions as will a far reaching re-scheduling in the paris club <e> <s> the uk will play a full and constructive part in these activities <e>", "<cs> my lords i read the words to which the noble lord referred in his question <e> <s> indeed the united kingdom know-how fund for poland is a very good vehicle to encourage polish industry to make itself attractive for investment <e> <s> only last week we doubled the size of that fund from million to million over the next five years <e> <s> in addition to that we shall be financing an agricultural project to the tune of million <e> <s> that is designed to get food into the shops quickly <e>", "<cs> my lords i have referred to the help that the government are giving bilaterally and also that which the european community is giving <e> <s> for private individuals who may wish to help especially in the area of food and medicines a number of charities are involved which i am sure would welcome contributions <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously i cannot give a figure of the amount of the food aid that the european community is giving that has reached its destination yet <e> <s> i am aware of the problem to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> we are concerned about reports of starvation in poland <e> <s> i believe that that is caused by recent price rises which are causing hardship and some under-nourishment in the poorer sections of the population <e> <s> we shall be considering whether the additional deliveries of food being considered by the community could be targeted on such people <e> <s> we shall treat the matter with some urgency <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bonham-carter asked for a specific figure <e> <s> he asked how much of the million ecu of aid promised by the ec has reached poland <e> <s> i must look into the matter and let him know the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to echo that sentiment from this bench <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will have returned by monday because she has tabled a question on the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that the teaching of english is an important part of the process <e> <s> it is also important that english should be the second language not solely for our benefit but also for that of others <e> <s> the british council is carrying out a programe in that area and i know that the bbc world service is greatly appreciated <e> <s> i understand that following the recent public expenditure settlement it is well funded to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that it should make us ashamed of our teaching of languages because all those people speak english so well <e> <s> it appears that somebody is teaching english rather well <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the figure of billion dollars pledged by the federal republic is in export credit guarantees <e> <s> that is not the same as a straight donation which is the case with our know-how fund <e> <s> we are alerting industry in the united kingdom to the opportunities which will arise as a result of the various programmes and we shall continue to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the tragic situation in cambodia and the efforts of the international community to promote peace and stability there in order at long last to bring to an end the sufferings of the cambodian people have rightly been a focus of concern in recent weeks <e> <s> i am therefore also grateful to the noble lord lord molloy for providing this opportunity for the house to debate this important question today <e> <s> i am also grateful to him for agreeing to carry over the debate from the last session <e> <s> as he noted during our debate on the humble address the time is now right for us to take stock <e>", "<cs> my lords the resolution was the united nations resolution <e> <s> the statement was made on th november <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord refers to the aid given to the camps on the border to which i was about to refer <e> <s> as i indicated in my written answer to the question of the noble lord lord molloy we are making a practical commitment to cambodia <e> <s> we have already provided large amounts of humanitarian relief million since for the displaced cambodians in camps along the thai-cambodian border <e> <s> i assure the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs that we have stipulated to the united nations border relief operation unbro that none of the funds we contribute for humanitarian relief to the civilian population of the camps along the border should go to the khmer rouge <e> <s> unbro has assured us that this condition is observed <e> <s> of course the only failsafe way for us to guarantee that nothing we provide reaches the khmer rouge in any form would be to cut off our humanitarian relief altogether <e> <s> i am sure that that is a move which would be advocated by very few people <e>", "<cs> my lords i only hope and i am assured by the united nations that it is not aid provided by the united kingdom government <e> <s> that is the reassurance we have sought and received from the united nations <e> <s> as i say the only way to guarantee that per cent <e> <s> would be to stop giving any aid on the border at all <e>", "<cs> my lords the position of the vietnamese government has not changed <e> <s> they have consistently stated their objection to forcible repatriation and therefore there is no change in that situation <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no question of any boat people being returned to <e>", "<cs> my lords we are certainly concerned we always have been because this is a most important aspect of involuntary repatriation that there should be monitoring of those people who are returned <e> <s> we are satisfied that the conditions in vietnam are adequate for their return and that those who have already returned are not being ill-treated <e> <s> we wish to continue monitoring that <e>", "<cs> my lords the vietnamese government may have been put under pressure by some places <e> <s> they have not done a great deal to improve their own economic circumstances by some of the policies that they have pursued over the years <e> <s> they do not exactly encourage investment and that is why so many of their citizens have chosen to leave the country <e>", "<cs> my lords the problem is that no other country in the world is prepared to accept any of these people who have not been screened out as regards genuine refugee status <e> <s> the geneva conference in june therefore came to the conclusion that there was no other option for them other than to stay in hong kong which would be completely unsatisfactory than to return to their own country <e>", "<cs> my lords we should obviously then have to look again at the question of sending any more back <e> <s> we should have to accept the assurances from the vietnamese that they were treating properly those who had already returned and that would be monitored <e> <s> i have no reason to suppose that they will not be treated properly <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my original answer and i think i covered the point talks with vietnam are still continuing on the detailed final arrangements for involuntary repatriation <e> <s> the views of the vietnamese have always been clear on the subject of the use of force but we have no reason to suppose that the normal procedures to which i referred those which are in line with those applied world-wide in removing persons refused permission to remain will be found objectionable by the vietnamese government <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the vietnamese are content that we should monitor the return of the refugees <e> <s> our aim is to encourage the unhcr to do so but in the first instance our embassy will monitor the returnees <e> <s> we shall then work on longer-term arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously if the vietnamese consider that the measures that are used to return these people involve the use of force that is not our intention as i said in my original answer we shall use procedures that are in line with those which are applied worldwide in these <e>", "<cs> my lords these are standard procedures employed by western countries to remove persons who are refused permission to remain in the country <e> <s> they are often used for the return of illegal immigrants around the world <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i can go any further <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already covered the point concerning aid as regards this issue <e> <s> this question is really concerned with the vietnamese objection to what can be described as forcible repatriation <e> <s> the vietnamese government have agreed to take back these people provided forcible repatriation is not used <e>", "<cs> my lords hope that they will not involve the use of force at all <e> <s> that is the whole point of this argument <e>", "<cs> my lords on rd november the european community granted million ecus in aid and it may be a little too soon to think about a further tranche <e> <s> as regards the murder of the jesuit priests of course we are concerned about the matter and condemn it <e> <s> we believe that the perpetrators should be pursued and brought to justice <e> <s> as regards us aid to el salvador we have no grounds on which to urge the united states to stop such aid <e> <s> the government in el salvador was elected in free elections and the president has publicly committed his government to proper respect for human rights <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend makes some interesting points with which i cannot disagree <e> <s> however we are straying somewhat from the question on the order paper which is to do with humanitarian aid <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly <e> <s> i hope that that item will not appear on the agenda of the meeting <e> <s> we do not normally have bilateral relations with either of the two countries to which the noble lord has referred <e> <s> however sometimes we meet them at international conferences such as this <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give a full answer to the noble lords question because at this stage there is no fixed agenda for the meeting <e> <s> however there will be discussion of ec and arab economic co-operation reform of the dialogues institutions and political issues <e> <s> i understand that as yet there is no fixed agenda <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be allowed to reply to the remarks of the noble lords lord cledwyn and lord bonham-carter <e> <s> i am grateful to them for their reception of the statement that i have repeated <e> <s> i am grateful also to the noble lord lord cledwyn who recognised the difficulties that were faced on this issue <e> <s> the noble lords asked me a number of questions and i shall try to deal with as many as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for his remarks <e> <s> if we have been accused of being heartless in what we have done it would be even more heartless to leave these people in the camps in hong kong <e> <s> no country in the world the united states or any other has agreed to take any of those who are not classed as refugees <e> <s> as my noble friend said the camps are overcrowded and there have already been some cases of disease <e> <s> i pay tribute as i did before to the government of hong kong for what they have done <e> <s> it has been almost impossible to look after the numbers <e> <s> the flow will increase next spring unless the message gets back to vietnam that there is no point in these people coming to hong kong and that no country will take them <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first point of the noble lord lord walston that no other country had agreed to take these people i should remind your lordships that those who are genuine refugees who have been screened in as refugees have all been placed or will be placed in friendly countries around the world <e> <s> that is quite a large number of people <e> <s> this country has taken some from hong kong and we have agreed to take a further of whom the first have begun to arrive <e> <s> the united states incidentally has taken <e> <s> our record on taking those classed as refugees is a good one <e> <s> the noble lord asked why the unhcr did not take part in the screening process <e> <s> it has done so <e> <s> the process was evolved with the co-operation of the unhcr and has been monitored by that body <e> <s> it is an ongoing process which will continue to be monitored by the unhcr <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is right to say that the alternative to returning to vietnam for these people is to be kept in the camps in hong kong in difficult and sometimes dangerous circumstances from a health point of view <e> <s> as i have said before no country in the world has agreed to take these people <e> <s> i take the point made by the noble lord that the chinese should be persuaded to stop letting these people pass through china on their way to hong kong <e> <s> it is certainly true to say nowadays although it may not have been in the past that the great majority leave north vietnam and hug the chinese coast calling in as necessary and some even travel overland and travel only the last leg of the journey by boat <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already covered the first point made by the noble baroness regarding why the operation was carried out so early in the morning <e> <s> it would have been even more of an unpleasant experience for these people had full media attention been given to them <e> <s> i have already said that the group consisted of nine complete families <e> <s> we are not talking about individual children but of nine complete families one single man and three single females <e> <s> i think it is right to keep families together rather than split them up <e> <s> i hope that the house will endorse that approach <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is certainly correct in his last point <e> <s> the point one has to make as i have done is that there is nowhere else for these people to go <e> <s> all the options have been tried <e> <s> they can either stay in the camps in hong kong in conditions which are not particularly good or they can return to their home country <e> <s> i agreed with my noble friend in his comments on the foreign <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord who has a great deal of experience of hong kong <e> <s> i am grateful for the words he used about the feelings in hong kong as a result of the action that we have taken <e> <s> i shall pass on the tributes that the noble lord has paid to those who were involved in the negotiations with the vietnamese government <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly appreciate the noble lords remarks <e> <s> i can assure him that if necessary the embassy in hanoi will be increased in size in order to cope with the job that it has to do there <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> in the position which he held at that time he attended the conference in geneva in june <e> <s> at that time boat people were arriving at a rate of up to a thousand a day <e> <s> i should like to pay tribute again as did my noble friend to the hong kong government and the people of hong kong for the efforts they have made to accommodate those people <e> <s> as my noble friend said no one was pushed away although that was a policy which was advocated by some people <e> <s> as my noble friend said the option to do nothing simply does not exist <e> <s> that was endorsed at geneva in june <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend with his experience of hong kong is quite right to say that the tolerance of the people of hong kong has been stretched almost to breaking point <e> <s> the importance of the repatriation exercise is that the message will get back to the boat people in hong kong who are not refugees that there is no future for them there or anywhere but back home <e> <s> i hope that before the next sailing season the message will also get back to those in vietnam who may be contemplating leaving that country but who are no more than economic refugees that there is no point in leaving <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness and the noble lord for their reception of the statement <e> <s> we are unanimous in condemning general noriega as a brutal dictator <e> <s> as regards us action and its legality the root of the problem was general noriegas defiance of his own people and his refusal to accept the result of the may election <e> <s> it is clear that president endara endorsed the american action <e> <s> general noriega is said to have said that they were in a state of war with the united states <e> <s> president bush said that he took action only as a last resort and for four reasons to protect american lives to defend democracy to arrest an indicted drugs trafficker and to defend the integrity of the panama canal treaties <e> <s> surely there is no suggestion that general noriega represented legality <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for my noble friends support as i am sure will be the american government <e> <s> i have already given the reasons why president bush decided to take such action and i believe that we can agree that they were good reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lords last point i am aware of his question relating to the us justice department <e> <s> it will be answered in due course but i cannot comment upon it against the background of todays actions <e> <s> i understand that the panama canal is now closed <e> <s> i cannot comment on any of the press estimates as regards casualties <e> <s> i have no knowledge of the present whereabouts of general noriega <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with my noble friend lord rippon and we must hope that american action is speedily successful <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot answer that question <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement made in another place on hong kong by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for the reception of the statement <e> <s> as the house will no doubt understand i cannot agree with the noble lord lord mishcon that what one proposes is a completely inept and unjust way of dealing with the situation <e> <s> as the noble lord lord bonham-carter said some insurance policy should be provided and that is what i have explained to the house this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his endorsement of the statement <e> <s> as he said he asked a few questions but i am grateful for his observations <e> <s> he is right to say that what china wants to inherit in is a prosperous hong kong <e> <s> the best way to ensure that is to give some guarantees to the people who stay behind in hong kong <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> the house will be well aware of his great knowledge of hong kong <e> <s> he asked how soon the proposals could be put into effect <e> <s> it could be done as soon as parliament approved the arrangements and the mechanism was in place <e> <s> as the noble lord said the arrangements need to be operatng quickly <e> <s> we shall give the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend who has knowledge of the hong kong business community <e> <s> i am sure he is right to say that the business community will respond favourably to these proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords i am again grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> as my noble friend said the issue of the numbers involved is a sensitive one <e> <s> but i hope noble lords will agree at any rate those on this side of the house that we have achieved a reasonable balance <e> <s> as my noble friend said stability is vital in hong kong and i shall impress upon my colleagues the words of my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i merely say that i am grateful to my noble friend lord boardman <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble and learned friend <e> <s> i hope that when the people of hong kong read the <e>", "<cs> my lords i answered a good many of the questions that the noble lord lord mishcon asked me <e> <s> among the answers i gave was that the details including the selection process will be laid before the house when the legislation is debated <e> <s> no doubt noble lords when the legislation is before the house will have the opportunity to continue with these arguments <e> <s> that is probably about all i can say on the subject this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i agree with my noble friend that we hope that changes in china will go the right way <e> <s> i think that all in your lordships house will agree to that <e> <s> i really cannot add to what i have said so far <e> <s> obviously in a very serious situation we would have to look again <e> <s> but i think it would be unwise at this stage to add to what we have put forward this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords there is very little i can add in response to the points raised by the noble baroness <e> <s> i have already said in reply to the noble lord lord maclehose that we regard this as a matter of some urgency and will therefore move as speedily as we are able <e> <s> so far as concerns the point about the ethnic minorities i can add nothing more to what i have already said in reply to the question of the noble lord lord bonham-carter on that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to noble lords for giving the bill such a warm welcome <e> <s> it has certainly been a useful discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords the certification officer stated in his ruling that the staff federation operates reasonably effectively and in much the same way as many other small trade unions <e> <s> his decision therefore acknowledges that gcsf successfully represents the staff at gchq over per cent <e> <s> of whom have joined the federation <e>", "<cs> my lords the government certainly do not accept that the original decision to ban the trade unions was incorrect <e> <s> in our view it is inappropriate for trade unions to be represented in an intelligence and security agency <e> <s> the position at gchq is no different from that of the police and armed forces <e> <s> on the question of the ilo conventions the government do not accept that they are in violation of those conventions <e> <s> in our view convention cannot stand in isolation from conventions and and article of convention takes precedence over convention <e>", "<cs> my lords we went through all the arguments about gchq nearly five years ago and in the governments view the position has not changed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend is right but it is for gcsf alone to decide whether it wishes to appeal against the decision <e>", "<cs> my lords provided that it remains a federation i do not think that it would <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend makes an interesting point but we went through all those arguments when the unions at gchq were banned some years ago <e> <s> this question is about the staff federation alone <e>", "<cs> my lords that is very much another question <e>", "<cs> with regard to my noble friends first point the ec commission has sent a mission to romania to look at the requirements for food aid <e> <s> in fact it is there today <e> <s> we expect a report back later this week <e>", "<cs> my lords the situation in romania is confused at the moment to say the least but we have no evidence that the aid consigned by her majestys government namely medical supplies has been misdirected <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and i have just referred to the visit of the ec commission to look into the matter of food aid which is taking place this very day <e> <s> in the longer term in partnership with the rest of the ec we hope to help romania move toward democracy and a market economy <e> <s> obviously we shall be discussing those matters with our partners <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that any food has yet been sent <e> <s> it is the purpose of the visit by the ec commission to see what is needed <e> <s> we have already received from the romanian government a kind of shopping list and that is being discussed at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i compliment the noble lord on being able to raise the subject of proportional representation in the context of this question <e> <s> the whole object of the exercise is for the romanians to decide for themselves the form of government and the form of elections that will take place in future <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall play a role through our membership of the european community <e> <s> so far as i understand the aid that is being and will be sent will come from the ec <e> <s> we shall be contributing our per cent <e> <s> share of that <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the ec team which is there today will report back very quickly and we shall be able to take action as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with other noble lords in gratitude to the noble lord lord callaghan for giving the house the opportunity of debating this important subject <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs on his visit to hong kong <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lords lord cledwyn and lord bonham-carter for their reception of the statement <e> <s> both noble lords said that the house will have a greater opportunity to discuss this matter a week today <e> <s> i shall try to deal briefly with the questions that they have put to me <e> <s> as regards democracy my right honourable friend will wish to consider carefully the views expressed to him in hong kong <e> <s> it must be clear that this is a complex issue <e> <s> we wish to be absolutely sure that the decision we make is in the best long-term interests of hong kong <e>", "<cs> my lords i covered the question of democratisation to some extent in my reply to the noble lord lord cledwyn <e> <s> my right honourable friend will be considering carefully the views expressed to him in hong kong <e>", "<cs> my lords our repugnance for the khmer rouge is well known <e> <s> however as i said in my original answer we shall do our best to play our part as a permanent member of the five members of the united nations security council <e> <s> we attended the first meeting in paris on th and th january and we look forward to attending another meeting later this month <e> <s> the australian proposals for greater united nations involvement are currently the best way forward <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the noble lords first point during my visit to thailand recently i visited site two on the border where some or more cambodian refugees or displaced persons live under the united nations border relief organisation <e> <s> i once again made it clear that any funds we provide to that organisation should be solely for the use of those refugees and similar people and that none should go to the khmer rouge <e> <s> i was assured that everything possible is done to prevent such supplies going to the khmer rouge <e> <s> on the second point on the australian proposals as i said there has been one meeting of the permanent five members of the united nations security council and there is a proposal for a follow-up meeting later this month <e> <s> in the meantime i hope that those two members of the permanent five most closely involved will gain agreement from their clients that this is the best way forward <e> <s> we hope in the not too distant future to have a reconvening of the paris conference where all parties could reach a settlement <e>", "<cs> my lords the matter of the occupancy of the united nations seat by cambodia was settled back in october for the time being <e> <s> however we recognise that we shall have to return later to that matter <e> <s> there is no doubt in my mind that that would form a part of the peace <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a difficult question to answer because of what is happening day by day on the ground in cambodia <e> <s> however the current situation is that the phnom penh government hold around per cent <e> <s> of the territory and the resistance groups not just the khmer rouge but also other resistance groups hold about per cent <e> <s> it appears i can only say that it appears to be the case that there is more or less stalemate on the ground at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the need for urgency which the noble lord has expressed <e> <s> however the meeting of the five permanent members on the australian proposals was a good sign <e> <s> china is one of those permanent members <e> <s> therefore we should draw encouragement from the fact that china put its name to the -point plan that came from that meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> one of the matters that the ec is concentrating on is the supply of medical assistance <e> <s> the commission held a meeting of the group of donor countries on th january to discuss further medical assistance <e> <s> the united kingdom emphasised the urgent need for that to be brought forward <e>", "<cs> my lords we have been providing precisely that kind of help to poland particularly through the know-how fund <e> <s> there are currently a large number of projects that are in hand or are to be implemented or completed <e> <s> i shall be happy to send the noble lord a list of those projects and place a copy in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords food aid has featured highly on the list of priorities <e> <s> the ec has already contributed million ecus in the first tranche and last month announced a further million of food aid <e> <s> in addition to that community project assistance for poland and hungary worth million ecus has been announced and the united kingdom has also provided a food project worth million <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord makes a good point and i shall certainly draw it to the attention of my right honourable friend <e> <s> however we are helping on an international basis principally through the group of whose efforts are being co-ordinated by the european commission <e> <s> that is achieving quite good practical results in the short term <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly <e> <s> so far as concerns environmental problems we and our european partners have set aside between million and million of the ecs project assistance for poland and hungary this year for environmental assistance <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all noble lords admire the work that the noble baroness does in poland <e> <s> i shall certainly bear in mind very carefully what she has said today <e> <s> i have already referred to assistance with medical supplies but i shall take account of what she said <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i can give the noble lord some encouragement <e> <s> i have already referred to the group of countries which have declared their willingness to respond to the needs of other countries in eastern europe as well as poland and hungary <e> <s> we have already announced that our know-how fund will be extended to other countries in eastern europe as and when they make a firm commitment to democracy <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not seen the story to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> the know-how fund is directed towards politicians of all kinds <e> <s> groups of hungarian and polish politicians have already participated in successful seminars on the uk parliamentary system organised by the great britain-east europe centre <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords will be grateful for the information which my noble friend has provided on the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords trade is principally a subject for the judgment of commercial companies <e> <s> it is for them to decide whether to invest in poland <e> <s> the know-how fund to which i have already referred gives assistance to people such as those to whom the noble lord referred to learn how to operate in a market economy <e>", "<cs> my lords the aid is not given to individual companies <e> <s> the know-how fund is aimed at teaching people how to run companies <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that it is for the government to make british industry aware of the opportunities <e> <s> british industry is obviously well aware of the changes <e> <s> no one could not be aware of what is going on in eastern europe <e> <s> i am sure that companies will take advantage of the opportunities when they are presented to them <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the first part of the question i should say that as one of the founding fathers if i may put it like that of the treaty i do not think that our support for it has ever been in doubt <e> <s> however if the noble lord detects a difference of emphasis so be it <e> <s> the review conference to which the noble lord referred will take place in geneva in august and september <e> <s> the initial two preparatory committee meetings which were held in new york last may and in geneva last september went well <e> <s> the third preparatory committee meeting will take place in geneva from th april to th may <e> <s> the depositary powers <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i answered a question on a comprehensive test ban treaty as recently as last november <e> <s> a comprehensive test ban treaty remains a long-term goal but progress will be made only by a step-by-step approach which takes account of technical advances in verification as well as progress elsewhere in arms control and the attitude of other states <e>", "<cs> my lords for the foreseeable future our security will depend on deterrence based in part on nuclear weapons <e> <s> we must continue to test our nuclear weapons to ensure that they remain effective and up to date <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that there is much i can add this afternoon or to what i said in answer to the noble lords previous question on the subject in november <e> <s> it remains our long-term gaol but with certain qualifications <e>", "<cs> my lords we utterly condemn the use of chemical warfare <e> <s> we played a leading role in the drafting of un resolution which followed the barbaric acts at halabja <e> <s> the poisoning to which the noble baroness referred was the subject of an article in the <e>", "<cs> my lords naturally we are concerned at the treatment of kurds in all of the countries to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> we have made strong representations in all cases <e> <s> i am not aware of the incident at manchester airport which he mentioned <e> <s> i shall try to find the answer and let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure about the specific example given by my noble friend <e> <s> however there is no doubt that the turks do not allow kurds to use their own language <e> <s> the turks must be fully aware of their obligations under the concluding document of the conference on security and co-operation in europe <e> <s> i understand that the subject is under discussion in turkish political circles <e> <s> we should let those discussions take their course and hope for a favourable result <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said we have made clear our attitude to iraqs abuses of human rights <e> <s> we continue to trade with iraq <e> <s> i am not sure what was the purpose of the health ministers visit but i am sure that it is not a good idea to cut off iraq completely <e> <s> it is better to maintain dialogue <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> we are pleased that the turkish government have provided humanitarian assistance both to the kurdish and the bulgarian refugees who have come into turkey <e> <s> the government have donated a total of of aid towards those causes <e>", "<cs> my lords the united kingdom and other western countries took the lead in co-sponsoring a firm and unambiguous resolution on iraq at the last meeting of the united nations commission on human rights <e> <s> naturally we are disappointed that an iraqi procedural motion meant that the resolution was blocked <e> <s> iraq is in no doubt about our concern over human rights abuse <e> <s> we shall continue to pursue the issue bilaterally and in international fora including the ec <e> <s> ambassadors in baghdad made a collective protest to the iraqi authorities last june <e>", "<cs> my lords we expect the turkish government to treat all their citizens with due regard to the terms of the relevant international conventions to which turkey is a party <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i consider it a generous contribution from one country <e> <s> we are not the only people who should be expected to contribute to such funds <e> <s> if everyone else contributed it would add up to a good deal <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that we have condemned iraqs human rights abuses unambiguously and on many different occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not heard of any <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with my noble friends last remarks about the importance of the commonwealth <e> <s> i was aware of my noble friends involvement in new zealand in britain having seen him at various events in connection with it <e> <s> i also endorse that the commonwealth games were a great success in the city of auckland <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure about having an early day motion in your lordships house <e> <s> we do not have such procedure <e> <s> however i am sure that the remarks made during questions in this house today will endorse your lordships support for the commonwealth <e>", "<cs> my lords i endorse that remark <e> <s> it will be the first commonwealth day that has occurred since pakistan rejoined the commonwealth i think last october <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the noble lord the leader of the opposition on once again bringing wales to the forefront of our attention and also the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state for wales <e> <s> i am sure that due consideration will be given to what the noble lord said <e> <s> i shall pass his remarks on to the present secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware that my noble friend was giving such an address <e> <s> however i am sure that it will be most useful to all those who are able to listen to it <e>", "<cs> my lords we have certainly taken note of the european parliaments resolutions <e> <s> our views on the occupied territories are well known and i do not believe that they need repetition this afternoon <e> <s> we do not feel that the closure of the universities is in any way justified <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much agree with the noble lord <e> <s> the closure of the universities does nothing to assist the peace process in fact the reverse <e> <s> we are slightly encouraged to learn of the decision of th february to re-open the community colleges which is at least a step in the right direction <e>", "<cs> my lords i am encouraged to hear that <e> <s> we certainly deplore the continued closure of the universities but we welcome the other steps taken to open the community colleges and the schools <e> <s> we do not believe that the closure of the universities is justified by security concerns <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord lord mayhew heard the remarks of the noble lord lord glenamara <e>", "<cs> my lords that may well be the case i do not know <e> <s> i can only answer for this government not the israeli government <e> <s> this government do not feel that the closure is justified our views on the occupied territories have been well stated on many occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords i can do no more than repeat that in our view closure is not justified by security concerns <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot say that the british council has been operating in the occupied territories <e> <s> i can say that the ec aid effort in the strasbourg declaration resolved substantially to increase aid to the occupied territories and declared that the education and health sectors would be given priority <e>", "<cs> my lords we have made clear to the sri lanka government our concerns about human rights abuses in sri lanka <e> <s> our high commissioner discussed the matter with president premadasa on th february <e> <s> we welcome the positive measures which the president has taken recently <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all noble lords will deplore what happened in sri lanka and what the noble lord has just described <e> <s> the sir lankan government are in no doubt about british concern for human rights and for what has been happening <e> <s> we must recognise that the government there have been seeking not without success to overcome a ruthless challenge to the survival of the democratic system <e> <s> however the measures taken to preserve democracy and the rule of law must not end up by undermining them <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the house that the fullest consideration was given to the case of mr mendis when he was here <e> <s> the case was subject to the most stringent review by the independent appellate authorities the courts and my right honourable friend the home secretary <e> <s> the view that mr mendis was not a refugee was also shared by the london representative of the united nations high commission for refugees <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i did not mean to imply that those measures were taken as a result of the meeting with our high commissioner <e> <s> among the measures taken was the invitation to the international committee of the red cross to monitor events and report its findings <e> <s> its team arrived in october last year <e> <s> more recently initiatives have been taken to repeal the regulation under emergency powers allowing the security forces to dispose of bodies without inquest or notification <e> <s> there has been recognition of the need to disband vigilante groups and a deadline has been set for the surrender of unlicensed arms <e> <s> those are moves in the right direction <e>", "<cs> my lords our aid programme is intended to benefit the poorer sections of the tamil and sinhalese communities <e> <s> we have not yet made any linkage between our aid programme and the human rights situation <e>", "<cs> my lords the number of directly elected seats in remains open <e> <s> we have not agreed to seats for but have said that the number will be at least <e> <s> the improvement that we secured in the latest move was a commitment to provide seats in in in and the possibility that full direct elections can be introduced in <e> <s> that is a considerable improvement on previous proposals put forward by the chinese government which provided for no more than directly elected seats in and no commitment to further progress <e>", "<cs> my lords the current proposal in the basic law as drafted by the chinese government is that there should be seats in the date to which that number refers <e> <s> we should like to see more and for that reason we have stated a minimum of seats <e> <s> it will be most important to see the outcome of the elections <e> <s> they will be a substantial and important step forward in democracy in hong kong and we should not play down their significance <e> <s> it is important that the elections should be seen to be a success and that they should reassure the chinese that they have nothing to fear from democracy in hong kong <e> <s> obviously some people in hong kong would have wished to see a faster rate of democratisation <e> <s> however there is also a sense of relief that a major uncertainty for the future of the territory has been removed <e>", "<cs> my lords under the terms omelco wished to have two more seats in <e> <s> however there is a sense of relief that a major uncertainty has been removed <e> <s> as regards the further provision to which i referred in answer to the noble lord lord wyatt the draft provides for seats in in and the possibility of full direct elections in <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and gallant lord has made a good point particularly in referring to the statement made by one of the representatives of omelco <e> <s> as i said it is important that the elections go ahead and that the chinese see that they have nothing to fear from the process <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect we have had such arguments on many occasions <e> <s> we believe that we did the best that we could for hong <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot answer for the chinese government i can answer only for the british government <e> <s> however i take to heart the point made by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords when discussing the move to democracy in hong kong there is no point in trying to impose something which will not go beyond <e> <s> we could do whatever we liked between now and then but if it is something with which the chinese obviously do not agree they will just sweep it away in <e> <s> we want to see something which will continue beyond that date into the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for the reception given by the noble lords lord cledwyn and lord tordoff to the statement <e> <s> it shows that the house is united in its condemnation of what the iraqis propose to do <e> <s> like the noble lord lord cledwyn i do not wish to go into too much detail this afternoon <e> <s> our main primary and perhaps sole consideration at the moment should be to do everything possible to work for the release of mr bazoft and mrs parish or for having another look at the sentences passed on them <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said we have enlisted support from the world community and in particular the european community <e> <s> the ec troika made that representation on behalf of the whole community <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord callaghan for the remarks that he has made <e> <s> as i said earlier it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i was certainly able to point out the concern which nepals friends felt over the violence which had taken place when i discussed the situation with the prime minister and foreign minister <e> <s> of course i was able to say how much we regretted the violence between the police and those who demonstrated for greater political representation <e> <s> i did not raise specifically the issue of the release of detainees <e> <s> i understand that the government released people on rd february and a further number in march <e> <s> therefore something along those lines has happened <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have outlined it is a fact that there have been serious demonstrations and outbreaks of violence <e> <s> the nepalese government have to react in such situations but it could be argued that they need not react quite as they did as a result of which a number of people lost their lives <e> <s> that was of course most regrettable <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not have discussions with the opposition parties in nepal <e>

may be taking things just a little too far <e> <s> as i said there was <e>", "<cs> my lords the demonstrations were dealt with quite strongly i think <e> <s> that resulted in some loss of life about

around but there is nothing which i might be able to use as an official figure <e>", "<cs> my lords the people vote for individuals rather than parties <e> <s> it is not for me to justify nor to criticise their system <e> <s> i happen to know that for instance a by-election will take place any day now at which there are no fewer than nine candidates for a seat <e> <s> that is one form of holding an election <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> we have repeatedly reminded the spanish government that their refusal to allow the ferry service to operate is contrary to european community law <e> <s> we have now made a formal complaint to the commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the spanish government tried to link this measure with that on the airport agreement which has not yet come into force either <e> <s> we do not believe that there is any such link <e> <s> they are two entirely separate agreements <e> <s> in any case the agreement has to some extent been overtaken by the ec regulation which <e>", "<cs> my lords we have repeatedly urged the spaniards to allow the ferry service between gibraltar and algeciras to be resumed in accordance with the declaration to which my noble friend referred <e> <s> however we have failed in our attempts to persuade them to do that <e> <s> that is why we have now started a formal complaint with the european commission <e>", "<cs>

repeated the statement i should like to associate myself with much of what has been said in the house this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords the students to whom i referred in the statement are the

with iraq <e> <s> i believe that it is important now more than at any time for the sake of mrs parish and mr richter not to mention the other or so britons who live in iraq that we should have diplomatic relations with that country <e> <s> we do not intend to expel the iraqi ambassador <e> <s> we are bringing back our ambassador to consult him about the wider implications of our relations

trying to get across <e>", "<cs> my lords we welcome reports that the urng and the national reconciliation commission have met in oslo and we hope that the dialogue will continue <e> <s> i gather that that took place at the weekend so as yet i have no reports on the progress made <e> <s> we have contributed to the national dialogue which was set up to achieve national reconciliation <e> <s> that

countries capable of producing <e>", "<cs> my lords only a comprehensive effectively verifiable ban on the development production possession and use of chemical weapons which is now being negotiated

significant differences of opinion about the proposals in the bill so that we in your lordships house can demonstrate a united approach in the fight against international terrorism <e> <s> i am grateful also to those who welcomed me back to this role <e> <s> however i cannot help being reminded of the night of the lockerbie accident which was one of the most harrowing events that i have ever had to attend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether the requirements relating to membership of the various associations training and so forth will apply to ports <e> <s> i must come back to the noble lord about that <e>", "<cs> the government fully accept the principle that the aerodrome manager needs to be aware of any security requirements laid upon airport users as they affect the overall security of operations at the airport <e> <s> he has an important role which the noble lord lord underhill has outlined <e> <s> he has a co-ordinating function and chairs <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to the arguments deployed by the noble lords lord underhill and lord tordoff and by my noble friend lord mountevans <e> <s> the amendment appears to me to address two questions first whether the government should reimburse the cost of aviation security out of taxpayers money and secondly whether in doing so they should pay special regard to the particular problems of small airports <e> <s> i cannot see any provision in the amendment to state that the government should reimburse the cost of airport security as the noble lord lord underhill proposed <e> <s> as i understand it the amendment merely states that the secretary of state shall have regard to the financial implications of that matter <e>", "<cs> i cannot <e> <s> i said that i did not have a full list of security costs <e> <s> i may be able to find that out but i am not sure whether southend is sufficiently large to fall within the net of the national aviation security committees work <e> <s> however as i said to my noble friend lord mountevans at second reading financial implications are taken into account <e> <s> the rules are not the same for the heathrows and gatwicks of this world as they are for some of the regional airports <e> <s> i am not keen to give specific examples of where the differences lie but the committee can be reassured that there are differences in the security requirements <e>", "<cs> section of the aviation security act as amended by paragraph of schedule to the bill provides that an enforcement notice will have effect notwithstanding anything contained in any other act or rule of law <e> <s> that means that aviation security considerations have to be paramount <e> <s> i believe that that is right <e> <s> the clause <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord tordoff for that response <e> <s> i hope that he will find that it fully satisfies the points that were raised both in another place and by the noble lord at second reading <e>", "<cs> i do not think there is a great deal that i can add on this amendment to the extensive quotations given by the noble lord lord underhill regarding the exchanges which occurred in another place <e> <s> i would just say that in response to calls for removing discriminatory provisions which apply differently as between british and foreign ships we introduced an ability to give directions to a master <e> <s> the main intention is that such powers would be used only where it proved impossible to locate the operators of ships usually foreign registered <e> <s> assurances to this effect were given in another place <e>", "<cs> in response to the amendment perhaps i may give some thoughts on how clause will work <e> <s> we shall be giving directions and enforcement notices to masters only <e>", "<cs> these amendments cover two specific points <e> <s> one is the use or future use of the ports police authorities and the other is the use of private security firms in the ports <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord tordoff for his remarks <e> <s> as he suggested i believe i covered these points in my speech concerning amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> we are now talking about the maritime rather than the aviation side of the bill <e> <s> my amendments nos <e> <s> and which we shall reach in a moment answer all the questions that the noble lord lord underhill asks in his amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> the proposed amendment to clause would effectively hamstring attempts to improve security <e> <s> in many cases where a direction has not been complied with by a ship operator the only effective way of getting the necessary work carried out is to place an obligation on the master <e> <s> the master would have the right to object to the enforcement notice if he felt he could not or should not have to comply with it <e> <s> further there is a reasonable excuse defence contained in clause the offences clause to assist in such cases where the master was unable to meet the terms of the enforcement notice <e>", "<cs> i note what the noble lord lord tordoff has said and i shall read carefully what the noble lord lord underhill said when he introduced the amendment <e> <s> however i have no reason to believe at the moment that the balance is not right <e>", "<cs> i listened with care to the words of the noble lord lord underhill when he moved the amendment <e> <s> however i am concerned that in intending to protect maritime operators from the supposed unwarranted attention of inspectors the amendment in effect exposes the industry to the worst of all positions in the struggle against terrorism namely being unprepared <e> <s> if we are to protect the industry effectively powers must be available to see what type of action is required <e> <s> that includes determining whether to give directions <e> <s> the people carrying out inspections will be trained department of transport staff <e> <s> they are the authorised persons referred to in the bill and have specialist knowledge of security matters and have worked with the industry in this area already <e> <s> they will in line with the general approach to be taken on security matters seek to work with the industry in close co-operation and consultation <e> <s> the disputed powers in clause will it is hoped only be used where all other attempts to obtain accurate information have proved fruitless <e> <s> nonetheless such contingency powers are very necessary as the secretary of state may require his staff to visit certain operations and sites to see at first hand what types of directions need to be made both on a general basis and specifically for individual operators <e>", "<cs> i have examined this proposal closely as i understand the concern which the noble lord lord underhill has shown in the amendment <e> <s> we are concerned with the security aspects here <e> <s> however clause has a specific purpose to deal with putting questions about cargo and so or and full statements either oral or written being given in reply <e> <s> the clause is not designed to cover all types of documentation and errors made intentionally or recklessly <e> <s> the direction-making powers elsewhere in the bill should be adequate to ensure that cargo carriers and collectors carry out procedures to implement effective security practices <e> <s> however if those are not sufficient powers are available in clause to introduce regulations to cover the activities of sea cargo agencies <e> <s> i hope that with that assurance the noble lord will feel that his points have been covered <e>", "<cs> i believe that i have given the reason why we do not think the amendment would add to the bill <e> <s> i shall have another look at it and perhaps give the noble lord a more detailed reply than i have been able to do this evening <e> <s> i think that my answer will in the end be the same but i shall certainly come back to the noble lord on the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords although i have not yet seen the film of the demonstrations i am aware of what took place in red square this morning <e> <s> we and our western allies are deeply concerned about the future of lithuania but nobody including the lithuanians would profit from a deterioration in east-west relations at a stage when crucial negotiations on european security are taking place <e> <s> we underline the need for a purposeful dialogue between the two parties aimed at reaching an agreement acceptable to all concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with what the noble lord the leader of the opposition said in the first part of his question <e> <s> of course we should not be in the present situation were it not for the recent measures which mr gorbachev has taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i was referring to the criteria for the recognition of states <e> <s> as i said that applies to the recognition of lithuania as an independent state <e> <s> those criteria are that a state should have and should seem likely to continue to have clearly defined territory with a population a government who are able to exercise control over that territory and independence in their external relations <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the latter part of the noble lords question <e> <s> the letter from chancellor kohl and president mitterrand reflects the wishes of the west to see a constructive dialogue started as soon as possible <e> <s> both sides must move if that is to happen and we certainly agree with the sentiments expressed in that letter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not certain that i wish to indulge in that sort of speculation <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord wyatt heard the question from the noble lord lord jenkins but i do not intend to comment on it <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my original answer we have never recognised the legality of the incorporation of the baltic states into the soviet union in <e> <s> the soviet union is well aware of our attitude to that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords there is much that i agree with in what the noble lord lord molloy says <e> <s> we should like to see lithuania regain its independence which was illegally taken away in <e> <s> the best way to do that is by peaceful negotiation with president gorbachev and the soviet union <e> <s> the fact that lithuania is in difficulty at the moment with the blockades and so on proves that it is no that simple just to declare independence <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall be best occupied in looking to the present time and the future rather than going back into the history to which the noble lord referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i can comment on the details which the noble lord lord kennet asked in his question <e> <s> it is true that there is the possibility of secession under the law of the soviet union and that is the path which lithuania should be adopting <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that that is of great interest to the house <e> <s> i do not think that we are in a position to take any military action to assist the lithuanians even if we wished to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords no language qualifications are required by applicants to the diplomatic service <e> <s> the service looks for candidates to show aptitude and interest in learning languages which are then brought on as necessary with targeted language training <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason we do not restrict applicants to the diplomatic service to those who already have a language qualification is twofold <e> <s> first it would considerably restrict our recruitment at a time when competition for high quality graduates is intense <e> <s> secondly there is no evidence that language students make better diplomats than non-language students <e> <s> it is easier to train a recruit who is good in other respects to learn a language than it is to turn someone with a language qualification into a diplomat if he does not have the basic characteristics for diplomacy <e>", "<cs> certainly my lords <e> <s> i should hope that as they are all graduate entrants they should be fully qualified to speak english <e>", "<cs> my lords i can answer both questions <e> <s> last year per cent <e> <s> of administrative grade new entrants had pure language degrees and a further per cent <e> <s> had degrees involving languages <e> <s> with regard to resources allocated to training new staff as i have said per cent <e> <s> of the administrative grade new entrants are given intensive language training for specific postings after their first year or two in the diplomatic service others receive training at a later stage in their career <e> <s> all officers are given pre-posting language training as necessary which involves training in the united kingdom and may involve immersion training depending on the language and the level the officer is required to reach <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his observation <e> <s> i know that he takes a close interest in japanese matters <e> <s> as i said new entrants have months training in the united kingdom followed by months training in japan providing unique qualifications compared with others <e>", "<cs> my lords nowadays we refer to them as spouses of course <e> <s> all officers and their spouses are entitled to hours tuition in the language of the country to which they are to be posted and also tuition in french german and spanish <e>", "<cs> my lords without wishing to ask the name of the person to whom the noble lord refers there is not much i can say in reply to his question <e>", "<cs> my lords it is likely to be done when the process of consultation is complete <e> <s> this has taken longer than expected but much progress has been made in the past year <e> <s> the protocols are long and legally complex <e> <s> the united kingdom must be clear on the obligations it would undertake before making a decision <e> <s> i can tell my noble friend that in regard to the civil defence <e>", "<cs> no my lords i cannot answer that question without notice <e> <s> i think that it is a little distant from the question which appears on the order paper <e> <s> however i shall try to find the necessary information and inform the noble lord accordingly <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am aware of that fact <e> <s> however it applies only to civil defence in times of war <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> that question is also a long way from the one which appears on the order paper which asks whether we shall ratify this particular protocol <e> <s> i am afraid that i do not have the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords it depends upon what we are consulting <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord is disappointed with my reply <e> <s> we do give priority to the issue <e> <s> we support the major multilateral organisations that is the united nations population fund the international planned parenthood federation and the world health organisations human reproduction programme <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that it is indeed one of the biggest problems facing the world at present <e> <s> i also agree with the figures he quoted in his supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords we already have a substantial aid programme <e> <s> much of it indirectly helps slow population growth because it improves economic and social prospects for the poorest which in turn reinforces the desire for smaller families <e> <s> we are ready to do more <e> <s> bilateral spending is of course dependent upon recipient governments giving population growth a high priority in their own plans <e> <s> we are encouraging them to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords we give the matter a high priority <e> <s> we take account of the role of women in all parts of our aid programme and shall continue to do so <e> <s> as i have said we are ready to do more bilaterally if we can persuade as we are trying to do recipient governments to give the problem a high priority <e>", "<cs> my lords we are involved multilaterally in the problem of overseas debt which is a subject different from the one we are discussing today <e> <s> as i said earlier through our aid programme we seek to improve the economic and social prospects of the poorest which helps with the population problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of the united states position with regard to the ippf <e> <s> i shall take note of what the noble lord said <e> <s> the ippf is the largest single recipient of the funds that i have described this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble baroness makes a good point in her first question <e> <s> part of our funding goes towards research <e> <s> in we spent directly on research and a further on training awards <e>", "<cs> my lords it is of course a difficult problem <e> <s> we recognise that it is a sensitive issue in many countries <e> <s> fortunately it is probably <e>", "<cs> my lords our aid programme currently standing at i - billion has not been decreased in cash terms over the past few years <e> <s> it is a substantial programme which is extremely well targeted and well spent <e>", "<cs> my lords we are currently reviewing the question of united kingdom funding of the international institute for applied systems analysis <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said we are reviewing the situation at the moment <e> <s> we withdrew our funds in because the scientific community doubted the value of the institutes work <e> <s> the strength of the scientific case will be the deciding factor in our decision whether to renew funding which we hope to take later this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the first part of the noble lords question that stable economic conditions for the soviet union and the eastern bloc are important in terms of world peace especially in the soviet union <e> <s> we have to decide whether rejoining the institute is the best way forward <e> <s> that is why we are seeking from vienna further information on the institutes programmes and are consulting government departments and research bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that we were being positive by reviewing whether to rejoin the institute <e> <s> we have been out of it since for good reasons <e> <s> we are now looking into whether we should rejoin <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> that is the point that i was trying to make to the noble lord lord cledwyn <e>", "<cs> my lords the cost of the visa is the same worldwide <e> <s> it is not biased against poland or any other country <e> <s> the cost for a single entry visa is the same worldwide and has not changed in the case of east european countries since november <e> <s> as regards the charge not being refundable if an application is refused i should say that the cost of considering an application and interviewing the applicant is the same regardless of whether entry clearance is granted or refused <e>", "<cs> my lords last year applications rose by per cent <e> <s> to <e> <s> in the first quarter of this year they have risen by a further per cent <e> <s> as regards the time it takes to process applications over the counter same-day issues now account for per cent <e> <s> of all visa issues <e> <s> that is in itself a great improvement over recent months <e> <s> i do not think i have a figure for the number of applications which were refused but that was the total number which were applied for <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i answered that question in my first reply <e> <s> a single entry visa costs <e>", "<cs> my lords the figure is <e> <s> as i said the charge is the same worldwide <e> <s> as i said earlier that is the cost to us of considering the application and interviewing the applicant and it is the same irrespective of whether the entry clearance is granted or refused <e> <s> it is the same as when someone <e>", "<cs> my lords we charge the same all over the world regardless of whether the application is made in eastern europe or any other country whose citizens need visas to come here <e> <s> there have been illegal immigrants from poland who have come here on visitor visas and been discovered to be working <e> <s> that is why we need a visa system <e> <s> we also have an obligation to meet the costs of issuing visas from the revenue that they raise <e>", "<cs> my lords i obviously cannot possibly answer the first part of the noble lords question <e> <s> i should have thought that most of the visa applications were from younger people <e> <s> we have discretion to make special arrangements for certain groups and we shall continue to look at further ways of improving the system <e> <s> however the fact remains that we have an obligation to match our costs with our resources and we charge the same amount all over the world <e>", "<cs> my lords not so far as i am aware <e>", "<cs> my lords their charges are lower than ours <e> <s> however our system is slightly different <e> <s> it relies on checks prior to issue and on entry rather than on post-entry checks <e> <s> if a person receives a visa to come to this country he is not further pursued once he gets here <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord if i misunderstood him although i do not believe that i did <e> <s> i did not understand him to be suggesting that the visa regime should be abolished <e> <s> if the noble lord felt that that was what i said i did not mean to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been trying to answer the question for the last five minutes <e> <s> the noble lord will have to make his own assessment <e> <s> we do not discriminate against any country in terms of the charges that we make <e> <s> we charge them all the same <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be the noble lords understanding <e> <s> however as i have tried to explain we make the same charge in every country <e> <s> if we were to charge variable amounts in different countries where would that end <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of an article in that context which my noble friend referred to me <e> <s> i wrote to my noble friend with what i believe to be an entirely satisfactory reply <e> <s> our staff do their best to be courteous at all times <e> <s> we have increased their numbers to cope with the increased demand for visas <e> <s> the fact that over applications were received last year and the number is still rising must mean that even our costs are not prohibitive <e>", "<cs> on the contrary my lords <e> <s> my noble friend may recall that he wrote to me about the article on the subject of alleged rudeness by our officials in the embassy in warsaw <e> <s> i replied to him with a full response <e>", "<cs> my lords during the committee stage the noble lord lord underhill moved an amendment in terms similar to the proposed new subsection <e> <s> the proposed new subsection i believe seeks to address a point to which i referred when replying to the noble lords amendments <e> <s> i said that the secretary of state will not necessarily know whether a person issued with a direct on because of access to one airport was subsequently allowed access to another <e>", "<cs> my lords the proposed new clause seems to be concerned with the same issues as the amendment moved by the noble lord lord underhill in committee <e> <s> it implies that the secretary of state should be informed about the cost of security measures and should take them into account before making directions <e> <s> in particular this amendment seems to be suggesting that the government should pay special regard to the special <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened carefully to the speech made by the noble lord lord underhill and the supporting remarks of the noble lord lord murray <e> <s> however i must say that this and previous similar amendments have sought to exclude or reduce the effects the clause has on one particular group notably the masters <e> <s> i can see no reason for this preferential treatment <e> <s> my colleagues and i have already given assurances that we will not single out masters for undue attention simply because of their accessibility <e> <s> however that does not mean they can have such safeguards cast in stone when the effect would be so to limit the secretary of states powers that he would be unable to exercise <e>", "<cs> my lords in committee the noble lord lord underhill wanted the assurances i had given him written into the bill and i note that the amendment before us also attempts to limit the secretary of states scope of action by casting those assurances in a legal framework <e> <s> i have considered his points carefully once more but i feel unable to go any further than to reiterate the ample assurances already given <e> <s> in my opinion it is totally wrong to frame security legislation in such detail that it fails to recognise the need for flexibility to cater for the situations some of which we cannot anticipate upon which the secretary of state may need to act <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should say that the secretary of state is an omnipotent person in these cases <e> <s> however what we are talking about are the representatives of the secretary of state or the inspectors on the ground or at the ports <e> <s> those are the people to whom a master would be able to make his representations <e> <s> i can only assure the noble lord that those representatives will always be willing to listen to a masters views <e> <s> we do not wish to antagonise masters <e> <s> we want to do what we think is best for maritime security <e> <s> obviously we want to work with the masters rather than against them <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house that will apply to private dwellings <e> <s> they will only be allowed to be searched by a constable <e> <s> the explanation which the noble lord lord underhill sought is that constables who are <e>", "<cs> my lords we have pressed the commission for a reply on this matter on numerous occasions since we wrote on th february <e> <s> we have not yet received a reply <e> <s> so far as concerns direct action by the government before the european court of justice we shall consider action under article of the treaty of rome at the appropriate time <e> <s> for the moment it is for the commission to decide whether there is a case against spain under article <e>", "<cs> my lords we have kept in close touch with the chief minister in gibraltar on the ferry agreement <e> <s> the airport agreement we believe is a good deal for gibraltar and does not comprise any concessions to sovereignty <e> <s> what we are talking about in the question is a different route to get to the ferry agreement <e> <s> we believe that there is no linkage between the ferry agreement and the airport agreement <e> <s> but the spaniards as we are all aware take the opposite view <e> <s> that is why we have taken the other route so far as concerns the ferry services invoking an ec regulation on the freedom to provide maritime transport services between member states <e>", "<cs> my lords we have certainly discussed the airport agreement with the gibraltar authorities we have made clear in negotiating the agreement with spain that it was subject to the gibraltar house of assembly passing the enabling legislation <e> <s> gibraltar has not done so <e> <s> we have made clear to the gibraltar government that the agreement constitutes no concession on sovereignty and have urged them to bring benefit to gibraltar by implementing it <e> <s> we cannot force the agreement on gibraltar <e>", "<cs> my lords the airport agreement is a different matter from the subject of the question on the order paper <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes me to go into detail on the airport agreement i think it would be better to wait for a question to be tabled on that subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his question <e> <s> as i said in my <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> a number of united nations agencies are involved in that field and we play a full part in all of them <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i think my noble friend is right <e> <s> burning has an immediate effect of damage but the more serious effect is the removal of the forests themselves <e> <s> i gave an estimate of the figure involved in my original answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord has a good reason for asking that question but the scale of the problem is somewhat greater than we could deal with on our own <e> <s> it is a worldwide problem <e> <s> if the current deforestation in the world goes on as it is at the moment for the next years or so it is estimated that an area of forest times the size of england and wales will be lost <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not have the opportunity to see the programme to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> however i am obviously aware of the world-wide scale of the problem <e> <s> that is why we as a country are addressing it through bilateral and multilateral agencies <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot say whether we support the charity to which the noble baroness refers <e> <s> we expressed our anxiety about the indigenous people of brazil during the president of brazils visit to the united kingdom <e> <s> we hope that the government will act positively in controlling the illegal activities of goldminers in the amazon <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my original answer my right honourable friend the minister for overseas development met the brazilian environment minister on th may <e> <s> among the matters he raised were our proposals for helping the brazilians with that problem <e> <s> since the memorandum of understanding was signed last july we have been working out project proposals <e> <s> so far we have identified one worth million which has been agreed <e> <s> we are preparing another eight projects covering sustainable forestry management and research into the genetic resources of the forests <e> <s> we hope that most of those will be under way this year <e> <s> so we have not been inactive in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords not at all <e> <s> we have an extremely generous overseas aid programme <e> <s> it amounted to over billion last year <e> <s> it is not the british governments money to which the noble lord refers it is that of the taxpayers <e>", "<cs> my lords the united kingdom supports the international debt strategy which provides financial assistance to debtor countries conditional upon their pursuing economic <e>", "<cs> my lords the proposals of the world bank have received broad support from industrialised countries including ourselves <e> <s> naturally this is an early stage of the proposals and more work is needed to clarify the issues before the scale of the programme can be defined <e> <s> the bank plans to hold a meeting of donor governments in june for further discussions on its proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords broadly i think i can agree with the noble lord which is a change <e> <s> yes obviously that is the purpose behind this proposal from the world bank <e>", "<cs> my lords the latter part of my noble friends question is a matter which we shall be going into in greater detail later this afternoon <e> <s> the figures that i have available show that it is estimated that developing countries currently account for about one-third of the annual greenhouse gas emissions about per cent <e> <s> of fossil fuel emissions and per cent <e> <s> of carbon emissions resulting from deforestation <e>", "<cs> my lords the world banks proposals cover four main environmental issues namely the depletion of the ozone layer the control of cfcs the control of greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity in the international river and marine environment <e> <s> i do not think that debt is part of that process <e> <s> the bergen conference was useful <e> <s> the united kingdom played a constructive part which was recognised by the conference as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have in front of me the quotation to which the noble lord refers

minimised <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot confirm or deny the figure which the noble lord gives <e> <s> as i said we support those organisations and we shall seek to persuade the americans that they

certainly look at the specific point raised by the noble baroness and write to her with my reply <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lords point our provision of million on population growth is for the current year <e> <s> the figure of - million to which i referred was the provision to the specific multilateral agencies <e> <s> in answer to the second point the figures i gave were cash terms compared one with the other <e>", "<cs> my lords harwich does not have a ports police force and therefore those constables would not be allowed to search private residences <e> <s> in any event they would not be allowed to do so unless they put themselves under the relevant section of the police and criminal evidence act <e> <s> if they formed themselves into a police force such as the british transport police or the port of london police they could be covered by the provision but at present that is extremely unlikely <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to my noble friend lord bethell

friend has a case to put it will perhaps be looked at sympathetically <e> <s> the international fund for ireland is a separate subject but on the whole it is thought to be a good thing <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe not but i shall have to ask the noble lord to look at the list which i placed in the library <e> <s> i have not yet been able to produce a detailed analysis of all <e>", "<cs> my lords not under this particular heading <e>", "<cs> no my lords i cannot explain <e> <s> it is not for me to explain <e> <s> it is for the edinburgh actuaries to explain that to the commission to justify their case in advance <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has his name down to speak later in the debate and i shall respond at the end <e> <s> if he wishes to make those points in his speech i shall certainly take them into account <e> <s> in the meantime i have slightly overrun the time allowed to me so i shall conclude <e>", "<cs> my lords i began my speech this afternoon by making clear why i welcomed this debate <e> <s> my hopes for it have not been disappointed <e> <s> we have heard a most distinguished list of speakers many of them with great experience of european matters <e> <s> i noted particularly the interesting maiden speech of the noble lord lord richard <e> <s> i should like to join other noble lords in congratulating him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not have time to read through it right now <e> <s> but for the avoidance of any doubt i can tell noble lords that the speech which i made this afternoon obviously represents government policy <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> we certainly took a lead so far as concerns poland indeed we were the first in the field with the know how fund <e> <s> we started with individual country pledges for example million for poland and million for hungary <e> <s> however now that the programme has been extended to include other <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is certainly right in that it was agreed at the dublin summit that this problem required close examination before we decided on the remedies hence the councils decision to ask the commission to initiate a study involving experts from the international financial institutions <e> <s> as he said this is certainly of great importance <e> <s> however i am not quite sure about its timing <e> <s> i know that the commission has been asked to carry out this task as quickly as possible but i am not sure about the expected date of completion <e> <s> naturally when the recommendations are available we shall look closely at them with a view to participation <e>", "<cs> my lords that my well be the case <e> <s> the soviet union is a potentially rich country which has been subject to over years mismanagement on a monumental scale <e> <s> economic help can make no sense until there is real economic reform to support <e>", "<cs> my lords we are straying a little from the question on the order paper <e> <s> i am not sure whether russia is included in the definition of eastern europe <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a different question but we have supported gorbachev throughout in the reforms that he has tried to make <e>", "<cs> my lords the know how fund is closely monitored <e> <s> i could give your lordships a list of all the projects so far allowed or in the pipeline <e> <s> they are tailored mainly to what countries require and what they believe we are best placed to help them with <e> <s> in respect of the european community the commission is the body responsible for co-ordinating the assistance <e> <s> i am sure that it will closely monitor the effects <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i have dealt with the question of the soviet union <e> <s> i have nothing further to say at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords we have already given an assurance that aid to eastern europe of the type that i have described today is in addition to our existing aid programmes for other parts of the world <e> <s> i am afraid that i cannot answer the noble lords question about where staff in the oda come from or whether they will be returned to those duties subsequently <e>", "<cs> my lords our aid and that of the commission are tied to a number of criteria that there should be free and fair elections in a pluralistic democracy respect for human rights the rule of law the introduction of a market <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i am not in a position to reply to the noble lords quest ion at this moment <e> <s> i have examined the issue in the past but i cannot remember the exact answer <e> <s> i shall write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i am aware that the report of the iwc scientific committee upon which japanese scientists are represented concluded that the take of dalls porpoises was clearly unsustainable and that the catch should be urgently reduced to the level of previous years <e> <s> since then we have received assurances from the japanese that new regulations will reduce the number caught <e>", "<cs> my lords on the noble lords first point about drift net fishing we share the anxieties of environmentalists about large-scale drift net fishing practised by the japanese in the south pacific <e> <s> happily the nations concerned were able to agree last year to a united nations resolution which calls for an end to large-scale drift net fishing in the south pacific by th june and unless scientifically proved unnecessary a global moratorium by th june <e> <s> the united kingdom with its ec partners was able to play a major and constructive role in those discussions <e> <s> on the noble lords point about making representations to the japanese my noble friend lady trumpington saw her japanese counterpart only last week and raised that issue <e> <s> we shall of course raise it during the course of the present conference in the netherlands <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to look into the point about drift net fishing in the north sea to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> however we are in any case in a good position to approach the japanese without embarrassment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> our views on commercial whaling are well known to the japanese and have been reiterated in ministerial discussions most recently in late june <e> <s> our delegation to the present iwc meeting will resist any suggestion that the present moratorium on whaling should be lifted <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure that i can answer my noble friends question <e> <s> we have consistently argued in the iwc and elsewhere that we are not opposed to scientific research whaling <e> <s> however we believe that specific programmes should only be undertaken when they can fully satisfy the iwc scientific committee <e> <s> the japanese programme did not do so <e> <s> equally valid scientific data could be collected by non-lethal means <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly take into account what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i am afraid that i am not in a position to give a specific answer at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall ascertain whether that can be included in the representations that we make this week in the netherlands <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that there is no comparison between the two <e> <s> so far as i am aware the fox is not an endangered species <e>", "<cs> my lords the relationships are not comparable <e> <s> the government have never recognised the legality of the incorporation of the baltic states into the soviet union in <e> <s> successive governments have regarded tibet as autonomous while recognising the special position of the chinese authorities there <e>", "<cs> my lords unfortunately i have not seen the letter to which my noble friend refers but i suppose that is not surprising <e> <s> as i said in my original answer we do not regard the two matters as comparable <e>", "<cs> my lords we have always recognised the dalai lama in his role as a distinguished spiritual leader <e> <s> there is no question of preventing him from coming here he is welcome at any time <e> <s> however he is regarded as a leader of a government in exile which is not recognised by any government and we have no dealings with it <e> <s> meetings with ministers would therefore be open to misinterpretation <e> <s> that policy is quite in line with the policy of our ec and g partners <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not appeasing china at all in our policy as regards tibet <e> <s> we have to take into account our interests in hong kong when dealing with china but that is a quite separate issue <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that tibet was brought under chinese control during the qing dynasty between and <e> <s> that goes back rather further than <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that dialogue between the tibetans and chinese offers the best hope of a solution to the problem <e> <s> we have encouraged the chinese government to engage in a dialogue and we have also raised with the chinese the question of human rights abuses in tibet and throughout china <e>", "<cs> my lords that is up to them <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a different question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of the comments which the noble lord attributes to my right honourable friend the prime minister <e> <s> as i have said we are not appeasing china by our policy <e> <s> we have made representations to the chinese about the human rights abuses in tibet and throughout china <e> <s> my honourable friend who is to visit china shortly will once again make those representations <e>", "<cs> my lords we urge the chinese to behave better as regards their own citizens particularly in the context of the events of last june <e> <s> if that were to happen it would be a good way of restoring confidence in hong kong <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly true that when india obtained its independence in her majestys government relinquished all rights and responsibilities in tibet as set out in the treaties between china and tibet <e> <s> the new government of india assumed those rights and responsibilities <e>", "<cs> my lords having heard the speech of the noble lord in the hong kong debate last friday i think it is unlikely that i would agree with much of what he has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of the problem which the noble lord raised <e> <s> however i shall find out about it and write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall wish to see considerable progress towards democracy and economic freedom before considering long-term economic aid to romania <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for bringing those demands to our attention <e> <s> we regard them as practical examples of the criteria which we have already laid down in concert with our partners <e> <s> those criteria are commitments to the rule of law a multi-party system respect for human rights economic liberalisation and media freedom <e> <s> it must be clear that as things stand in romania not all of those criteria have been met <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of any contributions that we have made through the eib to romania <e> <s> i should be surprised if i found that that was the case <e> <s> we have given humanitarian aid to romania both bilaterally and with our partners in the ec but humanitarian aid is a different matter from economic aid <e>", "<cs> my lords we have not started economic aid to romania as i outlined in my first answer <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend that we need to see those conditions met <e> <s> we are grateful to my noble friend lady cox and others from this country for acting as independent observers at the election in romania <e> <s> despite the election we have since seen some rather unpleasant scenes <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already made clear to the noble lord the leader of the opposition that humanitarian aid is a quite separate issue from long-term economic aid to which the question refers <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that romanias needs are pressing <e> <s> we have given over million so far through the ec and bilaterally and we have no intention of preventing more being given <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that specialist organisations are much better qualified than governments to take the necessary steps to ensure the preservation of the cyprus heritage <e> <s> however we support a number of bodies which could play a useful role in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right when he says that this matter would be more easily and better settled if a comprehensive solution to the cyprus problem could be found <e> <s> our aim is to help to achieve a comprehensive just and lasting settlement in the framework of one state and two communities <e> <s> we regret that the last round of inter-communal talks in new york reached an impasse <e> <s> however the way ahead was mapped out in security council resolution which was adopted <e>", "<cs> my lords no we do not recognise the government of northern cyprus <e> <s> therefore it would not be appropriate for us to enter into direct talks with them <e> <s> i would only urge noble lords and others who have contacts with the government of northern cyprus to use their good offices to help with some solution to the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot say exactly what response my right honourable friend had from either the greek or the turkish foreign minister <e> <s> i should make clear if i have not done so in my original answer that it was not on the specific issue of the cultural heritage of northern cyprus but on the whole cyprus problem <e> <s> we very much hope that talks can go ahead <e> <s> we send the secretary general our best wishes for making progress in that direction <e> <s> we shall do anything to help <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that we can achieve a settlement of the problem for the reasons given by the noble baroness <e> <s> undoubtedly there is a role in that for the council of europe but i understand that as yet unesco is not involved <e> <s> it would be favourable to find a solution to the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot comment on the noble baronesss assertion that british parliamentarians are not concerned <e> <s> that is a matter for them <e> <s> however the fact that the noble baroness has raised the issue at question time today demonstrates concern <e> <s> i am sure that the best way forward is to complete a comprehensive settlement as regards cyprus and then it would be easier for us to have an influence in what happens in the north <e>", "<cs> the administrative decree remains in place <e> <s> while it curtails several basic freedoms which we should like to see restored as soon as possible its introduction must be seen against a rising tide of the kurdish workers party pkk terrorist activity in south east turkey which has been responsible for over deaths so far this year <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to the arguments expressed in support of the amendment but i am afraid that i have not been persuaded by them <e> <s> to us the amendment is unacceptable for two reasons <e>", "<cs> the amendment states by order <e> <s> it does not state that it has to be approved by either or both houses of parliament <e> <s> i believe that that is the very least that would be required <e>", "<cs> i disagree with the noble lord <e> <s> the amendment provides that the home secretary can make an order to increase the numbers without seeking parliaments approval <e>", "<cs> i did not say that the effect of the amendment would be to allow all million british dependent territory citizens in hong kong to come here <e> <s> i merely said that there were those who held the view that was right there were those who held the view that it should be more and there were those who held the view that it should be all the million <e> <s> i believe that that was the policy of the noble lords party <e> <s> i was not trying to say that he would let them all in at one go if the amendment were passed <e>", "<cs> it would certainly go a long way towards answering the first criticism that i made of the amendment <e> <s> but it would not answer the second criticism that the figure appears to us to be the right figure and we simply could not accommodate more than that if the cheque had to be cashed <e>", "<cs> of course i accept that <e> <s> but what i was saying is that others would no doubt argue for a greater number of different groups if they had the opportunity <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord bonham-carter decides what to do with the amendment perhaps i may answer the point of the noble lord lord shepherd <e>", "<cs> one of many interest groups <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly take note of my noble friends suggestion and bring it to the attention of my right honourable friend <e> <s> i shall also draw to the attention of the soviets the concern that is felt in your lordships house this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact that the soviets have admitted to the crime at katyn after so many years is a tribute to the openness of the policies adopted by president gorbachev <e> <s> we all welcome that <e> <s> i am not aware myself of a possible massacre at kharkov though that does not mean that the government are not aware of it <e> <s> i shall certainly look into that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords our record of implementation of measures in the single market programme is along with denmark the best in the community <e>", "<cs> my lords it proves our commitment to europe <e> <s> it also proves that whereas some indulge in a good deal of rhetoric about what good europeans they are we actually get on and implement the measures we have to <e>", "<cs> my lords statistics are not kept centrally by the commission for breaches of directives other than under the single market measures to which i referred in my original answer <e> <s> the noble lord asked about dirty beaches <e> <s> as noble lords will be aware we have a billion programme under <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my recent answer we believe that the list of offending beaches was based on out of date statistics <e> <s> we have a very large programme to improve the quality of our beaches <e> <s> the noble lord said that the directive was accepted years ago <e> <s> certainly not much was done about it in the first five years of those years <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend may well be right <e> <s> i am afraid that i do not have figures regarding the beaches of other countries <e> <s> what we favour is an extension of commission monitoring and reporting on implementation to all fields of european community legislation <e> <s> my right honourable friend has proposed this to m delors and to the president of the european parliament <e> <s> that remains under consideration <e>", "<cs> that may well be the case my lords <e> <s> we believe that our record of implementation is good across the board <e> <s> we take pride in honouring the obligations that we take on in the community <e> <s> it is a fact that along with denmark we have only directives unimplemented of the single market measures which are due to be completed <e> <s> italy is bottom of the table at <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures i have given represent the single market measures implemented in full <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much agree with the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords the commission has already published the figures for the single market measures to which i have referred <e> <s> i am certainly happy to place a copy of the table in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure what the noble lord had in mind <e> <s> it is for my noble friend who asked the question to say whether he was pleased with the answer not the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords in regard to torture turkey is a member of the united nations conventions against torture <e> <s> we look to her to abide by her obligations <e> <s> there are as the noble lord said still worrying reports but the turkish authorities emphasise their determination to crack down on abuses <e> <s> the turkish courts have investigated police and army officers and in several cases found them guilty of mistreating villagers <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not a question for us alone <e> <s> the council of ministers when considering the commissions opinion will take into account all relevant factors including turkeys human rights record <e>", "<cs> my lords we regard this as an important issue <e> <s> turkey has made progress in recent years <e> <s> it is essential that she respects and abides by the terms of international human rights agreements of which she is a signatory <e> <s> my right honourable friend the prime minister most recently discussed this issue with the turkish president during their meeting at gallipoli on th april and my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary with the turkish under-secretary on th june <e> <s> the turkish government have reaffirmed their determination to solve the remaining problems but the ultimate test must be their performance not their statements of intent <e>", "<cs> my lords i said in fact that it was not a question for us alone <e> <s> it is a question for the council of ministers when considering the commissions opinion <e> <s> we shall also take into account turkeys human rights record <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i did not catch the first part of the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords we have received reports of iraqi kurds deported by turkey to iran <e> <s> the united nations high commission for refugees has no reason to believe that they have been ill-treated since they arrived in iran <e> <s> the noble baroness asked about aid to the camps <e> <s> we have contributed substantially to the various projects in hand <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that that is correct <e> <s> the council of europe is looking into these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords the british government are closely involved in efforts to bring about a comprehensive political settlement in cambodia notably through meetings of the five permanent members of the security council <e> <s> the five held their latest meeting in paris on th and th july and made further progress in elaborating the elements of a settlement <e> <s> they have agreed to accelerate their work and to meet again in new york on th and th august <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that recent reports of khmer rouge advances have been

the noble lords question regarding the united nations seat <e> <s> it is clearly extremely welcome news that the americans are proposing to talk to the vietnamese on the cambodian situation <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said we have already made it clear that in the autumn we shall need to review our stand regarding the cambodian seat at the united nations <e> <s> we do not wish the khmer rouge to continue to occupy that seat <e> <s> obviously we would rather that the peace process makes advances and that the supreme national council will be formed in time to occupy that seat <e>", "<cs> my lords the five have agreed on the composition powers and functions of the supreme national council <e> <s> it will be up to the cambodian parties to decide who should be part of the council <e> <s> the important aspect to bear in mind as regards the khmer rouge and pol pot is the fact that the members must be acceptable to each other <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall certainly be discussing this matter with the americans at the earliest opportunity <e> <s> as has been said this news has only recently been released <e> <s> we regard it as welcome news <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we keep closely in touch with senator evans on the matter <e> <s> it was his proposal in the first place that the united nations should play a more significant role in a transitional authority for cambodia <e> <s> that is exactly what the five permanent members have been discussing over the past few months <e>", "<cs> my lords we keep in touch with the thai government and other asean countries which are closely involved in the matter <e> <s> however it is the chinese who have been supplying arms to the khmer rouge <e> <s> they are a member of the permanent five group <e> <s> the fact that they are taking part in the discussions among the five permanent members is an encouraging sign <e>", "<cs> my lords we have asked both the soviet and the polish governments to assist in finding alternative accommodation for our entry clearance operations in moscow and warsaw <e> <s> in the meantime we have taken all possible steps including the use of extra temporary accommodation in moscow and local modifications to our offices to reduce the inconvenience to those applying for british visas <e>", "<cs> my lords we are as i said in my original answer doing as much as we can to improve the situation in moscow <e> <s> applications which are welcome as my noble friend said have risen considerably <e> <s> in visas were granted last year the number was and in the first five months of this

preparation of a bill to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords we were not in a position to take decisions on the clrs lines when the go-ahead was given for the jubilee line <e> <s> it is important to remember that either of the two schemes mentioned in my noble friends question would be very expensive <e> <s> the east-west crossrail is costed at billion at march prices and the

years <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> one is the proposed east-west crossrail <e> <s> that is a proposal for a line from paddington eastwards towards the city <e> <s> the other is an underground line

paper <e>", "<cs> my lords disruption would definitely be caused by the construction of either or both of those lines whenever that happens and it is best that they should not both be built at once

comply with the relevant security council resolutions which provide for unconditional withdrawal from kuwait <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is absolutely right <e> <s> fortunately that is what the united nations decided in many resolutions passed since the illegal invasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with what my noble and learned friend said <e> <s> i cannot answer for the churches <e> <s> as i said in an earlier answer i do not believe it is a view universally held by the church <e> <s> however kuwait must be freed of the iraqi presence <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously sanctions must be allowed time to work <e> <s> nobody has ever said otherwise <e> <s> however your lordships will have an opportunity to debate this matter in full tomorrow afternoon <e> <s> i answered the point raised by the noble lord in his question <e> <s> further debate would be better in the context of a full debate tomorrow <e>", "<cs> my lords although munich was before my time from all that i have read there seems to be a distinct similarity <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad that the house is having this opportunity so early in the new session to debate the subjects of transport and <e>", "<cs> my lords yes and no <e> <s> i appreciate the importance of trade with mexico <e> <s> therefore through the air services agreement the government have set up the mechanism for establishing direct services <e> <s> on the other hand i am not prepared to lean on the judgment of commercial airlines on the question of whether or not they should mount such a service <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> the airlines are perfectly capable of forming their own judgment with a view to what the noble lord lord molloy said <e> <s> it is entirely a matter for them as to whether or not they wish to mount such a service <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think so <e> <s> i understand that british airways has applied for a route licence with a view to resuming services to mexico city in <e> <s> the question of a slot in this country would be considered through the normal mechanism <e> <s> however i am not aware that that would be any problem as regards mounting such a service <e>", "<cs> my lords it has not been refused <e>", "<cs> my lords there is nothing to prevent any airline from applying for a licence <e> <s> provided that the normal requirements for an issue are fulfilled i can see no reason that such an application would be refused <e>", "<cs> my lords that is rather the impression that i have been trying to create in answering this question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> that is certainly true <e> <s> investment over the next three years will be nearly three times the level in real terms that it was under the glc <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his acknowledgement that the situation of the escalators has improved <e> <s> that is a subject of great interest to your lordships as i remember from previous occasions answering such questions <e> <s> the target is for per cent <e> <s> availability by the end of march <e> <s> the latest figures show that per cent <e> <s> of escalators are already in service <e> <s> clearly it will be even better when per cent <e> <s> of the escalators are working full time <e> <s> it is now up to london transport to turn its attention to the lifts <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my original answer a very large amount of money is being invested by london transport at the moment <e> <s> it is not possible to deal with every line at the same <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble lord can have heard my original answer <e> <s> i made it quite clear that record amounts of money are being spent by london transport on the underground <e> <s> plans are also in hand for greater expenditure on the system <e> <s> a very large amount of money is involved <e> <s> the noble lord may remember that during the past years or so the number of people travelling by tube has risen by about per cent <e> <s> that figure was reached after a long period of declining numbers <e>", "<cs> my lords we already have a policy which encourages regional development <e> <s> indeed a good many civil servants have moved or are about to move out of central london <e> <s> however if this country is to prosper and if london is to remain the financial capital of europe it is essential that we continue to invest money in the transport services <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the figures with me at the moment but not so long ago i answered a question on the number of british transport police on the london underground system <e> <s> that number is increasing at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that the investment in london transport is too late <e> <s> as i pointed out a few moments ago investment under this government is three times what it was under the glc <e> <s> i agree that it is better late than never it would probably never have been under the glc <e> <s> the noble lord went on to say that our transport systems in london are not as good as those in some other european capitals <e> <s> i know that he probably has more experience of europe than i have but when i have visited other european capitals i have found congestion almost as bad if not as bad as one finds here in london <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the first part of the noble lords question is no but the investment in lifts and escalators will go on despite that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his question <e> <s> i heard what he said about the increased use of buses <e> <s> that is something which we would wish to encourage and which will be encouraged by the introduction of red routes <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord appears to be arguing for a return of the glc to take care of our transport problems <e> <s> the glc was abolished about five years ago <e> <s> had it been as successful as noble lords opposite would like to make out we would not have the problems we have today nor would my noble friend have needed to ask his question <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may well be right that the misery of the northern line started because the glc did not invest enough money in the transport system <e>", "<cs> my lords it is for industry itself to grasp the opportunities which will be offered by the opening of the channel tunnel <e> <s> the governments role is to facilitate industrys tasks and that is what we are doing <e> <s> the national motorway and trunk road programme is being expanded to provide for the general increase in traffic which is now forecast <e> <s> the programme especially in kent takes full account of anticipated growth in cross-channel traffic much of which will use the tunnel <e> <s> and british rail proposes to invest well over billion in tunnel-related improvements to freight and passenger services <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the tunnel will bring cost savings in carrying goods across the channel due to greater transport competition <e> <s> it will offer for the first time the possibility of reliable delivery times of united kingdom exports to the continent <e> <s> the consequent increased levels of trade with our european partners will contribute to economic growth and employment in the whole of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords british rail proposes to have up to regional freight terminals <e> <s> they are not all yet identified so i cannot confirm whether bristol will be the noble lords nearest one <e> <s> it is estimated that up to per cent <e> <s> of freight transport will emanate from beyond london <e> <s> that should be encouraging <e>", "<cs> maybe my lords but exports are increasing faster than imports and therefore they will be assisted by the opening of the channel tunnel <e> <s> of course it will be a two-way trade so it is at the moment with the use of ships <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the trains will go so far as scotland as soon as the channel tunnel opens <e> <s> i have already said that there will be regional freight depots but the location of those has not yet been finally decided <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness should not have too long to wait <e> <s> i understand that british rail plans to announce the siting of the freight terminals certainly by the early part of next year <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that that is the case <e> <s> as i said there will be substantial freight traffic passing through the tunnel <e> <s> freight trains will travel at speeds of up to mph which is the same speed as trains running in france and germany <e> <s> the noble lord said that we do not have an integrated transport system <e> <s> however no one has ever explained to me exactly what that means indeed it means different things to different people <e> <s> we have a balanced transport system with substantial investment going into both road and rail <e>", "<cs> i hope so my lords <e> <s> we in britain have one of the best if not the best road safety records in europe <e> <s> however we should still like to see it improved <e> <s> our target is for a one-third reduction in casualties by the year <e> <s> that is a tough target <e> <s> we are at the moment particularly anxious about the increase in deaths of and casualties to children <e> <s> we need to concentrate our efforts on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that they are a problem and a hazard both to themselves and to drivers <e> <s> we are especially anxious about drunk-drivers but those wandering around the streets drunk are equally a hazard <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that coaches are driven more dangerously than motor cars <e> <s> however we are in the process of introducing measures on residential areas <e> <s> they include new road hump schemes and new mph limits <e>", "<cs> my lords we are anxious about drinking and driving <e> <s> it is and remains the biggest single cause of road accident fatalities almost one-sixth of the total <e> <s> the announcement in march of my right honourable friend the home secretary confirmed that existing police powers to stop and test are extensive and that they strike the right balance between effective enforcement of the law and the freedom of the individual <e> <s> we shall continue to urge the police to make the fullest possible use of those powers <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that road humps can and do make a considerable contribution <e> <s> that is why we have recently made new regulations for the use of road humps <e> <s> they are much simpler than the old regulations and permit even simpler requirements in new mph zones <e>", "<cs> my lords advertisements should certainly contain nothing that is likely to bring the law into disrepute and they should neither condone nor incite violence or anti-social behaviour <e> <s> that includes speeding <e> <s> they should not show or advocate dangerous behaviour or unsafe practices <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not heard criticism of the size of the mph or mph signs before <e> <s> if people cannot see to read that speed limit sign they should not be on the road <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly do so <e> <s> obviously it is not the intention that the sleeping policemen should interfere with the passage of vehicles of the emergency services <e> <s> the regulations for the laying down of road humps should ensure that that does not happen <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the distances apart at which they can be placed are laid down in regulations <e>", "<cs> yes my lords or indeed any policeman <e> <s> the design of sleeping policemen is specified <e> <s> we have made various changes to the regulations governing their design including flat-topped humps <e>", "<cs> my lords enforcement is a matter for the police <e> <s> i have already mentioned the introduction of mph zones with road humps <e> <s> the object of those is that they will be self-enforcing <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i have found todays debate both stimulating and instructive <e> <s> the interchange of views on these two very different but important areas of transport policy is most welcome <e> <s> i am grateful to those noble lords who have taken the opportunity to raise so many helpful and pertinent points others have raised less helpful points <e>", "<cs> my lords in the case of estuarial crossings or monopoly situations that would be up to the potential concessionaire to consider when coming forward with his proposals <e> <s> if there were a competition among different potential concessionaires for a particular proposal that would be one of the aspects taken into account <e> <s> although not a precise comparison the channel tunnel has a concession period of years <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly intended to enforce british law in this respect <e> <s> during my researches i noticed that my noble friend asked a similar question almost two years ago <e> <s> i then said that we had weighed foreign registered vehicles in the previous year and that we proposed to weigh during that year <e> <s> i hope that the house will be pleased that we have reached the figure of vehicles this year and are looking for a further increase next year <e>", "<cs> my lords we have a derogation from the tonne directive until st january <e> <s> we are continuing to survey and strengthen our bridges where necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords in such a case yes <e> <s> however there are few cases of excess dimensions so that seldom happens <e> <s> the common problem is overloading <e>", "<cs> my lords when i last answered the question asked by my noble friend two years ago i said that per cent <e> <s> of lorries had been found to be overloaded <e> <s> the survey now shows that only per cent <e> <s> are overloaded and therefore there has been an improvement during the past few years <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord clinton-davis for welcoming the order <e> <s> i too welcome the conclusions of the oil pollution preparedness and response conference <e> <s> we shall of course have to study and consult on the convention and naturally we shall ratify it as soon as possible if it is seen as desirable to do so <e> <s> as i said in my opening remarks we have a very good record in ratifying imo conventions <e>"]
