["<cs> my lords i think that everything i had intended to say in this debate has already been said much more effectively by those of your lordships who have already spoken <e> <s> i therefore do not propose to detain your lordships for more than a few minutes <e> <s> i too like my noble friend lord devon-port rang up this morning at an early hour the forestry commission in edinburgh and they gave me exactly the same figures as they gave him which have now been revealed to your lordships <e> <s> i think it is a little disturbing <e> <s> i would not mind if we had bought a lot more timber for a proportionately lower price but to buy a lot more timber for a price which is proportionately even higher is not a good businesslike thing to do <e> <s> it is of course in the long run an unanswerable argument for afforesting a great deal more <e> <s> i think the forestry commission has usually done very well particularly under the chairmanship of the noble lord opposite it has been sensible as well as efficient <e> <s> whatever change may be made in the future i do not think we ought to make much change in the conditions and powers and functions of the forestry commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise for not having put my name on the list of speakers yesterday <e> <s> as your lordships know some of our newspapers published in scotland and which do not have printing offices in london do not get here until the following afternoon <e> <s> it was not until this afternoon rather late this afternoon that i heard for the first time that the local authority in fife where i happen to live have made a gift of to russia for the purpose of financing the olympic games which may bring some joy to the russians but none at all to the unhappy people of afghanistan whom they are now oppressing and depriving of their homes and also of their freedom <e> <s> i would have hoped that the local authority of fife might perhaps have spent this money on the social and economic improvement of their own local population who might have gained a little real benefit from it <e> <s> but my lords the local authority have preferred to make their handsome gift to the most oppressive government the government of soviet russia which our long-suffering world has ever known and i hope that their unfortunate constituents in fife will not forget it <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord that i was not in my place when he began his very interesting speech <e> <s> i am sure that he is aware that the scottish housing association which was begun by the late walter elliot when he was secretary of state for scotland about years ago some two or three years ago completed its th house <e> <s> i cannot tell of course how many houses would have been built by other people if they had not done the job but they are a very useful asset <e> <s> they have played a great part so far in at least mitigating the difficulty of the scottish housing problem <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to speak in this house for the first time i would ask for your lordships patience and as a lowlander from north fife i would also look for the leniency of noble lords from the highlands in case by mistake i now proceed to say anything with which they disagree <e> <s> i am very glad that my noble friend lord massereene and ferrard has introduced this debate today on the highlands and islands <e> <s> although the territorial area concerned is as much as half that of the whole of scotland the problems of the scottish per cent <e> <s> living there are so different from those of the rest of the country that presumably it must always be difficult to do justice to them in any general debate on the scottish economy as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment which the noble lady lady saltoun has just moved and i have put my name to it accordingly <e> <s> before doing so however i should declare an interest since on my own farm in scotland the shooting rights are in hand <e> <s> this amendment seeks to remove altogether the rates on in-hand shootings where no income is received <e> <s> at the same time any shootings whether in hand or let where income is received would continue to be rated in the normal way and would thus be unaffected by the wording of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by congratulating my noble friend lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i would like to join with other noble lords in congratulating the noble lord lord jenkins of putney on introducing this debate <e> <s> given that changes in arts policy have been <e>", "<cs> i apologise my lords <e> <s> if i might just finish the other objectives are to develop quality and standards for the regions and in an age which still produces high levels of unemployment and urban deprivations to bring to all communities the oportunities of leisure and the inspiration of art past and present <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to second my noble friends motion for a humble address in reply to her majestys most gracious speech <e> <s> before so doing i should like to say to my noble friends the leader of the house and the chief whip how grateful i am to them for inviting me to speak <e> <s> and as her majestys hereditary standard bearer for scotland i consider it a particular honour to be asked in that capacity to address your lordships today <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with other noble lords in congratulating the noble viscount lord thurso on introducing this bill today <e> <s> before commenting briefly on one or two points connected with the bill i should declare an interest in some salmon netting rights on the river tay estuary in north fife <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with other noble lords in congratulating the noble lord <e> <s> lord jenkins of putney on introducing this debate today <e> <s> before inquiring how far arrangements for supporting the arts may be in need of review some recent and general achievements to which noble lords have already referred of his department and of my noble friend the minister ought to be noted <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with other noble lords in congratulating my noble friend lord thomas of swynnerton on introducing this debate <e> <s> whatever may be the need to revise the basis of british assistance to which my noble friends unstarred question refers or that of western aid in general a great deal of credit should certainly be given to the donor countries concerned for their persistent resolve and effort over the years to relieve poverty and to improve living standards in developing countries <e> <s> although the present level of official contributions falls short of that recommended by the united nations it is no small achievement that the member countries of the development assistance committee of the oecd are now contributing an annual world total of roughly billion at an average of per cent <e> <s> of their respective gross national products <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate my noble friend lord vinson on an excellent maiden speech in which he illustrated so effectively the importance of manufacturing and reminded us of the ethical purpose of wealth creation <e> <s> as chairman of the development commission and president of the industrial participation association the house has been fortunate to have my noble friends advice today and we hope there will be a great many future contributions from him on a wide variety of subjects <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that encouraging reply but should not a small and limited amount of public money be made more generally available to independent and charitably endowed bodies who in the national interest set out to improve training and standards as outlined <e> <s> and although direct dispensation of medical care is no job for the government conversely would not this type of indirect and limited action if pursued confirm even more the current impressions that the present government possess excellent health and good judgment <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with other noble lords in congratulating the noble lord lord parry on introducing this debate <e> <s> as he was recently chairman of the welsh tourist board the house is particularly fortunate in being able to have the benefit of his advice and experience today <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by congratulating both the right reverend prelate and my noble friend lord sanderson on their excellent speeches <e> <s> although unlike my noble friend lord sanderson the right reverend prelate is not a fellow scotsman nevertheless manchester is much nearer to dundee than it was because for the last two years since air ecosse has operated from dundee airport and provided i have not had a very late night i have been able to see the local aeroplane out of the window on its way to manchester early in the morning <e> <s> the existence of this inter-regional service has already done much to help with local business and employment and i should like to endorse the right reverend prelates remarks on that point <e> <s> on the problem of providing proper lifeline services to the scottish highlands and islands i should equally like to endorse the comments of my noble friend lord sanderson <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the clause of my noble friend <e> <s> it achieves a wider representation of fishing interests on boards than that at present by empowering the secretary of state to appoint an equal number of tenant netsmen and tenant anglers with a combined total less than the aggregate number of upper and lower proprietors <e> <s> but it could be argued that the latter category should not be in the majority <e> <s> yet if that were not so then a system of levies and elections for tenants would probably come to be necessary if their representation is to be exactly equal with that of owners <e> <s> that option might of course be the best and no doubt the matter should be investigated further before your lordships committee comes back to it at report or some further stage <e> <s> as it stands however my noble friends clause achieves wider representation on boards without introducing the complications of levies and elections <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the right reverend prelate and the noble lord lord forres on their excellent speeches <e> <s> in slightly different contexts both speakers referred to the anomalies caused by ec food surpluses <e> <s> i am sure we would all wish to see early reforms connected with those surpluses which could benefit agriculture in australia and in other commonwealth countries as indicated by the noble lord lord forres as well as alleviate food shortages in the third world as suggested by the right reverend prelate <e> <s> although the noble lord lord forres has travelled miles from new south wales where he lives in fact he hails from the braes of angus in scotland <e> <s> it is therefore hardly surprising that like everyone who comes from in and around dundee he should talk the good sense that he does <e>", "<cs> i should like very briefly to add my support to those noble lords who are in favour of phasing our english drift nets as distinct from abolishing them straight away and in favour of compensating the fishermen who have been phased out <e> <s> clearly there is a very strong case for doing that although on second reading my noble friend lord gray said that there was insufficient evidence for going beyond the various restrictive measures affecting drift nets recently announced by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords while clearly this bill is closely connected to the tenants rights etc <e> <s> scotland act there is every good reason for judging it quite apart from that act <e> <s> we may support the right to become a house owner we may consider that the act has worked reasonably well in scotland <e> <s> but before welcoming this bill which seeks to extend further the right to buy in the public sector it should be asked whether any of the measures threaten to undo some existing achievements and equally whether the bill in its present form may threaten to deflect government initiative and energy from other important aspects of the scottish housing problem <e>", "<cs> my lords to begin with there appears to be a strong case against this bill quite apart from the separate issue of the amendment which seeks to deny it a second reading tonight <e> <s> this case is based on some very plausible assumptions about certain unwelcome effects which the proposed edinburgh western relief road might possibly produce <e> <s> there is the allegation of its apparent irrelevance in purpose and in cost given that a city bypass is to be constructed anyway or irrelevance at least until the bypass has been completed in the first place <e> <s> then it can be seen to threaten the lothian road or the usher hall area to which my noble friend lord stodart referred where traffic congestion alleviated in the gorgie-dairy and corstorphine area might simply be transferred <e> <s> equally it is contended that the greater ease of approach afforded by the relief road would encourage an increased number of vehicles and thus an unacceptable daily volume of traffic to the city centre <e>", "<cs> i should like to join with others in congratulating the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe on introducing this unstarred question <e> <s> as the noble lord is a past chairman of the forestry commission we are very fortunate to have his advice on the subject as indeed we are to be addressed by another past chairman the noble lord lord john-mackie <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the remarks of my noble friend lord selkirk and the amendment of the noble lord lord mackie of benshie <e> <s> i believe that in scotland there are about housing associations which have a stock of less than homes and there are with less than houses <e> <s> that is out of housing associations <e> <s> would my noble friend the minister agree that the amendment of the noble lord lord mackie attempts to achieve a balance between extending the right to buy on the one hand and protecting the small rural housing associations on the other <e> <s> no doubt it may be objected that if associations with less than a certain stock of homes are exempted from the legislation as this amendment seeks to effect their tenants would be denied a right to buy and would thus be disadvantaged <e> <s> if so would my noble friend the minister consider the expedient that such tenants be entitled to buy at discounted terms elsewhere in the public sector as my noble friend lord selkirk has already suggested <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the remarks of the noble earl lord perth <e> <s> there are surely two important reasons why the existing draft regarding charitable status should be amended <e> <s> first there is the case in itself already recognised and already the law in england and wales that properties of associations which are charities should be exempt from the right to buy <e> <s> secondly there is the need to prevent the anomaly whereby this is now accepted in england and wales but would not be in scotland except in regard to associations that had existed before october although as my noble friend the minister now says there would be a different and more generous date <e>", "<cs> my lords although the provisions of this bill have had a mixed reception there would of course be general agreement that the nature and balance of incentives given to farmers should always be subject to review from one time to another and thus implicitly it would be accepted that these reviews should occur whenever one set of circumstances gives way to another such as the scarcity of food and supplies which prevailed at the time of the and agriculture acts compared with recent common market food surpluses which form the background to proposed legislation now <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the remarks of the noble lord lord carmichael and the noble lord lord mackie of benshie <e> <s> i believe that the amendment offers necessary protection to small rural housing associations without going against the principle of the bill <e> <s> would not my noble friend the minister agree that such a balance would be particularly evident if tenants of the small housing associations concerned were entitled to buy at discounted terms elsewhere <e> <s> yet why should it be necessary to protect small and rural housing associations at all or conversely if there is no attempt to protect them what effect will that have on various considerations including unit management costs the continuing willingness of local voluntary management committees and related employment opportunities <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the remarks of all noble lords who have addressed themselves to these amendments <e> <s> the amendments relating to this question clearly are not proposed for incorporation within the bill <e> <s> if the case for restricting share ownership of certain categories is accepted then it must be better to write any particular restrictions into the articles of association of the baas successor company rather than write them into the bill <e> <s> but of course the first question is should the articles of association contain any restrictions at all and if so should they be along the lines proposed <e> <s> if we were already to have safeguards elsewhere then the current proposals might be either unnecessary or counter-productive <e>", "<cs> i apologise to your lordships committee for not being present when this amendment began <e> <s> in regard to the provision of airport capacity while the bill contains certain incentives and safeguards there is at present no guarantee that supply will meet demand <e> <s> the intention of this amendment is to provide such a guarantee without conflicting with other important considerations <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to all noble lords for their remarks and particularly to my noble friend lord kinnoull <e> <s> clearly the aspects that have to be addressed in connection with this amendment have many relevant consequences for companies and customers and have many management consequences arising from two owners rather than one <e> <s> there are also the consequences of government intervention if the secretary of state were to have reserve powers <e> <s> if it can be agreed to a greater extent what those consequences really will be or will not be then there could be corresponding progress with the revised wording of any similar amendments <e> <s> in the spirit of optimism that such progress can be made i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should simply like to support this amendment <e> <s> it certainly seems right that compensation should occur as proposed <e> <s> for there to be no compensation may not be wrong as a matter of principle but surely it also puts an unfair burden on airport operators passengers and shareholders <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to all noble lords who have spoken to this amendment <e> <s> certainly there is a question of balance <e> <s> too many restraints on the airport owner could always be counter-productive <e> <s> against that there is the national interest and national aviation policy but of course there is always the need to ensure adequate protection <e> <s> in this case i believe that the risk to national aviation policy is far more significant than any risk that reserve powers might be counter-productive <e> <s> but in view of the assurance which my noble friend the minister has just given i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> does he accept that if the existing arrangements for the derating of scottish amateur sports clubs are not soon improved opportunities for sport and recreation in all scottish communities will suffer a great deal <e> <s> does he further agree that the scottish office and cosla should try to persuade all local authorities to adopt the practice in which fife regional council has recently indicated that it may take a lead of a per cent <e> <s> derating for all sports clubs meeting a certain definition but regardless of whether they are licensed premises <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend the minister for what he has said and for the skilful solution that he has provided to what has been a difficult problem <e> <s> this problem has been how to safeguard the timely provision of airports capacity in a way which at the same time would not be counter-productive <e> <s> on the one hand there was the concern that the various measures and incentives contained in <e>", "<cs> my lords i to should like to support this amendment and the remarks of the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> at committe stage he referred to four different options for transfer of the workforce to a new organisation <e> <s> he demonstrated very convincingly why the best option is to have one company to take over the dockyard undertaking <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have at no stage accepted responsibility for the finances of mounting the thirteenth commonwealth games and do not do so now <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> first i should like to thank the noble lord for his kind remarks <e> <s> but i do not think that i agree with what he says <e> <s> the organisers were aware that political boycotts were one of the risks they had to face <e> <s> the government did everything in their power to prevent the boycott of the games from spreading <e> <s> her majestys government are not responsible for the consequences to third parties of the actions of overseas governments who seek to change the will of her majestys government by boycotting international events <e> <s> the overseas governments concerned are responsible for their own actions <e>", "<cs> my lords had edinburgh been bidding for the olympic games and birmingham for the commonwealth games government policy towards both events would have been the same <e> <s> both the commonwealth games company and the organisers of the birmingham bid understood that funds from central government were not available <e> <s> neither was offered support for an operating deficit or help with capital expenditure <e> <s> a so-called doomsday guarantee was given to birmingham to cover any loss in excess of million caused by the last minute cancellation of the games for reasons beyond the organisers control <e> <s> that was a requirement of the olympic committee to cover the possibility of cancellation <e> <s> a similar guarantee was not required for the commonwealth games <e>", "<cs> my lords the aim of the proposed settlement by the commonwealth games company is as i understand it that all small creditors will be paid p in the pound <e> <s> major creditors are being asked to make substantial donations to help organisers bridge their deficit towards which a charitable donation of million is already available from the japanese philanthropist <e> <s> mr sasakawa who has provided million and mr robert maxwell the company chairman who has given <e> <s> i am sure that your lordships will join me in paying tribute to those who have contributed to the costs of mounting the games including those who donated to the earlier public appeal which raised l million <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments position has been clear from the start <e> <s> no government guarantees or contributions were to be available <e> <s> creditors should therefore address themselves to the games organisers who fully understood the position and who knew that they would have to mount the games within the resources they could raise <e> <s> i am sure that noble lords will share my confidence that the governments policy will be vindicated by events <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is slightly outside the question <e>", "<cs> my lords that is perhaps also outside the question <e>", "<cs> my lords the signs are that satisfactory arrangements are being made between the games company and the creditors <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government had contributed only a little that would still have been inconsistent with the premise and the starting point <e>", "<cs> my lords i have some sympathy with the point of the noble lord about timing <e> <s> however i feel that i can reassure him <e> <s> there are two points to be made first that owing to the need to align the order with the new provisions contained in part iii of the transport act wide consultations were necessary <e> <s> secondly the traffic wardens powers were certainly not forgotten but the house of commons came back later than this house <e> <s> as a result there has in fact been no earlier opportunity to bring the matter to the attention of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble and learned friend the lord advocate i beg to introduce a bill to make new provision with regard to scotland for an extension of time for payment of debts to amend the law relating to certain diligences to make provision in respect of messengers-at-arms and sheriff officers and for connected purposes <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house be now resumed <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the university of birmingham is committed to continue the department of transportation and highway engineering in its present form to when its future will be reviewed taking full account of external advice <e>", "<cs> my lords it is important to have an adequate supply of traffic engineers <e> <s> in that respect my information is that the department of transport is unaware of any present deficiency in numbers <e>

years level <e> <s> that is an increase of per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords the university recognises its responsibility to local and national industry and has taken a number of welcome initiatives <e>

intention <e> <s> the government know that very shortly an information memorandum will be issued and privatisation will be able to take place shortly thereafter <e>", "<cs> my lords that is perhaps another question <e> <s> however in regard to the wpbs i can assure the noble and learned lord that the government have the highest regard for the achieve-ments of this station and there are no plans

payment of a fee to the assessor for the issue of a certificate of value under clause <e> <s> it should be borne in mind that after st april assessors will have no statutory duty to value domestic subjects for rating purposes <e> <s> the preparation and issue of certificates will therefore be an additional task which will probably involve a visit and survey of the property in question <e> <s>

lady birk and to all noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> i am sympathetic to the underlying reason for amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> indeed the clause as drafted provides much of what is required since a recording may he made of a musical work for the purposes of instruction by the teacher or student without infringement subsection b of clause excludes copying by means of a reprographic process but the definition of reprographic process in clause excludes the making of a film or sound recording <e> <s> the person making the film will normally want to incorporate a sound recording in his sound-track and clause does not allow this <e> <s> the answer is not to extend clause to include the copyright in a sound recording or film since this would open the door to educational copying of records and videograms <e> <s> any exception in respect of a copyright in a film or sound recording must be limited to copying in the course of teaching the art of film-making as the noble lord lord lloyd proposes <e>", "<cs> in reply to the first point made by the noble baroness lady birk i understand that clause provides the answer and satisfactorily deals with adaptations <e> <s> the open university is certainly covered and no problem arises <e> <s> indeed as i understand it the secretary of state has the power on application to designate any educational establishment that he sees fit <e>", "<cs> the exception in clause allows inclusion of short excerpts from copyright works without the consent of the copyright owner in collections made for use in educational establishments <e> <s> it is subject to certain well defined limits which are intended to ensure that the basic rights of an author to control the exploitation of his work are not significantly curtailed or endangered <e> <s> in the main it is a re-enactment of similar provisions in the copyright act which have stood the test of time <e>", "<cs> i have some sympathy over the language <e> <s> the noble lord asks why education is used when in some senses it is not all-embracing <e> <s> but we should be in a difficult position if we allowed the whole understanding of education to be as general as is proposed in the amendment <e>", "<cs> like the amendment of the noble lord lord peston which we debated just now this amendment seeks a substantial widening of the exception allowing inclusion of copyright material in anthologies for use in schools and other educational establishments <e> <s> this time the effect would be to remove limits of any kind on the number of short excerpts from the works of a particular author which a publisher could include in educational anthologies or collections <e>", "<cs> this amendment raises similar issues to the last of the amendments moved by the noble lord lord peston which we have discussed before dinner <e> <s> as i have indicated our obligations under the berne copyright convention do not allow any derogation from the principle that authors of dramatic or musical works should have the exclusive right lo authorise public performance of their works <e> <s> so long as audiences for performances in schools and colleges are strictly limited to teachers pupils and persons directly connected with the establishment not necessarily including parents the performance can be said to be in private and to be permitted under berne without the need for authorisation to use copyright material <e>", "<cs> i certainly have some sympathy with the point which the noble lord lord morton of shuna raises <e> <s> i shall take the matter away and look at it without commitment but as i said in my earlier remarks the general context is that we cannot act in a way that opens out too much into the public for fear of contravening the berne convention <e>", "<cs> i take the noble lords point on the distinction between generally and any parent <e> <s> i am prepared to reconsider the matter and see what we can do to help <e>", "<cs> i said to the noble

consultations made by the noble lord and the noble lord lord kilbracken the per cent <e> <s> exception was drawn up following detailed discussions between the departments concerned <e> <s> in particular clause was drawn up in close consultation with the department of education and science <e> <s> it represents a balance between the need for teachers to have access to copyright material and the legitimate rights of copyright owners <e>", "<cs> it is my impression that the discussions that have taken place have been with all the relevant parties <e> <s> however i should certainly wish to confirm that to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord lord kilbracken if i gave the impression that i had already addressed amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> i have indeed already addressed amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> in a bill such as this when one returns to previous amendments that may cause i shall not say a copyright problem a not totally dissociated problem <e> <s> the per cent <e> <s> exception that we have made was originally conceived as allowing per cent <e> <s> per academic term <e> <s> however it soon became clear that this was not practical as academic terms vary considerably both between establishments and in the length of the different terms in any one educational establishment <e> <s> the noble lord lord morton has already agreed with me about the differences between lengths of terms in england and scotland <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> it appears that this amendment seeks to reduce the cost of photocopying licences to schools by providing that copying which falls within the limits set out in clause shall be free <e> <s> in other words royalty payments could only be calculated for copying which goes above those limits <e> <s> i must resist this <e> <s> the purpose of clause is purely to ensure that very small-scale copying can always be carried out in schools <e> <s> the kind of copying that we are talking about is where a teacher makes up compilations of short comparative extracts from books and musical works for teaching purposes <e> <s> we were persuaded that it was desirable on educational grounds to ensure that this kind of copying could not be prevented by the failure of copyright owners to offer appropriate licences <e>", "<cs> if it could be of assistance to the noble lord perhaps i will intervene <e> <s> where there is licensing there will always be a charge <e> <s> it only arises that it is free if there is no licensing arrangement <e> <s> in those circumstances it would be free for the per cent <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene again <e> <s> i would see the logic of the noble lords argument if it were always the position that the school would take the initiative over starting the licensing arrangement <e> <s> but that is not the case <e> <s> it is the copyright owners who take the initiative <e> <s> therefore if the copyright owners take the initiative and have a licensing scheme the schools do not have a choice in the matter <e> <s> they would then be obliged to pay <e> <s> their exemption from payment only ever arises where the copyright owners have riot initiated a licensing scheme and that is where the exemption for up to per cent <e> <s> applies <e>", "<cs> there may be a slight aspect to the point which the noble lord may have overlooked <e> <s> i agree with him entirely that if schools had the choice not to enter into a licensing arrangement it would not make sense for them to do so if they could get something free <e> <s> but that is not the position <e> <s> the position is that if the copyright owners choose to initiate a licensing arrangement the schools do not have a choice in the matter and will then have to pay <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just add to that a comment on what would happen if schools refused to join a scheme <e> <s> subsection provides that there is no free licensing if licences are available whether the schools take them up or not <e>", "<cs> i should like to begin by agreeing with my noble friend lord stockton <e> <s> in view of the discussions that we have had which have tended to centre on the various options of per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> and so on he may well be excused for being somewhat confused <e> <s> at the same time i hope that it was

that we should all welcome the trend in unemployment which is coming down <e> <s> that is now undeniable <e>", "<cs> my lords the most important change which was the introduction in of the count of

company and its employees or shareholders <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to all members of the committee who have contributed to this amendment <e> <s> perhaps i may say first of all in reply to the noble lord lord rochester who referred to analogies with companies what i also said to the noble lord lord wedderburn a moment ago in connection with the previous amendments that these really are misleading <e> <s> i do not think that they get us very far <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord wedderburn and i take the same view on that <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to noble lords for their contributions and to the noble lord lord wedderburn for his explanation of what he has in mind <e> <s> equally i am grateful to my noble friend lord renton who answered the noble lords points far better than i could and put them in context very well <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the points raised by the noble baroness as regards confidentiality <e> <s> however i believe that the amendment would impose undue restriction on union members <e> <s> for instance a member may need to disclose the details of what he has found in a legal action against the union to which it was relevant <e> <s> in such a case the unions perception of the confidentiality of the accounting records would not and should not prevent him from doing so <e> <s> again in the absence of a court action he may wish to bring to the attention of his fellow members or even the public what he had discovered as part of some complaint against his union involving the assertion that union rules or statutory requirements had been breached <e> <s> i do not believe that there is a good reason for seeking to prevent him from so doing <e>", "<cs> if the noble baroness will give way i listened carefully to what she said <e> <s> i had not appreciated one aspect of what she had in mind that it would be for the union to apply to the court and that the amendment would not be triggered unless the court took the initiative to trigger it <e> <s> i am prepared to take this away and have a look at it <e> <s> i believe that it is a constructive approach <e> <s> i will take it away and look at it without commitment <e>", "<cs> i was interested in the sense in which the noble lord lord wedderburn pointed out to us that the ownership of union property can be construed differently from the ownership of branch property <e> <s> he made the point that union and branch accounts could and somtimes are kept separately <e>", "<cs> clause creates as we know a members right in respect of access to his unions accounting records <e> <s> it does not provide for access to the accounting records of any other body <e> <s> limited companies through which trade unions carry on commercial activities assuming they are companies in their own right cannot be trade unions <e> <s> so it is already the case that the provisions of the act and those of clause have no impact on their affairs <e> <s> simply for that reason i would ask my noble friend if she would see fit to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i take the noble baronesss point that even if this is irrelevant perhaps there is sometimes a case for irrelevance if it gives people peace of mind <e> <s> i should perhaps say to the noble baroness that i would at this stage be perfectly happy to take the matter away and without commitment see if i can come back with something which might be to her satisfaction <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble lord lord mccarthy is suspicious and i hope that i may be able to reassure him that he really has

position if we were to accept this particular amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i believe that his amendment would enable a union property to be lawfully applied in a way

indemnities <e> <s> whether the funds are applied in this way pursuant to any agreement arrangement or understanding to which the union is a party is beside the point <e>", "<cs> the reason for this clause is that in its absence there is no incentive to a union member to behave in the right way because he knows that whatever he does it is quite possible that the union will pay his fine <e>", "<cs> i entirely accept that the intention of the noble baroness is to introduce innocuous and moderate measures but i cannot accept this amendment <e> <s> it would be quite wrong to limit the application of a clause depending on whether or not an offence had been committed in the course of an individuals duties <e> <s> an individuals duties whether or not he is an official of a union should simply not include activities which lead to him being found guilty of an offence with the consequent imposition of a penalty <e>", "<cs> in reply to the noble baroness my noble friend lord trefgarne has already said that the bill is about trade unions not companies <e> <s> i think i said when replying to one of the points on a previous amendment that there would be circumstances under which the union would not be prevented from paying the fine of an individual who had fallen foul of the law and a parking fine might well be one such example <e> <s> however a union member might have obtained a parking fine in taking part in secondary picketing or industrial action somewhere in which case it would not apply <e> <s> it would apply in certain circumstances <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but it is the turn of this side to speak <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for her explanation and i accept that a case can certainly be made for preferring workplace ballots to our proposal which is the postal voting system <e> <s> however i would just say that your lordships house held the view when considering the trade union bill that all executive elections should be conducted by fully postal ballot <e> <s> the government agreed that ballot papers being sent out and returned by post constituted by far the best method but were conscious that many unions did not at the time have precise details of their members <e> <s> it would therefore have been both unreasonable and impracticable to have expected them to move in one stage to fully postal balloting <e>", "<cs> the committee may consider that we have reached a suitable moment at which to break in order to return to

over the matter again <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord rochester <e> <s> in reply to the noble lord lord mccarthy i appreciate the need which he draws to our attention for debating and discussing in general whether it is a good idea to have a scrutineer but with respect to the noble lord what we are debating in this amendment is on the assumption that we have a scrutineer whether that scrutineer is the best person to send out ballot papers <e>", "<cs> before replying to the noble lord lord wyatt i wish to say that i am grateful for the intervention from the noble lord lord chapple <e> <s> it is very useful indeed at this stage and in this context to hear from him about the direct experience in his own union <e>", "<cs> the government already provide substantial financial assistance to unions under the ballot refund scheme and have done so since <e> <s> this assistance was offered despite opposition from the tuc and the labour party <e> <s> some unions came close to being expelled because they dared to apply for assistance <e> <s> even now some unions still oppose the scheme <e>", "<cs> clause does not itself specify the qualifications required of an independent scrutineer but as we have already discussed it gives the secretary of state the power to issue a statutory order specifying named scrutineers and/or the qualifications others should meet

concerned <e> <s> power to specify named bodies will ensure that those already active in the field such as the electoral reform society to which the noble lord lord chapple has already referred need not be excluded <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the committee for the contributions on this matter <e> <s> i agree both with the noble lord lord wedderburn and with my noble friend lord renton but out of context <e> <s> i have much sympathy with the proposition that the commissioner should be a man who tries to conciliate with the union and to bring matters to a conclusion as swiftly as possible <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mccarthy suggested that the commission should have a duty to conciliate <e> <s> that is to be distinguished from the suggestion under the previous amendment that the commissioner should have a duty to consult the union <e> <s> perhaps i may say out of context that i have a great deal of sympathy with that as has my noble friend lord renton <e>", "<cs> to respond to the three themes which have been mentioned my noble friend lord renton made the point that we want to ensure that money is in no way wasted over what is proposed <e> <s> the noble lord lord

amendment <e> <s> however i should like for a moment to put the matter into perspective <e>", "<cs> i do not dispute that at all <e> <s> as i said earlier i have great sympathy with the concern of the noble lord about preventing intimidation <e> <s> all i was attempting to do was to give the background which forms the bill now before the committee which gives a slightly different balance than had previously obtained <e>", "<cs> this amendment concerns the operation of the training commission <e> <s> members of the committee will know that this clause fulfils the <e>", "<cs> i was moving to half support the wishes of the noble baroness because we believe that contributions in an advisory capacity are always most useful particularly so when blessed by the almighty <e> <s> i concede the point made by my noble friend lord carr that there will not be parity between employers and others <e>", "<cs> i should not like to say to the noble lord that his pleas or those of other members of the committee fall on deaf ears because our ears are always open <e> <s> i hope that we always respond in a constructive manner to everything that is said <e> <s> nevertheless i confirm that our decision is not to have parity as he has outlined <e>", "<cs> the powers contained in clause a to c allow the secretary of state to clarify the rights of individuals on government schemes in relation to legislation affecting the workplace where a doubt arises <e> <s> sometimes it has been thought necessary to give trainees specific protections where they would not otherwise have them <e> <s> this was done for example in relation to the health and safety at work act where yts trainees have been given the protection of employees <e> <s> the power in clause d would also enable the secretary of state to specify how payments to such individuals are to be treated for example whether or not the payment should be subject to deductions for national insurance contributions <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton for his remarks <e> <s> he said that the clause implies that civil servants do not have contracts of employment <e> <s> that is not the case because the clause itself begins with the words <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord lord dean and i was interested in his remarks <e> <s> he asked about local unofficial disputes <e> <s> i can tell him that the balloting requirement under the bill as under the act applies only to official actions <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to say to the noble lord that his diagnosis is incorrect <e> <s> what we seek to achieve by this proposal is clarity <e> <s> we wish to make sure that there is as little ambiguity as possible in the ballots that are presented and to align the act with clause of the bill for reasons which are now well known or are becoming well known as representing our intentions in the bill <e>", "<cs> i think that i can give the noble lord an assurance that the government have no such plans to issue a code to require the unions to proceed as he outlined <e> <s> indeed in considering whether or not a statutory code of practice would limit a unions rights to communicate lawful information or advice i can also tell the noble lord that any code of practice issued by the secretary of state under the power which clause will provide will have the legal status of any code issued under the provisions of section of the act <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the committee <e> <s> however i cannot comment on the specific cases mentioned by the noble lord lord mccarthy <e> <s> i should like to emphasise to him that there is nothing in the bill which prevents the unions from giving legal advice in a lawful way <e>", "<cs> in speaking to the noble lords amendments i think we might agree that it is clearly wrong for a trade union to induce members to whom it has not given a vote in a ballot to take industrial action <e> <s> where a ballot is held it is particularly important to ensure that it covers those who are likely to be induced <e> <s> the fact that some acts of inducement may be ineffective does not affect this principle <e> <s> that is why we believe that both a union member and where a tort has been committed an employer or his customers and suppliers should have a right of action against a union in certain circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for the welcome she gives to this measure and for her comments <e> <s> she made the point that in a month and in a year when we have seen such a successful budget we should perhaps be awarding greater funds under the regulations to those disabled in the manner which has been described <e> <s> many applicants under the act have had only one <e>", "<cs> my lords the government appreciate the concern underlying this amendment <e> <s> i am very grateful to noble lords who have spoken to it <e> <s> the green paper recognised in chapter paragraph that properly supervised and organised a fully postal system of balloting is the least susceptible to manipulation <e> <s> i believe that this very much accords with the remarks of my noble friend lord carr of hadley <e> <s> indeed some unions use postal balloting methods as we know for ballots on industrial action and are required by their own rules to do so before they can authorise or endorse industrial action or particular kinds of industrial action <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are always prepared to look at anything that is said at any stage of committee or report in your lordships house <e> <s> but as i said we have looked into this very thoroughly and do not believe that it would be prudent to embark on the course which has been suggested to us by the noble lord at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords the government believe that if a union is contemplating authorising or endorsing industrial action it should ask the members entitled to vote in the ballot to support or oppose the particular variety that is strike or nonstrike of industrial action concerned or pose questions in respect of both types if both are contemplated <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lady lane-fox has just pointed out i agreed to give further consideration to the points made in our previous debate on the subject <e> <s> i have done so and have concluded that the amendment should not be accepted <e> <s> as i said in the committee debate clause creates a members right in respect of access to the accounting records of his union <e> <s> it does not provide for access to the accounting records of any other body <e> <s> limited companies through which trade unions carry on commercial activities cannot be trade unions <e> <s> so it is already the case that the provisions of the act and those of clause have no impact on their affairs <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i take the noble baronesss point <e> <s> we are frequently accustomed to seeing repetition in various acts <e> <s> in this case the point is made in other legislation and probably my remarks should be seen in the context of what we are talking about <e> <s> it is in this context that there would be a risk that if we repeated ourselves the courts would be suspicious and look for a further meaning <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment seeks to make various changes to the scope and terms of clause <e> <s> if accepted it would undermine the intended effect of the clause which is to establish a union members right to inspect his unions accounting records <e>", "<cs> my lords on the question of branches if it were argued that the words in the amendment are better than those in section of the act because they do not specifically refer to the possibility that accounting records might be kept by branches or sections of a union that would be misguided <e> <s> in fact there is no advantage at all as regards the intended effect of clause <e> <s> if any of a unions proper accounting records are kept by sections or branches of that union a member needs to be sure that he has the right to inspect them <e> <s> clause will not of course give a member any kind of right to inspect any other kinds of accounting records for example the records of what has gone on in a particular section or branch which form no part of the proper accounting records of the members union <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baronesses lady turner and lady seear <e> <s> i recognise that some of your lordships wish us to relax the election requirement if not remove it altogether <e> <s> i shall not weary your lordships by repeating why we believe the election requirement is important <e> <s> however that belief means that we have to look very carefully at any relaxation suggested to us <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord mottistone for setting out his views so clearly and for letting my noble friend lord trefgarne and myself have a little advance warning of his amendment <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble lord lord rochester for setting out the reasons behind his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will be patient for a moment i will come to what i take to be the thrust of his remarks <e> <s> as i said we were committed to this by the manifesto at the last election <e> <s> the proposal was also spelt out in the green paper and is popular with union members <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for making that plain <e> <s> i trust that your lordships will not think that because of this we are pushing ahead regardless of what people say to us <e> <s> my noble friend lord trefgarne undertook to consider the wording of new subsection ab again <e> <s> we believe that we have now found a better formulation which makes clear as we have discussed that individuals other than members of the pec general secretaries and presidents will be exempt from the election requirement if their purpose in attending executive meetings is to provide factual information or technical or professional advice with respect to matters taken into account by the committee in carrying out its functions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am interested in the noble lords ingenious suggestion <e> <s> i cannot now give a direct answer because i must take the matter away and think about it <e> <s> i should find the suggestion difficult if the basis of what he has said was as follows <e> <s> if someone has a function which is a could a become b and would the objections which have already been put forward as regards b be disapplied <e> <s> i must say that as soon as a changes to b he becomes b in the full sense and that if we applied any objections to b they would still obtain <e>", "<cs> my lords that would depend on the definition of his duties <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house there are limits to the scope for manoeuvring with titles allowed by clause <e> <s> subsection bb refers to the general secretary or to the position in the union which is the nearest equivalent to that of general secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships may consider that this is a convenient moment to break in order to return to the subject at eight oclock <e> <s> therefore i beg to move that consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to respond to a couple of points raised by the noble lords lord wyatt of weeford and lord rochester <e> <s> first they asked me how it is that the scrutineer is paid and the noble lord lord mccarthy reminded the house that such a scrutineer is paid by the unions <e> <s> indeed as many noble lords will be aware some unions already voluntarily pay for scrutineers when they choose to appoint them <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendments if accepted would deprive a union member of the ability to apply to the court to complain that his union was inducing or was likely to induce him and others to take industrial action without holding a ballot which satisfied the requirements in what will be the new sections a and b of the act <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of the commissioner is to provide assistance without which union members might be unable to take certain proceedings against their union its officials or trustees <e> <s> this redresses the disadvantage they might otherwise face against the superior resources and facilities available to the union <e>", "<cs> no my lords i said that a union member could seek advice from various sources <e> <s> he could use the legal aid green form scheme to help prepare his case <e> <s> indeed his union might well provide even more assistance <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the concern underlying the proposals put forward by the noble lord lord wyatt of weeford but the arguments which i used a moment ago against a self-starting commissioner for the rights of trade union members are also applicable to the proposed extension of the powers of the certification officer <e>", "<cs> my lords section of the act has no relevance in the context of the provisions covered by clause <e> <s> section is applicable only where a union has a trade dispute defence <e> <s> it will be no defence to applications under clauses or of the bill or section of the act for the union to claim that it acted in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house no <e> <s> it is only in the context of postal ballots and not workplace ballots <e> <s> i fully appreciate that the noble lord lord mccarthy may not have <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships may consider that we have reached a suitable moment to break in order to return to the subject in an hours time at <e> <s> if so i beg to move that the further proceedings after third reading be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords assuming that your lordships will agree with me this will be a good time to break in order to return to business in an hours <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> like him i shall speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> if i understand it right amendment no <e> <s> is intended to establish which staff of the ssha and of the housing corporation in scotland are to receive offers of employment by scottish homes <e> <s> the intention is that all those employed by both bodies immediately before a date set by the secretary of state should receive an offer of employment <e> <s> under the terms of paragraph of the schedule that offer shall be on terms which taken as a whole are no less favourable to the person than the terms on which he or she is employed on the date of the offer <e>", "<cs> i can reassure my noble friend that that is a different point in a different context <e> <s> the reference to the secretary of state in this context is simply so that if there should be any doubt whether somebody is an employee of scottish homes the matter can be referred to the secretary of state <e> <s> it is then up to him to decide one way or the other <e>", "<cs> if i am wrong and if the point to which my noble friend refers is ambiguous i shall certainly have it looked into and come back to him at report stage <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> he asks who will ask the questions <e> <s> i can assure him that it is our intention that all existing employees of the ssha and the housing corporation in scotland will be offered a job by scottish homes <e> <s> therefore we hope that there will be no need for any questions to be asked <e>", "<cs> amendments nos <e> <s> and seek to make scottish homes subject to the terms of the public bodies admission to meetings act and to the local government access to information act <e> <s> the main thrust of both these statutes is to allow public access to meetings of certain bodies <e> <s> until it was amended by the act the public bodies admission to meetings act in general terms applied only to meetings of committees of local authorities and health boards <e> <s> since it has applied only to health hoards and its provisions have in the main been superseded by the act <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i appreciate the point he is making <e> <s> if he is happy to do so perhaps it would be best to wait until a later stage of the bill and tie the two matters together at that moment <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the committee i should like to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i have listened very carefully to my noble friends exposition of these amendments <e> <s> they touch on matters of importance <e> <s> however while i believe there is much in what my noble friend says i do not consider that the amendments are necessary <e>", "<cs> i note what my noble friend says <e> <s> i hope i can reassure him when i remind him that in cases of short assured tenancies the landlord is always in a position to regain possession owing to the finite nature of short assured tenancies <e>", "<cs> i have listened to my noble friends case for this amendment <e> <s> however as my honourable friend the scottish office minister for home affairs and the environment explained in another place we are satisfied that any doubts about whether cohabitees will be covered are entirely unfounded <e> <s> the provision in the bill applies to <e>", "<cs> i am again grateful not only to my noble friend lord selkirk but to the noble earl lord perth and the noble lady lady saltoun <e> <s> as my noble friend requests i shall take this matter away and have it looked at again <e> <s> i apologise for assuming that the noble earl had in mind what was discussed in another place when similar words were used <e> <s> i give that reassurance to my noble friend and i shall see whether in the interests of clarity we can do a bit better <e>", "<cs> i listened carefully to what the noble lord said about setting the lower limit for short assured tenancies at months <e> <s> however i am not convinced <e> <s> we must bear in mind that the aim of the short assured tenancy is to give people the chance to let their house for a precise period with an absolute guarantee of regaining possession at the end of that period <e> <s> i accept that that consideration could be consistent with any period one might think of but any minimum period inevitably will be somewhat arbitrary <e> <s> some people will want to let their houses for less than months for example when on an extended holiday or when working abroad <e> <s> that is why we have settled on six months as the minimum period <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will accept this explanation and feel able to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> amendments nos <e> <s> and appear to alter the residence requirement for someone other than a spouse to succeed to a tenancy <e> <s> the government are convinced that the six months qualification in the existing legislation is too short <e> <s> it allows someone with very little real link with a house to take over the tenancy of it <e> <s> as the committee may be aware when the bill was introduced in another place it proposed that the residence requirement should be five years <e> <s> the noble lord lord carmichael has alluded to that <e> <s> however having listened to strong representations from honourable members in another place my honourable friend the scottish office minister for home affairs and the environment agreed to reduce that period to two years <e> <s> i am satisfied that we now have it about right <e> <s> two years is long enough to ensure that anyone succeeding to a regulated tenancy has developed real links with the house concerned but does not impose an unreasonable requirement <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for his question <e> <s> indeed as he has mentioned in some parts of scotland particularly in lanarkshire local authorities do not hold houses as outright owners but on long leasehold tenure <e> <s> for tenants choice to operate in such cases would require an assignation or partial assignation of the landlords <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> he is right in saying that we must do everything we can for rural areas and isolated communities <e> <s> however i believe that the amendment which he has brought to our attention so far as it relates to all houses covered by clause would confuse the statutory position and make its interpretation extremely difficult <e> <s> that is so because subsection c refers to houses in an area which the secretary of state has already designated as a rural area <e> <s> i am not sure whether the noble lord lord carmichael intended to include subsection c <e> <s> it may be that he was seeking to ensure that the same houses are not counted twice if a local authority seeks to have the secretary of state designate as a rural area an area including as a part an area already designated <e> <s> i think i see the noble lord nodding his head <e> <s> if so however there is nothing in the bill as at present drafted which would prevent the local authority applying to the secretary of state to designate as a rural area only the additional parts of the area the local authority has in mind <e> <s> in the circumstances i believe that in its present form the amendment is confusing and that it makes an unnecessary reference to subsection c <e>", "<cs> it may be helpful to the noble lord lord hylton if i were to tell him that we have included as approved persons the housing associations the building society landlords and the co-operatives formed by tenants associations and by tenants themselves and also responsible private landlords <e> <s> there are no categories as such <e> <s> and unlike england there will be no housing action trusts in scotland <e> <s> i hope that will be of assistance to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> in no way is it to be inferred that such trusts are not necessary <e> <s> but we have a different system in scotland of achieving the same effect <e>", "<cs> scottish homes the establishment of which is not paralleled in the english bill should be able to achieve all that housing action trusts will do on the basis of voluntary co-operation <e> <s> i believe that local authorities in scotland would not welcome housing action trusts <e>", "<cs> although i understand the arguments which the noble lord lord carmichael has deployed i believe that they may stem from a misunderstanding <e> <s> in the right-to-buy scheme the result of the transaction is that the house becomes owner-occupied rather than tenanted <e> <s> the price at which this transfer takes place is basically market value with vacant possession less a discount reflecting <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> seeks to remove from the factors to be taken into account by the district valuer when he determines the value of a property for transfer under the provisions of part iii the assumption that only persons approved as receiving landlords will be prospective purchasers <e> <s> clause of the bill however rightly ensures that only suitable persons or bodies that is scottish homes itself or persons approved by scottish homes can acquire property from the public sector under the tenants choice arrangements <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the concern expressed by the noble lord lord grimond as regards monopolies <e> <s> it must be admitted that there will be monopolies in respect of scottish homes but i do not believe that it is one which will give us cause for concern <e> <s> as i said earlier district valuers are highly expert in their job and can easily envisage a bidding situation <e> <s> i believe that if we were to go along the lines suggested by the noble lord lord carmichael in his amendment we should be applying double standards <e> <s> on the one hand we shall <e>", "<cs> i think the valuation criteria set forth in subsection give rise to more complicated problems than the government have yet acknowledged <e> <s> for instance we have this problem of what happens if the sum realised is less than the loan outstanding <e> <s> we are told that this will have to be made good by housing support grant but do we really want a kind of open limitless tap in this direction <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to what the noble lord lord carmichael has said in support of his amendment which seeks to remove from the factors to be taken into account by the district valuer when determining the value of a property the assumption that a prospective landlord will put in hand within a reasonable period works necessary to bring the property in question up to standard <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend and i will certainly consider the point he has raised and whether we can do as he suggests <e> <s> however we believe that the assumption will be fulfilled and that repairs which need to be carried out will be carried out <e> <s> applicants will be reputable approved bodies which will be unlikely to dishonour the terms of any deal struck on repairs in the course of consulting tenants <e> <s> scottish homes will monitor landlords standard of performance for maintenance and repairs <e> <s> in a sense i take the point of the noble lord lord mackie of benshie but the need to put right deterioration and repairs is as it is <e> <s> it is something which is either attended to or not attended to <e> <s> if it is attended to in the right way it must involve costs and hence the influence for the district valuer <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord hylton <e> <s> i shall certainly look into the matter which he has drawn to my attention <e> <s> i cannot answer him now <e> <s> i shall either write to him or bring back something later on <e>", "<cs> clause is designed to prevent possible abuses of the right to acquire by ensuring that it is not possible to circumvent the provision that all transfers under tenants choice should be to landlords approved by scottish homes or to scottish homes itself <e> <s> by requiring scottish homes to approve the first disposal by a receiving landlord of property transferred under the tenants choice provisions possible collusion however unlikely between an approved landlord and a second landlord who might not have attracted the approval of scottish homes will be prevented <e> <s> the clause therefore will operate to the benefit of the transferring tenant <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords we have always made clear that if refinements were made to the community charge proposals for england and wales we should consider whether any parallel changes need to be made to the abolition of domestic rates etc

provisions which are already in the bill for england and wales or are otherwise of a minor or technical nature <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> of course i am aware of the problems to which he alludes and as the noble lord himself will know we intend to bring forward the harmonisation of business rates between england wales and scotland after <e> <s> i point out to the noble lord that as from april the effect of the abolition of domestic rates etc <e> <s> scotland act is to give non-domestic ratepayers in scotland the benefit of indexation of their rates <e> <s> this benefit which comes a year before the changes in england will give the non-domestic ratepayers a degree of protection which they have previously lacked and a degree of certainty as to the likely level of their obligations <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the point which the noble lord makes <e> <s> the scottish amendments will be commenced by order thereby enabling the timing of their introduction to be a subject for consultation and to allow flexibility in the work which goes on in that regard on the ground <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> it is to be hoped that the differences between north and south of the border will come to an end much sooner than that <e> <s> however my right honourable friend the secretary of state obviously cannot give an assurance at present as to exactly when we shall have precise harmonisation north and south of the border <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be so but i think that all our flagship bills this session have very powerful sails and perhaps one or two have outboard engines <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his explanation but i think that this amendment would considerably extend the types of works for which local authorities direct labour organisations could submit tenders <e> <s> it would expand the direct labour organisations potential workload far beyond what they were originally established to do to a quite unreasonable extent <e> <s> as a result i cannot accept the proposal <e>", "<cs> in a sense i take the noble lords point <e> <s> if anybody tendering for a job of work is able to be cheaper than somebody else if we believe in competition and if we want the job of work to be done as efficiently as possible we cannot rule that out <e> <s> nevertheless i must refer him to the remit of local

interesting debate <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs for taking this bill from another place and for the clarity with which she has introduced it here today <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make a distinction in relation to that matter <e> <s> first there is the question of trade secrets which is tackled in a separate clause of the bill <e> <s> secondly

the latter case the process of appeal has been available since as the noble lord will be aware so that is nothing new <e> <s> the bill corresponds to that legislation and reminds us of it <e>", "<cs>

have the advantage of greater simplicity and lesser costs for the tenant than going to the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords in general terms i can only agree with what the noble lord lord grimond said <e> <s> the courts are under great pressure and in many cases tribunals perform a useful function in speeding up matters <e> <s> however for the reasons which i have given it is more appropriate in this case to leave the remit of the sheriffs court as it is rather than to attempt to replace it with a tribunal <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> the question of cost is very important <e> <s> if we had evidence that the cost of having recourse to a sheriffs court was significantly greater and proved to be a disincentive to ensuring that the remedy was effective that would be a matter for our attention <e> <s> however there is no reason why costs should be high before the sheriff <e> <s> costs are very high before many tribunals <e> <s> in order to have grounds for

the other place wished to have time to discuss matters first <e> <s> the noble lord lord morton of shuna asked why if schedule is not intended to come into effect the provision is necessary <e> <s>

swelling or discomfort persists i believe that the best thing to do is to see a doctor <e> <s> my noble friend is quite right however the herbal remedy to which she referred is known to be most

connection at all with the duke of marlborough whose title is also blandford and thus so far as i know it was not used to any extent in the battle of blenheim <e>", "<cs> no my lords the fewer the better <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> i shall pass on her suggestion to my right honourable friend the minister of agriculture fisheries and food <e>", "<cs> at first sight the amendment appears to be sensible <e> <s> surely a board member should submit his or her resignation to the clerk of the board and not to the education authority <e> <s> however members of the committee will be glad to hear that in this case we have not drafted lightly <e> <s> we gave consideration to the fact that the clerk of the board may not always be available to receive the resignation and that for one reason or another the post of clerk may be vacant <e>", "<cs> what the noble lord says would obtain in many cases <e> <s> however he will probably agree with me that with the drafting as we have it and with the option that he has given if matters should not work out neatly in the manner he describes the situation is properly accounted for <e>", "<cs> yes that is the case <e>", "<cs> of course we all expect school boards to be serious bodies doing an important job <e> <s> but we do not expect them to be unduly formal in their approach nor do we expect them to adopt an adversarial style very often <e> <s> in fact i doubt whether many of the decisions will be taken by vote <e> <s> i imagine that the amendment at which we are looking is gleaned from paragraph of schedule to the local government scotland act <e> <s> those are provisions which are all very well and sound in the context of local government where the legislation envisages and provides for political decision-making with issues being regularly decided by votes <e> <s> they are much less appropriate for the procedures of bodies such as school boards which are intended to be small local bodies operating for the majority of their business without contention and the need for votes <e> <s> where there are votes on an issue the simple and well-understood principle of the casting vote will apply <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but i largely take his point <e> <s> however the purport of my earlier remarks was to say to him that with the standing orders this can be done anyway <e> <s> in other words lots can be used instead of the chairman having a casting vote <e> <s> we shall make that point most forcefully in the guidance that will be given to the boards <e> <s> the line we are taking is that it is not a good idea to force boards on the issue <e> <s> nevertheless i take the noble lords point that there is the element of embarrassment <e> <s> we are talking about a small difference here whether we proceed along one line or the other <e> <s> however i am prepared to look again at the matter but without commitment <e>", "<cs> the bill already allows education authorities to request sight of board minutes at any reasonable time <e> <s> i certainly have no fundamental objection to that part of the amendment which would require boards to send copies of all their minutes to their authorities if the authorities so required <e> <s> however i am not so sure that the authorities would be pleased with the effects of this provision in the longer term <e> <s> i expect that much of the boards business will be of little direct interest to their authorities <e> <s> the authorities will have a right of attendance and speech at board meetings through the director of education <e> <s> however why compound all this by insisting on the regular flow of minutes from the board to the authority <e> <s> there is enough wasted paper travelling pointlessly about the country as it is <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for the point he makes <e> <s> if he will bide with us we shall come later to an amendment which addresses the type of remuneration for the secretary and the clerk <e>", "<cs> the governments purpose is to provide flexibility and choice for boards <e> <s> the bill would not prevent a board from choosing to appoint an authority employee as its clerk if that was what it wanted <e> <s> the noble lords amendment would negate that choice <e> <s> it would also give the authority the right to veto a boards appointments <e> <s> are we on the one hand to give boards real responsibility for the management of schools and on the other not trust them with the responsibility of appointing the clerk <e>", "<cs> i take the noble lords point but i shall not comment further <e>", "<cs> what we have provided in the bill is for boards to take account in the exercise of their functions of further education use of shared facilities <e> <s> we have established that boards have to consult where appropriate the education authority the college council and the person in charge of the further education institution <e> <s> this is the mechanism that will ensure co-ordination of use and also coexistence which is mutually beneficial <e>", "<cs> i believe that i can give the noble lord the answer he seeks <e> <s> the references are to be found in clause <e>", "<cs> members of the committee may feel that we have reached a suitable moment to adjourn <e> <s> we shall return to business in one hours time at pm <e>", "<cs> one of the essential considerations in drafting this bill was to ensure that school boards had adequate access to information <e> <s> initially theirs will be a learning process one that will need to be serviced with sufficient information on all aspects of school and education authority practice <e> <s> throughout the bill therefore we have built-in provisions whereby boards can make representations where appropriate to the education authority and to the head teacher <e> <s> for example clause provides that boards may make representations to the head teacher about the schools arrangements for consultation between parents and teachers parents meetings and the like <e> <s> clause enables a board to make representations to its education authority about financial statements that the education authority is to make to boards <e>", "<cs> i understand the intention behind this amendment <e> <s> the amendment would require a board to remit to its education authority any money it raised by charging for the use of school premises outwith school hours <e> <s> however the amendment is unnecessary because a boards control over the use of premises outwith school hours including the fixing of fees and charges is subject to directions by the authority <e> <s> it would therefore be entirely open to an authority to direct its school boards to remit such moneys to the authority <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> the boards could do that within reason <e>", "<cs> during debate in committee in another place there was general agreement that the current arrangement where the education authority alone decides the fixing of occasional holidays was unsatisfactory <e> <s> what emerged quite clearly from the debate was that the fixing of occasional holidays was a particularly good example of the benefits which could be gained from local involvement in decisions which have a local effect <e> <s> school boards will provide precisely that local input and we are convinced that boards will show themselves to be considerably more responsive to local wishes than the regional bureaucracies have been <e>", "<cs> the position will be that while boards will have the ability to choose occasional holidays they will not be able to increase the total <e> <s> it is just that they will be able to decide for themselves on a local basis when they would prefer to hold their holidays <e> <s> in my own case i was hoping that my childrens tattie holiday would coincide with the few days when parliament is prorogued <e> <s> unfortunately there is no chance of that <e>", "<cs> i stand corrected <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may reassure my noble friend lady carnegy that there would be no risk of that <e> <s> there will be only the occasional holiday <e> <s> the only instance where the holiday might be for more than one day would arise if the education authority needed to carry out in-service training <e> <s> it might need to use a school for several days for that purpose <e>", "<cs> i agree with my noble friend lady carnegy that cosla is being a little overanxious <e> <s> i understand the balance of intention behind the amendment of the noble lord lord carmichael <e> <s> while he makes the point that he is not against the principle of delegation his amendment suggests that boards should have a running-in period before seeking delegated powers <e> <s> that is essentially what he is after <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords we are looking at a wide range of options on how best to ensure a continuing supply of nuclear power <e> <s> the government believe that there should be a significant nuclear component within the privatised electricity supply industry <e>", "<cs> my lords a range of options is certainly being considered to ensure that the new company will have an incentive to seek value for money in its nuclear capacity <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friends remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot accept that the government have not had a policy for controlling toxic wastes which may arise from nuclear power installations <e> <s> as regards the future and privatisation every continuing consideration will be given to make sure that this matter is tackled in the right way <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i agree with the noble viscount <e>", "<cs> my lords not without notice <e>", "<cs> my lords too great a reliance on fossil fuels would expose us to interruptions in supply and future price shocks <e> <s> there is a vital strategic need for a non-fossil fuel contribution which can be made for the foreseeable future only by nuclear power <e>", "<cs> my lords in that very unlikely event the costs will be met in exactly the same way as they are now <e> <s> the new company will be covered by the same nuclear insurance provisions as the cegb currently enjoys <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the answer to that question <e> <s> however as i have already indicated the relevance of continuing with nuclear power is not entirely economic <e> <s> there are strategic considerations of having diversified fuels <e> <s> apart from that point it is not necessarily the case at all that nuclear power is uneconomic <e>", "<cs> my lords the industrys safety record is second to none <e> <s> there will be no question of privatisation resulting in a reduction in safety standards <e> <s> as regards the relevance of encouraging non-fossil fuels other than nuclear the matter is continually being given active consideration and pursuit <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> there will be no restrictions on the possibility of importing nuclear power from abroad <e>", "<cs> my lords privatisation will not affect the basic responsibility of nuclear power station operators to undertake appropriate decommissioning operations within the guidelines on safety and environmental protection set by the regulators <e> <s> the government are looking at all options to ensure that the nuclear industry thrives after privatisation <e>", "<cs> my lords all things are possible and i believe we can agree that technology in the field is becoming better <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i think that is a little wide of the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration on report be adjourned until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his concern in this matter <e> <s> however i think we should be quite clear about exactly what it is that is under discussion <e> <s> school boards could have two sources of funds <e> <s> first there are the sums provided to boards by their authorities for running their affairs and discharging their delegated functions <e> <s> those sums are governed by clause <e> <s> any such moneys will remain within authorities financial control mechanisms and will be subject to authority audit procedures in the normal way <e>", "<cs> certainly <e> <s> as regards limits on gifts i can say that there are none <e> <s> a substantial gift could be made but boards will always have to consider a heads advice on how they spend a gift <e> <s> in addressing the concerns of the noble lord lord carmichael again it might be helpful if i remind him that boards have a duty to abide by correct procedures for accounting and accounting management <e> <s> if they were to do otherwise they would be in direct breach of that duty as referred to in the bill <e>", "<cs> the noble lord will recall that at a previous stage of the committee my noble friend lord sanderson of bowden undertook to look at clause and consider putting boards under a duty to report to parents at least once a year <e> <s> with that undertaking to look at the matter i think we have gone some way to meet his concern <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i take his point that if gifts were to be substantial if we were to fall foul of a time factor that is to say that the malpractice had already occurred before parents heard of it and if boards were not to heed whatsoever the advice which had been given to them on correct accounting procedures there would be an unsatisfactory situation <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the intention of the amendment <e> <s> however i believe that we need to distinguish between the kinds of body for which allowances of different kinds are appropriate <e> <s> clearly board members may be involved in some activities training for example which will require <e>", "<cs> i believe it is appropriate to consider whether membership of a school board is service which should be recognised for special leave from employment <e> <s> the government hope that employers will take an enlightened view of that possibility <e> <s> not only is it a valuable local service but there will be many employees who will learn much and develop many useful skills as a result of their participation in the work of boards <e>", "<cs> i believe that this amendment has two aspects <e> <s> first it suggests that the appointment committee should make appointments directly <e> <s> if i may say so this is a little misconceived <e> <s> schedule has been drafted specifically to reserve the right and power of appointment to the authority itself <e> <s> this emphasises that appointment rather than selection is a matter for the authority alone and preserves the authoritys rights as an employer <e>", "<cs> i can understand the noble lords concern in this respect but the effect of this group of amendments if adopted would be to produce a recipe for democracy run riot <e> <s> they appear to require that a ballot of all parents is held before a board takes on any additional functions no matter how small <e>", "<cs> my lords three companies are currently undertaking trials of this product in the uk authorised through animal test certificates granted under the medicines act to determine efficacy of the product in field conditions <e> <s> before test certificates were granted the licensing authority was fully satisfied with regard to the safety to the treated animal and to the consumers of produce from the treated animals <e> <s> had there been any doubts about safety the certificates would not have been granted and the trials could not have begun <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lords first supplementary question section of the medicines act prohibits the disclosure of information supplied by applicants for product licences and test certificates <e> <s> therefore it is not possible or desirable to divulge that information <e> <s> as regards the second supplementary i understand that there is no evidence regarding the harmful implications to which he has referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for what he has said <e> <s> indeed the farm animal welfare council has been consulted on the use of bst <e> <s> the council has reported that there is no concern over short-term effects and the longer-term effects are being considered in the ongoing field trials <e> <s> in view of the evidence so far available i suggest to the noble lord that he should be reassured that with the bovine species there is an element of honesty and predictability <e> <s> indeed i think that we can all agree that cows will always be cows <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the procedures that are necessary for licence applications for the use of bovine somatotrophin i can confirm that those are being considered in accordance with the provisions and procedures of the medicines act and european community legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i have great respect for the noble lords ability as a farmer farming as he does not far from where i live

producers to achieve their quota with more efficient use of inputs <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord and of course i appreciate his skill in the medical profession <e> <s> i shall pass on his remarks to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that milk or meat would never be allowed to find its way into the food chain if the evidence had not been carefully scrutinised and accepted by the veterinary products committee <e> <s> we must agree that while consumer fears from whatever source should be respected and addressed nevertheless in deciding how to proceed in this matter we must go by the evidence <e>", "<cs> my lords i can reassure my noble friend that the results of the tests will be studied and acted upon <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the main thrust of the noble lords remarks there is definite evidence that there are no harmful effects to the consumer and the food chain <e> <s> on the rights of the consumer to be entitled to information the provisions of the medicines act to which i have already referred were put there by parliament so that <e>", "<cs> my lords i may have to correct my noble friend i think

government agreed to recast clause and schedule to the bill to improve the presentation on the face of the bill of the new succession rules for regulated tenants <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend that this is entirely a drafting amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> to the lords amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already spoken to this amendment <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords during debate in committee the noble lord lord carmichael moved an amendment to schedule of the bill whose cumulative effect would have been to require a ballot of parents on every proposal for delegation to a board <e> <s> at that time i suggested that the amendments were unnecessary in light of the extensive range of safeguards and provisions we have included in the bill to ensure that boards are representative and accountable <e>", "<cs> my lords we did of course have a most interesting debate during committee on the question of who should determine occasional holidays <e> <s> i appreciate the points made then about the need for a measure of co-ordination and the need for boards to observe authorities statutory obligations to provide in-service training days for teachers <e> <s> clause does of course oblige boards to act in accordance with their authoritys statutory and other legal duties <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join other noble lords in congratulating the noble earl lord longford on putting down this very apt unstarred question <e> <s> it further demonstrates the level of determination on penal matters which has long been associated with the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that there will be an independent element

encourages us to make everything as open as possible which is what he should be doing <e> <s> i do not think there will be anything secret about the matter but when i say that the answer is no that is

he wishes to establish what different attitudes towards training the government are trying to promote <e> <s> clearly some of these attitudes are directly evident from the new systems and mechanisms proposed in the white paper <e> <s> others however are only to be inferred indirectly <e> <s> that is why it is so constructive and useful to operate within the context of this kind of debate <e> <s> as a result we need not become bogged down with the contents of the white paper itself <e> <s> instead we can focus as your lordships have done on various connected themes about training and thereby in the light of these connections can attempt to judge which changes of attitudes towards training may now be desirable and practicable <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord suggests that the new arrangement is something radically different <e>", "<cs> in one sense it is not different at all <e> <s> it is simply an evolved way of addressing the problem <e> <s> he will not find anything radically different in the contact which he fears <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord studies recent experience he may not find that matters have become radically better <e> <s> at the same time he

north recommendation on clamps was that we thought that extended use would run the risk of undermining public acceptance of the need for and the desirability of clamping <e> <s> i assure my noble friend that our campaigns to deter people from failing to licence vehicles will not be neglected <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely accept the point made by the noble lord lord underhill <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords <e> <s> one recommendation of the north report to which we are giving serious consideration is that when cars are clamped in the normal way because a parking offence has been committed

for vehicle licence evasion from to or five times the annual rate of duty whichever is the greater <e> <s> there has been a slow but steady increase in the level of fines and penalties imposed by the courts <e> <s> since the average total penalty for vehicle licence evasion has increased by per cent <e> <s> to <e> <s> the department considers that this is too low to be an effective deterrent and

london to edinburgh to be able to relax in a city where as yet that practice has not been adopted <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my opening remarks improved technology is now in place at the centre

a private company owned by all the industry <e>", "<cs> i can assure the noble lord that as i always do i shall take his comments very seriously <e> <s> in coming back to him we shall bear this in mind <e>", "<cs> i hope that it will not take me too long to say what i have to say so that my noble friend lady gardner of parkes will be able to return <e>", "<cs> taking first the noble lords last point about the chairman of the electricity council i am sure he will understand that i cannot comment on the position of individuals <e> <s> the noble lord referred to the spirit in which the chairman and members gave their services to the boards <e> <s> we are talking here of a power of the secretary of state to compensate if he thinks it right <e> <s> he is not obliged to compensate <e>", "<cs> with regard to the noble lords first point these boards contain a core of full-time board members <e> <s> i shall indeed write <e>", "<cs> my understanding is that there is a mixture of both <e> <s> some full-time members are executives and some are non-executive members <e>", "<cs> i rather hope that the noble lord will agree with me when i tell him that what they are doing is a very good job <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord wishes to make that distinction then he is free to do so <e> <s> however i hope that on sober reflection and by sober i do not mean to imply that the noble lord is inebriated this is early in the day and none of us has had lunch and on considering the matter in context he will agree that it would be very unfair to make an exception of people just because they happen to be government appointees <e>", "<cs> the committee will be aware that at present the electricity industry in england and wales is treated as a single entity for the purpose of corporation tax with the electricity council being the body assessed for the activities of the thirteen boards in addition to its own <e> <s> the government believe that after the transfer date but for the purpose of dealing with matters arising before that date the existing tried and tested machinery for dealing with the industrys tax affairs should be preserved to deal with any outstanding liabilities <e> <s> part of that machinery is the ability of the council to call upon the boards for contributions towards corporation tax liabilities arising from the industrys activities <e> <s> that appears in section of the elecricity act which will be repealed on the transfer date <e>", "<cs> i can give my noble friend the assurance that that will always be the case <e> <s> where the contribution requested by the electricity council is very much in excess of what may be required the correct amount will always be refunded to the particular authority <e>", "<cs> it may help the committee if i first explain the purpose of clause <e> <s> this is necessary to enable the secretary of state to make with the approval of the treasury grants to any existing body that is any electricity board or the electricity council towards expenditure incurred during the transitional period between the transfer date and its dissolution <e>", "<cs> for the simple reason that every government amendment is important <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for moving his amendment which enables me to explain the purpose behind clause <e> <s> the constitutional practice is that members of parliament and members of the northern ireland assembly should not hold paid offices in the crowns patronage <e> <s> the successor companies will be formed by the crown and while they remain owned by the crown that is to say while their shares are held by the crown their directors may be nominated appointed or reappointed by a person acting on behalf of the crown <e> <s> clause therefore provides that a director of any of the successor companies appointed by a minister of the crown or by a person acting on behalf of the crown should not be a member of parliament or a member of the northern ireland assembly <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lords lord peston and lord williams for their close scrutiny of the draftsmanship of the bill for which my noble friend lady hooper and i are always extremely grateful even though we may not always be able to agree <e> <s> in this case the proposed amendment would ensure consistency with the drafting used in clause where transmission company first appears <e> <s> therefore it gives me great pleasure to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house be now resumed <e>", "<cs> first let me make it quite clear that this clause is about the provision of statistical information to the government <e> <s> that is information that is collected and aggregated for the purpose of measuring the contribution that the electricity industry makes to the economy of the united kingdom and its constituent countries <e> <s> it has nothing to do with regulation and should not be confused with the other powers in the bill which deal with the collection of other types of information <e> <s> for example the director has a duty under clause <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his comments <e> <s> he was kind enough to say that the government had quite a number of aspects for consideration here concerning the powers and the background <e> <s> we have considered this amendment sufficiently <e> <s> i do not wish to belabour the point any more <e>", "<cs> it may be of assistance to the noble lord if i remind him that information on the performance of companies will be collected and published by the director under clause <e>", "<cs> clause is a common provision in statutes <e> <s> it creates offences which can be committed by bodies corporate <e> <s> similar provisions can be found in section of the gas act and section of the telecommunications act <e> <s> clause enables the individuals responsible for the commission of an offence under the bill to be prosecuted and punished as well as the body corporate itself <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for elaborating further his concern <e> <s> the degree of knowledge and level of responsibility of the manager would be a factor to consider in deciding whether to bring proceedings and in considering the amount of any fine <e> <s> the word manager can be defined loosely <e> <s> one can manage at different levels <e> <s> the level of responsibility is judge <e> <s> the same goes for a secretary <e> <s> the term secretary may to a certain extent be vague but that is not to say that the level of responsibility or respective levels of responsibility of people who may hold the position of secretary in one sense or another are vague <e> <s> it is a question of judging the level of responsibility <e>", "<cs> picking up the remarks made by my noble friend lord mottistone perhaps i may say that his expression was not totally apt when he said that the noble lord lord williams was barking up the wrong tree <e> <s> indeed the noble lord seldom barks up the wrong tree and earlier in committee i think the reference was to barking up the wrong pylon <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure <e>", "<cs> offer my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt my noble friend but i must remind him that as we are on report one can speak only once <e>", "<cs> my lords clause of the bill already provides for a new system of guaranteed standards whereby domestic customers will have the right to be compensated if their local electricity supply company does not meet certain standards of performance laid down by the director <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord peston and lord ezra <e> <s> i believe that one of the concerns of the noble lord lord peston is to ensure that clause of the bill does not in some way prevent the importation of electricity from say france or any other country <e> <s> i assure your lordships that in no way does the clause prevent the importation of electricity <e> <s> after committee we wrote to the noble lord lord peston about the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords am grateful to my noble friend for drawing attention to the importance of clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord williams for putting forward his amendment <e> <s> under clause the public electricity suppliers are required to provide the director with specific information once a year about the number of cases in which compensation has been made under clause the aggregate value of that compensation and such information as the director may require about the overall performance achieved in respect of each standard determined under clause <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will be patient for a moment i shall come to the all-important distinction between regular and from time to time <e> <s> i shall take my time about it <e>", "<cs> the director my lords is required to publish the information at least once in every year so that customers or potential customers will be aware of their suppliers performance <e> <s> in this way the consumer will be provided with information as never before about his local electricity supplier and will know that there are pressures operating on him to improve his performance <e> <s> and the supplier will seek to improve his performance in competition with the other suppliers <e>", "<cs> my lords i always look at everything that the noble lord lord williams says in a very regular way not just from time to time <e>", "<cs> my lords this clause and clauses and need to be seen as a whole <e> <s> clause provides for the director to collect and publish information about the compensation in respect of standards of performance in individual cases under clause and the levels of overall performance achieved under clause <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked me perhaps to be more precise in defining overall <e> <s> i think that the best way in which i can define it is to say that it does not mean individual <e>", "<cs> my lords of course it is always important through the lengthy discussions that we are having on this long bill to be absolutely sure that we are all informed in the way that we should like to be informed <e> <s> i shall be very happy to write to the noble earl about this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to your lordships and to my noble friend lord peyton <e> <s> i have listened carefully to the arguments <e> <s> i do not wish to delay the house <e> <s> i will agree to take this hack without commitment and reconsider the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> he has no need to apologise at all <e> <s> the measure is i grant him a little obscure and he is certainly entitled as are all noble lords to an explanation <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> if it were not for the context he would be right to say that the word functions would be a very good word <e> <s> however in electricity industry statutes the word function is generally used to refer to the statutory powers and duties taken together of statutory corporations for example of the cegb <e> <s> however paragraph of schedule is concerned not with statutory corporations but with the cegbs successor companies <e> <s> the word functions is therefore inappropriate <e> <s> the purpose of the amendments is to delete the word functions where it occurs in lines and of paragraph and to substitute the word undertakings which is altogether more fitting to the activities of private sector companies <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the noble baronesss intervention <e> <s> it is precisely because of interventions such as those from the noble lord and the noble baroness that all the time in a steady way we are able to improve our drafting <e> <s> to pick up the point made by the noble lord lord jay as i understand it the term discharge can just as equally be applied to functions as it is to undertakings <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord lloyd is a hardy fighter <e> <s> he does not only just back winners he often picks horses which may not necessarily be thought capable of winning but do indeed come home <e>", "<cs> my lords i withdraw that remark <e> <s> the noble lord does not back horses <e> <s> perhaps there is some other sport <e>", "<cs> my lords to answer the noble lord there is a slight point of substance here <e> <s> there are two alternative routes one is that the secretary of state may receive representations alternatively and completely differently he may think that he should act even though he has not received representations <e> <s> if we were to delete those words as the noble lord suggests the secretary of state would be denied that alternative course of action <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give the noble lord that assurance <e> <s> it was a point raised by the honourable member for glasgow cathcart in another place <e> <s> it is an important matter in scottish law but it gives rise to nothing of substance <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that futher consideration on report be now adjourned until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should say to the noble lords lord peston and lord lloyd of kilgerran that the phrase may be so specified means specified in the notice by the secretary of state <e> <s> as was briefly touched on in committee clause is designed to ensure that the government can continue to obtain certain statistical information from the electricity industry after privatisation <e> <s> this will enable us to continue to prepare and publish a range of statistics about the supply and demand for electricity which contribute to our overall understanding of the economic development of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord in the flow of his remarks but as we are now on third reading it is only correct for speakers to speak once <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord ezra <e> <s> i apologise to him he is absolutely correct that at third reading he is entitled as are any of your lordships to seek clarification during the course of the remarks of any other noble lord <e> <s> he is correct when he makes the point that he will have spoken twice when he winds up the debate on the amendment which he has initiated <e> <s> one is not allowed to speak twice when one is not seeking clarification and not winding up a debate which one has initiated <e> <s> apart from that one may speak only once <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to begin by referring to the concern expressed by your lordships that an important measure such as the bill before us should be taken on a friday <e> <s> i appreciate very much that that concern comes from all sides of the house <e> <s> i shall certainly pass on those comments to the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the noble lord lord mackie or the noble lord lord carmichael precise details <e> <s> however i can assure them that the evidence was not just taken from schools that were going to be closed <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will permit me to write to him with full details of any slight changes there may be <e> <s> as i said earlier it was originally intended that there should be a significant change here but that was not proceeded with and as i understand it rectors are in the same position as they have been hitherto <e> <s> i believe there is a slight change in the arrangements for the principal to take part in chairing meetings in the absence of the rector which has not been the position until now <e> <s> however i will write to the noble lord with full details <e>"]
