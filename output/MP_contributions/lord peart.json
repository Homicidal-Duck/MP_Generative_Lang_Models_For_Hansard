["<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> i hope there will be no misunderstanding with the liberals about this my lords <e> <s> my task is to move that this debate be adjourned until tomorrow and it is for me to express some congratulations <e> <s> i regret that the noble lord lord mackie of benshie got it wrong on this occasion since he gets most things right <e>", "<cs> my lords we have a forecast of what is to happen when we examine the governments policy as outlined in the gracious speech <e> <s> most of us have been electioneering and we all know the issues and differences involved <e> <s> my side has been campaigning but unfortunately we lost and must accept what has happened gracefully <e> <s> there is now a new government and today i shall probe that government <e> <s> i must make a short speech because there are many members of your lordships house who wish to make a contribution <e> <s> as i say i want to probe the government and to know what they really intend as regards the nationalised industries <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that some speakers have dropped out of the debate i expected that i would have been speaking rather later <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble viscount for what he said <e> <s> i still feel affection for northern ireland i always have done <e> <s> it is probably because many years ago when i was a young student i carried out my first geological surveys there in county <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord the leader for his statement repeating what has been said in another place <e> <s> i am glad that our colleagues in another place are going to be helped <e> <s> but i think it is not the time now to debate any of these issues because colleagues in the house should examine the boyle report which is now available <e> <s> i think it is absolutely right that peers expenses should be raised at this time particularly those peers who live out of london and have to stay overnight <e> <s> i think the nation should understand that years ago the house functioned on a very part-time basis but it is now increasingly a legislative assembly <e> <s> indeed now that more senior ministers in the government sit in this house the accountability of ministers means that the duties of peers have become much heavier in the past few years <e> <s> i am glad that action is taken on this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord strathcona and mount royal for introducing this debate <e> <s> for a front bench speech his was short and concise although he may recall that when speaking to a motion on agriculture the other day i said we should try to keep our speeches to minutes and i will try to do that today <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord knows that that is not strictly true <e> <s> after all if we are to have a major agreement of this kind there must be trust on both sides <e> <s> i suspect that people who do not wish to see dtente working successfully are trying to create an atmosphere <e> <s> the noble lord and others who do not want the agreement to succeed are saying we cant trust the soviet union <e> <s> but we have to trust them <e> <s> we also have to trust the people who created the treaty <e> <s> one reads that there will be continual consultations monitoring and other action i cannot go into too much detail <e> <s> i believe that if we trust the soviet union then despite our differences we can show that the treaty can work <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to interrupt but as regards the russians i was trying to say that if one is involved in major negotiations and one seeks to have a treaty or an agreement inevitably each must trust the other to fulfil that agreement <e> <s> that is what i was trying to get across <e>", "<cs> that is absolutely right <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the leader of the house for repeating that very important statement in this house today <e> <s> first i would refer to the question of the vietnam refugees and especially the talk with mr kosygin <e> <s> i am very glad that we impressed upon mr kosygin our concern about the refugees and i am sure that the government have the support of the opposition on this question <e> <s> i was also glad that the prime minister told mr kosygin that her majestys government hoped that the salt ii treaty would be ratified quite a contrast to some of the attitudes and views which were expressed in our recent defence debate by some noble lords <e>", "<cs> what is the governments position on coal <e> <s> the green paper on energy aimed for million tonnes of coal production in the year <e> <s> do the government support this <e> <s> if so will the government give an unequivocal endorsement of the invest <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble viscount recognise that one agrees with examination of accounts and that is acceptable but this body has performed a very valuable service to the economy of this country and it is important from the point of view of the regions <e> <s> i hope the national enterprise board will not be axed <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that i personally deplore the action very much <e> <s> i support very strongly what the noble lord the leader of the house has said <e> <s> i regret that the union will not accept arbitration and i wish that it would think again about this <e> <s> i noticed that todays press said that they had been offered by the civil service department staged rises of up to per cent <e> <s> will the noble lord confirm that <e> <s> but even if this is so it shows that really it should go to arbitration <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether the business of the house will be severely affected and in what way <e> <s> i think it would be for the convenience of members if we knew <e>", "<cs> my lords we have just heard an interesting and fascinating speech <e> <s> i think that the noble lord had much to say <e> <s> i was rather surprised because he is usually a very effective debater and i admire his skill that he seemed a bit lost and finally he engaged in generalities <e> <s> may i say something to him about his early history before i deal with the motion <e> <s> he mentioned the period immediately after the war <e> <s> the noble lord and many others of us came hack from the services and we saw the beginning of a new britain a britain which in a period of time was built up and which also was envied by many other countries <e>", "<cs> my lords the biggest crisis in the balance of payments was in under the tories <e> <s> we created stability in that period and there is no doubt about that <e> <s> i remember along with my noble friend lord shackleton and others who lectured in the states in that period explaining what was happening in britain how even american society admired many aspects of life in this country especially the creation of the welfare state and the building up of the national health service <e> <s> i believe we achieved a miracle <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and now we are going to have a crisis in education <e> <s> this government will be cutting teacher jobs at a time when we need to train our young people in our schools <e> <s> their schools are not often cut i never hear of cuts at eton harrow winchester and places like that <e> <s> it is always in the state sector that we hear of such cuts <e> <s> why should that be so <e> <s> noble lords opposite know that they are now embarking on a wrong policy a policy which will be harmful to our economy because in the end we need skilled men and women in industry <e> <s> there is still too much snobbishness in our educational system in relation to the creation of engineers and that is true at all levels even in the universities which concentrate too often on pure science <e> <s> we need to train more engineers and i <e>", "<cs> the noble lord may remember that i was once put on a quango by himself <e> <s> it was the japanese prisoner of war fund but i did not get any salary <e> <s> however he was on a good quango and he never objected to that <e>", "<cs> i hope there will be no attacks on quangos again my lords <e>", "<cs> the lord president of the council the noble lord lord soames is looking rather worried <e> <s> i hope he will not worry too much and i certainly hope he will not fall for the change of title on the part of the tory party as suggested by his noble friend <e> <s> i read in the <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl care to look at the article <e> <s> it seems they are to be called democrats as though that were a new term <e> <s> i hope noble lords will concentrate on what is happening in our economy the budget the strategy of government and planning <e> <s> that is really what is important <e> <s> i believe that the labour government over a period of time pursued the right policy in relation to industrial strategy <e> <s> we tried to revive industry and we tried to create a better understanding with industry private and public <e> <s> indeed i remember hearing the noble viscount lord watkinson in a debate in your lordships house praising the planning agreements of the different sectors of industry and i thought he made a positive contribution <e> <s> i hope therefore from his vast experience that we shall hear him today making a case quite different from <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount praised the sector working parties and if he consults past issues of <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe the main effects of the chancellors budget will be to produce massive increases in unemployment with high prices <e> <s> even the road haulage association believes the budget will add million to the cost of road transport in the coming months <e> <s> there will be vast increases in indirect taxes and cuts in public expenditure which in the end are bound to raise prices <e> <s> the figure a cut of one-third of billion in the rate support grant is i believe likely to be met by terrific increases in rates and that will cause great hardship to many families in the country <e> <s> that attack on the rate support grant will therefore strike at the very heart of the wellbeing of the british people <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not an office which provides me with a brief probably that is why i now make better speeches <e> <s> however i hope that the noble lord will take note of what i have said <e> <s> i am sorry to say so but the noble lords speech lacked precision <e> <s> i hope that in the debate we will be able to examine critically what he has proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that i should now thank the noble lord the leader of the house for his statement and i am sure the house is grateful to him <e> <s> he has given a clear explanation of the increases in the peers expenses allowance and i believe the figures will show that this is a sensible advance <e> <s> i had the privilege of giving evidence with my noble friend the then chief whip to the boyle committee and i suggest we should now move on to the next business of the house i see no reason why we should not now accept the motion <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble viscount to think again <e> <s> surely he can give us a figure for the unemployment which will be created <e> <s> after all we are to have savings of million in expenditure of <e>", "<cs> could i just say to the noble lord that if he reads the examination results and admissions to oxford only this week he will see there that the comprehensive schools have really done magnificently in scholarships <e> <s> it is absurd to say that you cannot have in a comprehensive school an education suitable to the needs of the brilliant child that is an absurd position <e> <s> i admire the noble lord very much but i always used to regard him as lord tripartite he has always been a great defender of the three sectors and so he has made it plain again today <e> <s> this bill is a bad bill <e>", "<cs> what about shipbuilding <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley mentioned me specifically i would point out that i am not now the leader of the house <e> <s> the simple fact is that we would not have introduced a bill such as this <e> <s> i see nothing wrong in making a protest <e> <s> i do not accept that this is a breach of practices and procedures in the strict sense <e> <s> if we can exercise our right to vote and show our opposition that is legitimate for an opposition <e> <s> i never complained about the other side doing that when my party was in government so i think we are doing the right thing <e> <s> after all i remember the ship-repair legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret very <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that it is all right for the noble lord to talk about past history but here is an opportunity to provide jobs in the regions <e> <s> i believe that the regions have a right to have a share in the government of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will withdraw that statement otherwise i will pursue it <e> <s> the noble lord has made a terrible accusation <e> <s> he is simply wrong <e>", "<cs> but it will be printed <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had another important and interesting debate on regional policy and i welcome it <e> <s> may i say to the noble viscount lord trenchard that i wish him well <e> <s> he has had a good baptism in this house <e> <s> he does well at the box <e> <s> i know him from the old days <e> <s> he and i were thrown together a lot in the agriculture industry <e> <s> however i think that he is on the wrong path now and i regret it so it is more in sorrow than in anger that i say these words <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to question the minister about this matter <e> <s> it is a sensible order which has been approved by the appropriate committee and it means that the government will give assistance to improve plum trees in different parts of the country a worthy agricultural object which i would in no way wish to delay <e> <s> i am glad the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that explanation and as with the previous order i believe it essential that the government should have this one <e> <s> the noble earl mentioned food aid and there has been difficulty over this as he said i have with me a whole brief on the subject which i have collected myself including details of the whole impact on the tokyo round <e> <s> for example in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i have carefully read the statement and i must say that if i were in the position of the present minister of agriculture in europe i should have taken a similar stance <e> <s> i support very much what he has done <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say to the noble earl lord ferrers that i and i am sure the whole house are delighted at this new appointment <e> <s> i remember the long discussions we had on a major agriculture bill his ability i thought was such that he should be rewarded one day <e> <s> i am grateful that the noble lord lord soames has announced this <e>", "<cs> my lords now we turn to mundane matters <e> <s> i should like first to address my remarks to the noble lord who opened the debate <e> <s> he said that he did not speak for the government <e> <s> all i can say is that he made a very good case for the government and i remember listening to a very fine broadcast which be made on sound radio and thinking my goodness lord thorneycroft is again like he used to be years ago when i first knew him in captain peter thorneycroft who wrote a very fine pamphlet on development areas <e> <s> i am afraid he has become a little more right-wing since then and i regret it <e> <s> i do not think i have changed my stance at all <e> <s> i am proud to be a member of the labour party and i am proud to say that i am a socialist in the best sense <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and the problems of northern ireland as the noble lord lord blease has quite rightly said <e> <s> when i think of regional aid i think also of ulster <e> <s> so i argue that here we are still having virtually a two nation system and a most important policy which i feel is wanted is a good regional policy to revitalise these areas by attracting industry <e> <s> this is something about which we are very proud <e> <s> over the years the labour government have given much more regional aid than successive tory governments and i have a whole list of figures here to prove it <e> <s> i was glad to know what was said at the cbi the other day <e> <s> i do not know whether noble lords have read the speech of sir alastair pilkington i am sure he is not a supporter of the labour party but he emphasised the importance of regional aid <e> <s> it was not <e>", "<cs> actually my lords ilea has a fine record <e> <s> i know the tory party in london are trying to destroy it and trying to bring in something different which will not work <e> <s> i believe ilea should be defended <e> <s> every local authority in london even conservative accepts this <e> <s> i think he should have been better briefed on this <e> <s> i do not know who has advised him probably mrs thatchers office <e> <s> i think he has got it wrong <e> <s> but there again we are still living in a strange society where we separate our children at an early age <e> <s> i thought we were moving away from this <e> <s> i speak as a former school-teacher who taught in a grammar school <e> <s> i thought we were moving away from the tripartite system we debated <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt so late but very quickly on school transport it is essential in the rural areas <e> <s> how are the children to get to school <e> <s> they will probably have to go about six miles by bus <e> <s> this is the pattern in the rural areas <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will wish to thank the noble lord for making that business statement <e> <s> we of course understand that the other place should have as much time as possible to deal with a bill so important as this one <e> <s> this means that your lordships house will have only one day for discussion but we on this side will use our best endeavours to achieve completion of all stages of the bill that day <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> the tory party <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord cannot blame the previous administration <e> <s> in fact when i was minister of agriculture i always encouraged forestry sometimes before farming <e>", "<cs> my lords i find this extremely interesting because i remember the debate we had on this very issue when the roles were reversed and my noble friend lord winterbottom faced a barrage of criticism that night i thought most unfairly especially by spokesmen from the liberal side <e> <s> i am not an expert on aircraft although i was an anti-aircraft gunner <e> <s> every time i see these planes become airborne i shudder to think of the damage which can be done <e> <s> they are very fine aircraft <e> <s> the tornado has shown already that it is not only a fine aircraft <e>", "<cs> my lords to argue about school meals probably if he was at a private school he would have them in the normal way <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble lord is not going to be too casual about this <e> <s> here we are talking about the defence of the civil population <e> <s> this is a most important matter <e> <s> i hope the noble lord realises that what he has said reflects a measure of complacency <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say to the noble lord that i feel very sorry for him <e> <s> he is in a muddle with his business <e> <s> i am not in any way blaming him personally but this is a retreat <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for keeping me informed about this matter <e> <s> as he knows i was previously responsible for the civil service department <e> <s> i am worried that there might be savings at a cost to essential services <e> <s> i hope that this matter has been considered carefully and i should like to know what discussions the noble lord has had and which unions are concerned <e> <s> i get the impression that many members of the party opposite have always relished sniping at the civil service conscientious men and women many of whom will now probably lose their jobs <e> <s> it is not easy for these people <e> <s> i trust that there will be no endangering of essential occupations and i hope that the noble lord will comment on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate very much what the noble lord has said but i am worried about one matter <e> <s> the whole question of government stands on law and order and defence <e> <s> will there be any cut-back there <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house will be grateful for the statement of the noble earl lord ferrers about the leader of the house <e> <s> i am sure that the whole house will certainly wish to send good wishes and say godspeed to the noble lord lord soames <e> <s> he faces a great challenge and we all hope that he will achieve success <e> <s> may i say to the new acting leader that he need have no inhibitions <e> <s> i believe that he has all the qualities necessary for a leader of the house tact calmness and most of all a love of agriculture <e>", "<cs> yes carry on <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for coming to the house and stating what has happened in brussels <e> <s> the devaluation which he mentions will certainly be of great importance to british agriculture <e> <s> there is a problem here about the consumer <e> <s> the noble lord has spelled out that the effect on consumer prices will amount to of per cent <e> <s> on the retail price index and it will be many months before the full effects of this increase reaches the shops <e> <s> i hope the minister is being realistic here <e> <s> i am all for helping the farmers <e> <s> i recognise after all that the farmers produce food for the consumer <e> <s> there must be a proper balance <e> <s> i hope he has it right <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble lord will appreciate that i never said that indeed some of the critics did not <e> <s> i recognise the importance of the farming community and of having a healthy agricultural system <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been an interesting debate and a debate which has been worthwhile <e> <s> i thought at first that it could easily get bogged down but no i think we have had an excellent debate <e> <s> many of the points that have been raised are very germane to the problem and i believe that on another occasion we should return to this subject <e> <s> i was going to discuss the shapland report <e> <s> i read it carefully through last night i did my homework but there has been very little mention of it today so i hope that one day we shall come back to this subject <e>", "<cs> unpaid my lords i am sorry <e> <s> that is even worse <e> <s> this is a matter for the home office and i hope that the noble lord who is to reply to the debate will take up the interesting point that has been made <e>", "<cs> my lords we did some of it <e>", "<cs> come on <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord for repeating the statement <e> <s> it is a very important statement and i am sorry that her majestys government have been deficient in providing parliamentary time to discuss it <e> <s> no doubt noble lords will have seen some of the very effective television programmes on this matter but other countries in europe have been debating it in their chambers <e> <s> therefore i should like to chide the government for not offering time for the matter to be debated in parliament <e> <s> it is so important <e> <s> we should have had discussions well before a statement was presented to this house <e> <s> as i have already said other nato countries have had parliamentary debates on this issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that and i hope there will be a positive response <e> <s> i know that the noble earl lord kimberley is raising the matter at some time but i think that the government should provide time <e>", "<cs> may i make an appeal to the government front bench to concede our request <e> <s> i think my colleagues have been extremely reasonable and i urge the noble lord to accept that an opposition has its rights we believe that what we are suggesting is positive and constructive <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for having explained this very important award if i may use that term of million <e> <s> that is quite a considerable sum of money and i am glad that the money is to be injected in the hill and upland farm areas <e>", "<cs> please <e> <s> this is tedious <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we ought to get on <e> <s> i promise to be extremely brief and i always keep my promise <e> <s> i think it is good for the house because i once moved a motion that we should keep our speeches under or under minutes <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has made a very good speech and i think he might spoil it by wanting to speak again <e> <s> if he was sensible he would leave it as it is <e> <s> he made a good speech and i was going to refer to it <e> <s> may i congratulate the noble earl lord kimberley for introducing this debate <e> <s> we are all indebted to him <e> <s> it has been a good debate conducted without any passion or ill feeling and with analytical speeches <e> <s> may i say how much i enjoyed our two distinguished servicemen lord carver and lord hill-norton <e> <s> both in their own way made tremendous contributions <e> <s> i feel humble as a very junior officer in the army during the war but i am glad to say that today we have heard two excellent speeches <e> <s> i nearly converted to lord carvers point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that in an odd way i am wearing two hats <e> <s> i was once leader of your lordships house and also i know the difficulties from the point of view of the other place <e> <s> however i think the noble lord lord aberdare has put it correctly we must be very careful about this <e> <s> we do not have the accommodation here or certain facilities <e> <s> this applies even to another place <e> <s> therefore i welcome what he has said and i support him wholeheartedly <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord has got it wrong <e> <s> i am not at all anti-europe in any way <e> <s> what i was saying was that i think the report of the select committee is sensible <e> <s> it explains how even now we lack accommodation facilities for noble lords <e> <s> the facilities are dreadful <e> <s> with noble lords sharing desks the position is disgraceful <e> <s> i believe that even in the commons there is still a shortage of accommodation <e> <s> all i am saying is that if you do this you must go very cautiously but i think that the report is very sensible <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl give an assurance that the british sugar corporation which is a very important part of our economy will not be frustrated in any way even though we would still like also to help commonwealth producers of sugar <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether our decisions will be related to the commitments to nato <e> <s> we certainly had a very fine debate and different views were expressed and i hope that we will have a follow-up <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware that this is the first strike in the industry over the past years <e> <s> we are dealing here with a moderate union <e> <s> mr sirs is a very moderate trade union leader <e> <s> apart from that are the government not aware that in europe alone if we are to compare like with like in most of west germany belgium france and italy steel making concerns are in the red <e> <s> they are subsidised partly because of subsidies to the coking industry which supplies the steel industry <e> <s> is the minister not aware that there is a danger that if the closures that are now taking place continue our defence requirements will be hit <e> <s> that is very dear to the hearts of noble lords opposite <e> <s> no doubt we will discuss this in a future debate <e> <s> there was a question on the order paper only today about the situation regarding ships <e> <s> all this will be in danger <e> <s> worse than that if this policy continues the tory party will be said to have created industrial deserts where men and women have no work and where there will again be rising poverty <e> <s> the government have behaved deplorably in this matter and the men have been extremely reasonable <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene in the debate as an englishman because i know that this is a matter which is dear to the heart of scotland it is so important to scotland <e> <s> i have always taken an interest in fisheries <e> <s> i thought that i would look up <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble duke for clearing up that point because it is a very important matter <e> <s> so far as the administrative structure which will monitor the industry and the activities affecting sport as well as food is concerned it is important to have the right number and not a bureaucratic organisation <e> <s> i think this was stressed by the noble lord lord tryon <e> <s> i do not think that there is this bureaucracy <e> <s> i read carefully the debates in this house on the bills which became acts and the noble lord lord kirkhill steered this legislation through this chamber with great skill and i think they got it right <e> <s> on the other hand there are still problems and these have been mentioned in the debate today <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to ask her majestys government a question of which i have given private notice <e> <s> the question is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount lord trenchard for repeating the statement <e> <s> first i should like to ask the minister whether he can give an assessment his best assessment of the value of production lost as a result of this dispute <e> <s> as regards that the government have responsibility as well as those employed in the steel industry <e> <s> it has been suggested that there has been a conspiracy of silence with the cbi and the <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to raise a very short point <e> <s> in view of what the minister said that he is not sure about certain matters i would add that the question of aid from the community was revealed in a parliamentary answer by mr lester who is a parliamentary under-secretary of state for employment <e> <s> i am rather surprised that the noble viscount has not been briefed on this <e> <s> it was an answer on behalf of the government <e>", "<cs> they ought to <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble earl will appreciate that what was said earlier was not really factual <e> <s> we actually import million tonnes of sugar that was negotiated in the community and the commonwealth sugar producers were delighted at that <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for repeating that statement which is very important from the point of view of house business <e> <s> may i say that my colleagues and i and indeed colleagues in another place feel that we should have further consultations on this matter <e> <s> for that reason i am not going to commit the opposition to anything specific in regard to this statement <e> <s> i believe that we should have proper consultations and then we shall have to make our decisions when legislation is introduced <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not intend to be discourteous but i forgot to mention the admirable work done by the noble lord lord boyle and his colleagues <e> <s> it is quite a difficult job <e> <s> i should like to put that on the record <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord not heed what i think is the view of all parts of the house that a statement should be made a positive statement before the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for what the noble earl has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely with what the noble earl has said <e> <s> i remember that the motion i moved that we should shorten our speeches was carried overwhelmingly <e> <s> in yesterdays debate which was a very fine one members did basically keep to that rule <e> <s> our debates are far better when we have short concise speeches <e>", "<cs> my lords did the minister not consider giving old age pensioners butter at cheaper prices a token policy which was done under a previous administration <e>", "<cs> my lords surely it is important that the industry should know what is happening and how the government are responding <e> <s> i think it would have been sensible to publish a small white paper <e> <s> will the noble earl consider that <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the opposition i should like to say that all of us are so pleased that the noble lord has achieved success as i think he has and i should like to put that on record <e> <s> i think that he has done so well <e> <s> there are problems and there will be questions of aid later on and other matters but i think that this has been a major achievement <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount bear in mind that when noble lords talk about our competitors in europe many of those competitors have subsidised coal and indeed are subsidised considerably <e> <s> we are not comparing like with like <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a very long debate and a very good debate and i am glad it has not been a debate on party lines <e> <s> i was tempted to reply to one noble lord but he is not now in the chamber <e> <s> i see the noble earl lord cork is here now <e> <s> i was going to say that patriotism is not the monopoly of one party <e> <s> i was very proud to be in a cabinet where we had more serving officers at that period than any other cabinet had had in the history of this country <e> <s> i was very proud that i was a gunner <e> <s> we have listened to speeches representing various trends of opinion <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first congratulate the noble lord lord sandford on the way in which he introduced this most interesting report which i know most noble lords now in the house must have read carefully judging by the

fine speech which was recognised by the hear hears <e> <s> of the whole house <e> <s> i think that we should come to a decision and therefore i shall press the motion to a division <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord crowther-hunt made a fascinating speech <e> <s> he seemed obsessed with the influence of officials in the department of agriculture and indeed of ministers <e> <s> i would remind him that probably one of the best ministers we ever had was a miner tom williams <e> <s> apart from that i do not think it is necessarily an attribute that a minister should have when he

the industry has been in difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords let me say to the noble lord that i believe the proposal to reorganise local government has been disastrous has created terrible burdens and

lord houghton is a great man in this field but i think he ought to try to meet the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords i think my noble friend went a little further than that <e> <s> however i am glad i made the point <e> <s> thank goodness my noble friend and the noble earl have agreed <e> <s> i take the view that clause is the important part of the bill in many ways <e> <s> this provides for the

member of the economic forestry group <e> <s> coming to the bill i applaud the bill and i am glad that the noble lord lord somers has brought it back again <e> <s> it has been amended and it will be

say to the noble earl that whatever emerges there must be a prosperous steel industry <e> <s> so far the government have done irreparable harm all over <e> <s> i am rather surprised at that <e> <s> after all from the point of view of defence which is dear to the hearts of some noble lords opposite if we have a run-down of steel thus affecting industries involved in defence that would be a tragedy <e>", "<cs> may i support the noble lord <e> <s> we had a good discussion earlier and i welcome the bill <e> <s> i know that others took a different view but i believe that what the noble lord

important to the economy of this country that every care should be taken in relation to not only negotiations but also attitudes outside <e> <s> i think that the mining community sometimes feel that

also had a fine chairman in the person of the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe <e> <s> indeed we seem to have had excellent chairmen of the commission and i believe that that was due to ministers having a good appreciation of the qualities of the various chairmen <e>", "<cs> my lords that is something out of the blue <e> <s> it may well be because of the fragmentation of responsibility that we had in previous governments <e> <s> when first i was a forestry minister i was in charge but the last time i was a forestry minister i had to share my responsibility with the secretary of state for

spoken and this is a short debate <e> <s> by attitude i mean that i believe that we must have multilateral agreement <e> <s> i do not believe in unilateral disarmament <e> <s> i believe that that would be wrong for my country and for other reasons <e> <s> therefore i shall conclude on that note <e> <s> i do not disagree with my noble friend about his idealism he has a point of view <e> <s> i was simply highlighting what lord mountbatten said in that document <e>", "<cs> my lords that just proves that you must still try and try hard to get negotiations and get them round the table <e> <s> otherwise there is a bleak future for mankind <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank noble lords for what i think has been one of the best debates we have had in this house and indeed in another place for a long time <e> <s> it has been a good debate with some great arguments being adduced <e> <s> i will read carefully the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord for his statement <e> <s> i agree with his latter remarks but i should like to put some questions to him <e> <s> when i was in that position in charge and with the same responsibilities i was always ready to answer questions which came from the benches behind me <e> <s> first why are the government who are opposed to pay policy imposing one on one of the most reasonable and responsible groups in the country <e> <s> i deplore the action that is being taken but i still believe that common sense can prevail if there are more meetings and negotiations <e> <s> then i should like to know what is the new and ordered and agreed system for determining civil service pay <e> <s> how is it going to differ from pay research and a principle of fair comparison <e> <s> that was the system which we built up over a long period of time <e> <s> finally will this review and the new system be operative for the civil service pay settlement <e> <s> those are the few questions to which i should like to have answers <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a day when we can rejoice even though some people may not accept all of what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i believe that the government have done well on this <e> <s> i along with my noble friend lady llewelyn-davies of hastoe participated in the work of the boyle committee <e> <s> we gave evidence over a long period and i am glad to think that a good response has been made <e> <s> i should like to pay a tribute on behalf of all of us on this side to what the noble lord lord boyle has done <e> <s> here we see the culmination of something we hoped would happen <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount explain the difference in costs and how that has been taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord inglewood for introducing this bill <e> <s> i shall not elaborate on what he has said <e> <s> he has said everything and no doubt other noble lords may join in accepting the bill <e> <s> it is important for cumberland and i hope that the house will allow the bill to go through <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank the noble lord for that announcement <e> <s> i am sure that the whole house joins with me in wishing him a good voyage and in hoping that it will be useful in many ways <e> <s> we shall miss the noble lord but we recognise that he will be doing something positive <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether his strictures apply to the industrial civil servants who in reality form a large part of the civil service <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl lord ferrers for repeating the statement <e> <s> it is rather sad for many of us <e> <s> i feel it myself because years ago i was involved in a similar situation which we thought could be disastrous if it continued and i well understand the worries of the farming community and indeed of all the people in the ministry of agriculture including veterinary surgeons and advisory officers who are involved <e> <s> i am sorry that one member of parliament said that precautions lacked urgency this is in todays <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble viscount will accept that this scheme is really a successful one and that it is important that many of our future officers should be trained in mathematics and other matters which are essential in gunnery for example <e> <s> this applies also to the royal navy and the royal air force and so anyattempt to have criticism would be disastrous <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the opportunity again to debate agriculture <e> <s> i wish this debate had been a little later when the minister has returned from europe and when we know what has or has not been achieved <e> <s> nevertheless i am glad to have the opportunity to echo some of the difficulties which are affecting the farming community <e> <s> i have here a document which was presented to me by the national farmers union <e> <s> it was partly quoted by the noble lord opposite <e> <s> it is an excellent document <e>", "<cs> my lords wherever i have been even in the eec i have stood for british agriculture there is no question about that <e> <s> i know that the present minister is doing so and i believe that other ministers have done it <e> <s> certainly it is one of our greatest industries <e>", "<cs> perhaps he should have been court-martialled <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole house will basically support what the government have sought to do in brussels <e> <s> i know of the difficulties that arise there but i believe that our minister though his political point of view is different from mine has tried very hard and i am certain that at some time we shall achieve success <e> <s> unfortunately not all governments act in the same way and during discussions at the european council meeting last week it quickly became apparent as the minister said that one delegation was not able to negotiate on the question of access <e> <s> i assume that that was the french delegation <e> <s> of course we must recognise that they face problems but i believe that our stance has been right and i hope that we shall be able this spring to secure an agreement on a common policy <e> <s> there has been much controversy in the press regarding this matter and i hope that we can achieve success <e> <s> i think that the president was quite right in deciding that it would be wrong to prolong the meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the minister on the way in which he has presented this bill <e> <s> it is an important and a very detailed bill which we shall examine carefully in committee <e> <s> but it is a bill which i believe the industry will welcome <e> <s> i hope that speeches will be such that that spirit will continue and that this bill will become a milestone if i may use that term in the history of the fishing industry <e> <s> having been a fisheries minister over a long period i know the problems of that industry but i think we can now see a way ahead <e> <s> admittedly we still have problems with the community <e> <s> i was never involved in any discussions with the community on fish as such <e> <s> i am not certain whether my noble friend lord ross was <e> <s> i think he was several times <e>", "<cs> well my lords there is no reason why he should not say no <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the two noble lords who are involved in this matter <e> <s> i expected the same speech from the noble earl lord halsbury as the one which he made previously or a similar speech and also a similar speech to the one which has been made by my noble friend lord houghton of sowerby <e> <s> i think that the logic of their argument inevitably is that it would be wise for our noble liberal colleague to withdraw his amendment because i think that it would spoil the bill and spoil the atmosphere in which we are debating this limited clause <e> <s> so from the point of view of the opposition i would advise my colleagues to support the noble earl lord halsbury and also my noble friend lord houghton of sowerby <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say to the noble lord lord beaumont that i followed carefully his approach <e> <s> he is an environmentalist and i understand him raising that flag <e> <s> however there are other matters in the community and other matters in farming for example which are probably more important in certain circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for paying tribute in the way that he has <e> <s> i am sure that all our liberal colleagues in the house will feel very sad at the loss of a most distinguished liberal politician <e> <s> the noble lord lord soames mentioned lord reas fine war record in the last war in his organisation of resistance <e> <s> i believe that he also participated in the war before that as a guardsman <e>", "<cs> i want to concentrate on the structure the set-up in other words the organisation of the sea fish industry <e> <s> i do not disagree with the noble lord lord campbell of croy <e> <s> i believe that he welcomed this bill and i more or less agree with what he has said <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble earl this question <e> <s> which minister apart from the minister of agriculture will be responsible in the end <e> <s> what about northern ireland <e> <s> i assume the secretary of state for scotland but what about wales <e> <s> i hope we can have an answer on this <e> <s> i want to stress the difficulties of clause which provides for the establishment of a sea fish industry authority consisting of not more than members four of whom would be independent of and eight of whom would be representative of the sea fish industry <e> <s> the duties and powers of the authority are largely those of the white fish authority and of the herring industry board bodies which the authority replaces <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say from the opposition front bench that i am grateful for the way in which the noble viscount has treated this question <e> <s> i think my noble friend has put her finger on something which is very important namely to create an organisation for the defence of our country but may i ask the noble viscount to reconsider this and perhaps during the defence debate which we shall soon be having he will be able to give a further report <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side welcome what has happened and i believe that this is a great step in the right direction <e> <s> i have always argued that we must get salt ii and iii and all that going despite the scepticism of certain people in this country and other countries <e>

arrogance which ought to be counteracted <e> <s> i am sorry to say that <e> <s> i am asking the noble viscount will he very soon give us an opportunity to question this poilcy <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we have had an excellent debate and i want to congratulate the noble baroness lady vickers on her speech <e> <s> she has always had a great affection for the navy <e> <s> she represented a seat

grateful to the minister for what he has said <e> <s> it is a minor anomaly and i am sure our scottish friends will agree that there is a point in making this apply in the same way as they have for a period <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble earl will be sympathetic to my noble friends plea <e> <s> what he has said is correct <e> <s> it is right that it should be on the record that the government accept basically what my noble friend wants <e> <s> so i hope that the minister will reply in a positive way <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble earl will assume that the opposition also wishes our negotiators the very best <e> <s> it is an important section of the industry <e> <s> i know we have debated the fishing industry just recently but this affects the inshore people who are so

lords i have taken careful note of what the noble lord has said and we regret that no settlement has yet been reached <e> <s> this is the important point <e> <s> i should like to know whether the noble lord is still pursuing the matter with the unions after all we all want to avoid an all-out strike <e> <s> i wish to ask the noble lord as i have done on a previous occasion whether the government are to think in terms of a new and ordered agreement system for determining civil service pay <e> <s> this is vital <e> <s> i had all this difficulty myself <e> <s> i appreciate and
