["<cs> my lords i am reminded a little of an occasion when i conducted the three hours devotion and in the central hour the congregation shrank to one but we kept going <e>", "<cs> my lords i look forward to hearing the noble baronesss answer and in particular i am anxious to know the reasons that lie behind this hostility towards board and lodging accommodation for the young unemployed <e> <s> i favour regulations that prevent exploitation of this most vulnerable class <e> <s> i favour regulations that encourage people to stay at home <e> <s> for most people there is no better place to be <e> <s> yet there are three reasons why it is inevitably desirable that many of these young people leave home <e> <s> i find it difficult not to believe that when they do board and lodging accommodation for many of them is the best thing for them <e> <s> they need to leave home to find work <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that matters of this nature which impinge in many ways on questions of morality and which are of general public concern highlight the wisdom of local education authorities having co-opted representatives from the churches and other concerned bodies <e>", "<cs> whether the amendments are accepted or rejected and i refer in particular to amendment no <e> <s> i hope the minister will be able to give some sympathetic encouragement to the concerns the amendments reflect <e>", "<cs> i should be grateful for some guidance <e> <s> i think that i may be speaking to the wrong amendment <e> <s> my amendment quite deliberately says nothing at all about sanctions <e> <s> it is about the purchasing power of the local authority to buy what it wants to buy to buy british if it likes <e> <s> it is quite untrue that i have been advocating sanctions as the noble lord has just said <e> <s> i might or i might not but that has not been my concern today <e> <s> my concern has simply been to say that the local authority has a moral right to buy british or whatever else if it so wishes and it is misleading to say that the authority is interfering in international affairs <e>", "<cs> exactly <e>", "<cs> that happens not to be true <e> <s> i do not think that that remark about the world council of churches should be repeated <e>", "<cs> can i ask the noble earl to confirm that it would be illegal under this measure for a local authority to insist on a buy british policy for any of its contractors <e>", "<cs> i do not think any useful purpose will be served by saying anything further <e> <s> i believe that the main point has been missed by many speakers the right of local government to choose <e> <s> if we follow the line that has been taken by many on this side of the committee i fear we are putting a firm end to a long and distinguished chapter of english history and i regret it <e> <s> however i still want the amendment to go forward <e>", "<cs> my lords to future generations our general failure to cope with sympathy and kindness with the problems of the mentally ill will seem one of the more astonishing features of our age <e> <s> however that is not the subject of this bill <e> <s> as we have been told and know the bill deals with one specific set of problems <e> <s> i lead a more sheltered life than some other members of this house and my experience has not been so much directly with schizophrenics as with their families who deal with those who have this appalling problem of not knowing where they are who are in and out of hospital and who bear the uncertainty of what horrors tomorrow will bring <e> <s> those problems have already been mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords in welcoming the part played by her majestys government in bringing this unexpected hope of independence and peace in namibia i ask the government to use their influence to ensure that swapo is involved to a greater extent in the necessary negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am familiar with the circumstances of which the noble lord speaks <e> <s> i regret the suggestion he makes that there must have been something improper in an archbishop receiving an organ transplant of the sort about which we are speaking <e> <s> i am assured that it is entirely untrue <e> <s> it was a gracious offer generously received <e> <s> any suggestion that undue influence took place is not true <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that with the vagaries of the british climate it is extremely unlikely that an april easter would have given a finer sunday than we had last sunday which will be easter day next year <e> <s> therefore does he agree that the way forward might be to restore the greatly valued link between the spring holiday and whitsun which was so unfortunately broken some years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall take your lordships on an even longer journey in your minds than ceylon and caracas <e> <s> the other day i instituted a new vicar in a parish in the inner city of sheffield <e> <s> that is a very short journey <e> <s> i meditated on the curious dedication of that church to william temple a rare dedication for a church <e> <s> at a time when archbishops were in the news i found myself wondering what it was that gave william temple such a hold on peoples minds and hearts in the war years when he sadly died <e> <s> i came to the conclusion that it was because he expressed in his teaching and his ministry a belief that it was at least worth trying to build jerusalem in englands green and pleasant land <e>", "<cs> my lords again before the noble lord sits down i wish to assure him that my crook is firmly in my hand and at this moment the dogs are hard at work <e>"]
