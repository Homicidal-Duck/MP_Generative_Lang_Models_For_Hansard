["<cs> i intend to speak but i do not know whether the minister would prefer to reply first to my noble friends most moving and well-informed speech <e> <s> we have been hearing about a conference on suva and that there was still chance of some form of agreement <e> <s> i quite understand the reason why the government wish to try to proceed with this with due speed <e> <s> to have the second reading on a thursday night and proceed with the committee stage on tuesday which means that for amendments to get on the marshalled list they have to be drafted within a minute or two of the conclusion of the debate on thursday night and then to table a motion that all stages should be taken today appears to me to be dubious <e> <s> but i am a tyro and more or less unknown and i carry no weight in this house except such weight as is inevitable <e> <s> if the minister would prefer to intervene now i will give way but if not i wish to speak in support of what my noble friend has said and i hope that i shall not detract from an admirably phrased speech <e>"]
