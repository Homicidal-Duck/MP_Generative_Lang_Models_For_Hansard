["<cs> my lords first may i congratulate the noble viscount lord trenchard with whom in the past i have had some friendly arguments across the floor of the house <e> <s> i also wish to congratulate other noble lords who now occupy the government benches <e> <s> judging from what was said by the first two or three speakers in the debate it seemed that it was more to do with genealogy than with priorities the genealogy of my noble friend lord melchett <e> <s> he did not raise the matter but it seemed that almost everybody else did at that stage <e> <s> i began to feel that i should be most deprived at the end of the day that i should not be able to participate in this particular race <e> <s> i feel some sympathy with the noble viscount lord trenchard while i say hurrah and hooray to the noble viscount lord rochdale and the noble lord lord mottistone for speaking from the other side of the house and at least introducing some debate on the question of priorities to match what sounded to me at any rate like an extremely high-grade university or wea seminar <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble viscount will allow me the example i mentioned was bread i understand that in the pipeline it was probably p but when the price commission went the demands from the bakers were accepted and it went up by p <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that the question which has been put by the noble earl refers to repetition of this conduct <e> <s> my noble friend is asking this is something about which many of us on all sides of the house are concerned that where there is a mural <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the cut in the money given to the arts council by the present government which was certainly not one of the promises in the manifesto and also in view of the high increase in vat can the noble lord give us any more information as to what lines the national heritage fund will take and whether in fact there will be more money diverted from it than has yet unfortunately been expected <e> <s> since the amount of money needed is much greater than i think any of us had hitherto thought concerning what we in the last government were all trying to accomplish in the white paper which was published how does that tie up both with regard to the cuts in public expenditure which could affect such bodies as the historic buildings council and also the expenditure for the national heritage fund <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that a woman who is a citizen of any other eec country may come to britain and bring her overseas husband with her <e> <s> this puts british women in an absolutely absurd and iniquitous position <e> <s> is the noble lord further aware that countries such as the united states sweden and israel treat men and women citizens alike and there is no bar on foreign spouses <e> <s> perhaps he could let me know whether there is any developed nation which discriminates against women in the way that is proposed by this government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to intervene again but in view of <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may interrupt the noble lord since he has said he would be leaving early <e> <s> i am rather puzzled as to why he refers to them as so-called cuts <e> <s> if they are only so-called why are inroads being made into education the social services and everything else <e> <s> i can understand <e>", "<cs> it is still not clear <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the most attractive features in this debate initiated by the noble lord lord thorneycroft has been the four outstanding maiden speeches that we have had <e> <s> other noble lords who have been in the house longer than i have will know whether this has been so on other occasions but i should have thought that this occasion was probably unique <e> <s> my very old friend the noble lord lord lever of manchester gave us a brilliant dissertation on exchange controls which has made me decide that perhaps i will not mention them again because i do not quite agree with him about it and also on general government policy <e> <s> my noble friend lord stewart of fulham without a single note made a most felicitous speech <e> <s> i had the feeling that if it had not been a maiden speech he might have taken rather a harder line certainly on the question of the education cuts <e> <s> my noble friend lord irving of dartford concentrated particularly on the micro-chip industry and what was happening there and it was so interesting that one did not have to go through the formality of offering empty thanks <e> <s> the noble lord lord harris of high cross made an extremely witty speech <e> <s> his economic feelings showed of course but we know them and since his recreation is conjuring and devising spells against over-government we shall evidently hear quite a lot from him about that in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister care to tell the house what the rate of inflation was when the government came into office and what it is today <e> <s> if not perhaps i could remind him <e>", "<cs> my lords when i asked the minister a similar question last week as to whether he could produce evidence of the abuse he said this was a fair point and he proposed to deal with it as i understand it in the white paper <e> <s> has he not again in his first answer referred to the exploitation of the present system <e> <s> so far as i can see however we have had no evidence of what this abuse is and how far it has gone <e> <s> is the noble lord going to produce this evidence <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not only the weather that is very bleak today <e> <s> we have now heard that the minimum lending rate is going up to per cent <e> <s> which is the highest in the history of the united kingdom <e> <s> the governments rigid stance on monetary policy which has <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i want to ask the minister a question <e> <s> he did not answer any of my previous questions <e> <s> as he has made a major point of inflation will he please answer this specific question does he disagree that inflation could reach per cent <e> <s> or more next year i should like to have an answer that is on the record <e>", "<cs> my lords what is the noble lords forecast <e>", "<cs> my lords i would say that that was a very surprising statement except that we probably knew what was coming and i would say with respect i do not think anything that comes from the department of industry now and from the secretary of state is surprising at all <e> <s> the secretary of state has said many times that he does not want to interfere with management in fact he said last week i am no manager yet he has taken away a subsidiary from a holding company which goes right against the grain of any proper corporate industrial organisation and i would say that the new board however distinguished know very well that they will have no real independence <e> <s> that is quite implicit in their appointment they know very well how the cookie is going to crumble <e> <s> it is also highly doubtful whether they will attract staff of the high quality which has been working with the neb up to now and which is one of the most important reasons for keeping the neb in its present form <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to take up that point with the noble viscount <e> <s> what i said was that their independence would not be the same as that of the present neb because they knew perfectly well what the situation was <e> <s> that is the point <e>", "<cs> my lords may i compliment the minister on making the totally incomprehensible slightly more comprehensible although i would not say that even with his explanation it is something that one would want to put to music <e> <s> it is still a complicated document and the formulae are particularly so <e> <s> i accept that up to now both parties have been in favour of the cumulo system <e> <s> at the same time i understand the feeling of the local authorities associations especially the acc and the ama who feel that it deprives many of their member authorities of rate income to which they feel entitled <e> <s> this is because the present cumulo varies with the number of firms supplied per mile of trunk main and where the number of firms does not increase and extra miles of gas main are brought into use this appears to them to result in a reduction of the cumulo and therefore a reduction in their rate income <e> <s> with the coming into operation of the mid-suffolk compressor station here again it is felt by many local authorities that the total cumulo should not merely be redistributed but that these new facilities should produce a new rateable value <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i press him further <e> <s> perhaps he will write to me i do not expect to have an answer now <e> <s> regarding the rural areas it is not a question of the distribution of gas it is that they are areas which are better recipients of the building of compressors <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will write to me and give me some idea of the distribution between urban and rural areas of the compressors that have been built <e> <s> that really is the point the actual building of the compressors <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously with the rise in house prices which has been so dramatic in the last few years it would be quite unrealistic to oppose this unfortunate increase <e> <s> i must warn the noble earl that i am feeling neither comatose nor particularly uncontentious this afternoon <e> <s> this highlights the governments catastrophic economic and financial policy <e> <s> if people can borrow more then they will be enabled to pay more for their houses <e> <s> all the measures which we have seen over the last few weeks the government have been very anxious to say are in order to bring down inflation but this means that inflation is going to go up again in a further spiral <e> <s> the increase is to keep pace with inflation but one has to be earning in excess of a year to be able to pay interest on a advance <e> <s> the effect of this order is to help people with higher incomes but not those with lower incomes <e>", "<cs> my lords i wanted to intervene at the point where the noble earl was talking about exempting householders from the effects of inflation by making them a special class <e> <s> i entirely agree with him <e> <s> i was not arguing that nor would i what i was saying was that if the minimum lending rate had not been put up to per cent <e> <s> recently the mortgage rates would not have gone up as well <e> <s> i am not asking that mortgages should be exempt this would make nonsense <e> <s> it is the whole way the financial policy is being carried out that i disagree with so fundamentally and which i think is causing this hardship and chaos <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble earl for the polite and nice way in which he has dealt with the matter although we disagree fundamentally and for allowing the debate to widen beyond the order <e> <s> indeed my lords i appreciate that <e> <s> i have asked him two questions and i do not expect an answer now <e> <s> if necessary perhaps the noble earl will write to me about the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord avebury for providing the opportunity for this debate and i look forward to hearing the maiden speech of the right reverend prelate <e> <s> this however is a debate which should not have to take place in a society which prides itself on its tolerance although there are unfortunate myths among the finer realities <e> <s> what then is it all about <e> <s> it is about a government trying to come to terms with the countrys racially prejudiced and coming unstuck <e> <s> the conservative manifesto listed eight points on immigration <e> <s> the four main ones were the establishment of a register a quota the restriction of elderly and young immigrants and ending the labour governments concession to husbands and male fiancs <e> <s> it is to their credit that the government have recognised the folly of the register and the quota and have dropped these <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord would give way since he mentioned me in connection with this point <e> <s> the rules were drafted in order to deal with this very point <e> <s> now people have to have been married and appear to have stayed together in a per <e>", "<cs> but my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the minister did not mean to be unfair but i think he was being a little unfair in saying that i did not draw attention to that <e> <s> i did say that the restrictions before these rules were already very hard harder than many of us would have liked to see but the added criterion of living at a standard of living lower than they would have or could have over here makes it even more difficult <e> <s> this is what creates the catch position <e> <s> i entirely accepted that the other criteria were the same but now something else is added which makes it even more difficult <e> <s> in fact i read out what mr raison had said in another place in order to make the point that this should have been thought out before <e> <s> it was not a case of not referring to this matter i did refer to it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> perhaps i did not make it quite clear <e> <s> i was really talking about the man who comes and is going to marry a british woman in this country and wants to stay rather than if he comes as a visitor has to go back and then come back to marry <e> <s> it was a question of whether he could marry and stay not to go back <e>", "<cs> my lords following the ministers very clear welcome and factual explanation of what happens under the act may i ask whether he would not agree that in fact the problem raised by the noble lord lord orr-ewing really applies to a minimal number of people and it seems a pity to do what really results from this which is to run a racist hare <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to my noble friend lord walston for introducing a motion on this very important report <e> <s> i would also like to congratulate the royal commission with its wide and distinguished range of experience on a report which although dealing with so much technical material is clearly written comprehensible that is nearly all of it to the lay person and constructive but not extravagant in its recommendations <e> <s> i am very delighted that my noble friend lady white is speaking later in the debate <e> <s> i must at this stage apologise to the house that because of an unbreakable commitment i may have to leave before the end of the debate <e> <s> i have apologised to the minister <e> <s> he was very kind about it and i apologise now to the rest of the house <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am sorry if i gave that impression <e> <s> i did not go into the matter because nitrates is an extremely complicated subject <e> <s> however i was giving the example of how one had to be careful about water and nitrates in water and what one did <e> <s> i gave the example of what happened during the drought <e> <s> i am not prepared to say how it should be solved <e> <s> this is something which affects agriculture the environment and the water authorities themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i was at that point quoting from the report <e> <s> i think it refers somewhere to during the last decade but no doubt it meant that you were all doing much better during the last decade not that nothing had been done before <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister has answered in terms of numbers and then percentages of public expenditure can he give any idea of how this equates with the cut in services to the community which is what so many people are suffering <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect that is not the question i asked the minister <e> <s> i was asking as a question whether he would explain the relationship between the numbers reduced which he has produced and the level of services to the people <e> <s> i was not talking about expenditure <e> <s> i was talking about the personnel and the services <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord kennet for introducing this debate this evening <e> <s> he put a number of questions to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate which will save me repeating some of them <e> <s> the question as to why he is doing it himself i will leave him to answer although i suspect it is his interest in trade <e> <s> at the time when i replied for the government to the debate to which my noble friend referred in february i would very much have welcomed a lord advocate to take the task off me but once i got steeped in the subject i found it so fascinating and so urgent that not only was i glad to have the opportunity to do it but i agree with my noble friend that the environmental side and the part played by the department of the environment should not only be kept as it is but in fact should be increased <e>", "<cs> my lords i was quite aware of that <e> <s> the noble lord has just spoiled a very good joke <e> <s> i was going to say that the present chancellor of the duchy of lancaster has enough on his plate with the arts and the leadership of the house <e> <s> i know the noble lord was referring to lord lever <e> <s> in reply to that debate what i said was <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the minister for that statement which we have at last had <e> <s> but even more eagerly than we have awaited it have the local authorities been waiting to find out how they can plan for the coming year <e> <s> the cut because of the single block arrangement has now been gathered together and referred to in the statement as a cut which is per cent <e> <s> lower than the forecast outturn compared with last year <e> <s> however the million spent converted into prices shows a cut of million over last year which is almost one-third <e> <s> local authorities also asked for million for this coming year so the cut really is one half <e> <s> in fact the cut is very much more severe than the statement indicates <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to refer to two points <e> <s> first i think that it is very easy for figures to become confusing when they are thrown across the chamber <e> <s> i still maintain that the cut is much greater than it appears to be <e> <s> i should be grateful if the minister could write to me to that i can see the figures set out <e>", "<cs> i should like to second this amendment which was really the child of my noble friend lord donaldson of kingsbridge and myself <e> <s> in doing so as i was unable to be here at the second reading i should like to say how happy i am to see this bill making its way as i hope it will so early in the governments career to the statute book and also how pleased i am that it covers so closely the white paper for which i and my colleague were responsible in the last government <e>", "<cs> just in order not to confuse the committee i think it was due to getting the page number wrong i do not think it was the intention of my noble friend and it was certainly not my intention that the word memorial should be left out of line in the long title <e> <s> i certainly think it should be there <e> <s> it is when it becomes a working title that i think it should be left out <e>", "<cs> i obviously have not made myself clear <e> <s> i want to retain the word memorial in the long title then when it goes on to clause to say there shall be a fund known as the national heritage fund <e> <s> i hope that the committee will agree with me that whether the explanation goes into the preamble or whether it goes in where we have suggested or whether it goes into the long title i think we probably would be willing to leave to the government as long as it is explicitly stated somewhere where people will see it and understand it <e>", "<cs> i shall be brief so that the committee can get on <e> <s> i cannot let clause which deals with the financial side of the bill and therefore i do not think it would have been possible for me to table an amendment pass without referring to the finances of the fund <e> <s> it will be given initial capital of million plus in april next that is if one subtracts the million for money in lieu and we must accept that in these hard times million plus is all the country can afford this year <e>", "<cs> in that case may i ask the minister whether the amount that was taken out and if one translates that into let alone values it is a large amount will certainly be taken very strongly into consideration <e> <s> there is money owing to this fund i am not asking for an increase which has to come out of the air as it were as if there were no background for it <e> <s> the fund has a priority claim as a follow-on from the national land fund <e> <s> we should like to be assured of that otherwise it will be forgotten and all disappear <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to what the noble lord lord sandford said and to the ministers reply <e> <s> i appreciate both what the noble lord lord sandford is trying to do and his interest in this matter <e> <s> i must confess that i think that the government are right over this one <e> <s> i think that the word preserve embraces restore to the extent that one needs it to do and that it covers retaining too <e> <s> the other point is where does one stop <e> <s> one could include the word conserve and a great many other words <e> <s> i think that the matter is much better left in this way <e> <s> from my experience of dealing with the historic buildings council i think that this is the way the provision should work and that the matter should be left open as far as the government have it set down in the bill itself <e> <s> frankly i should prefer to see this provision left as it is <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment moved by the noble <e>", "<cs> i must agree with the noble lord lord vaizey over this <e> <s> i found the answer extraordinary <e> <s> we get back to the crux of it which is that if the bill is meant to include archaeology and archaeology is accepted as part of our heritage why are the government not prepared to put in the word so that it is on the face of the bill as well as in the intention of it <e> <s> i take the ministers word personally but in this context we have only his word for it <e> <s> since reading <e>", "<cs> i think this is a very complicated subject and the minister may well be right in saying that perhaps the drafting is not quite correct <e> <s> however i think it is the point of principle we are really concerned with <e> <s> as i understand it he is saying that if the trustees want to buy land and in buying that land they acquire the associated rights that is correct <e> <s> but what this amendment is getting at is to be able to buy certain rights without buying the land <e> <s> if it is possible to do that it seems to be quite wrong for the trustees or anybody else to be either forced or encouraged to buy land when all they want is certain rights over it <e> <s> when the minister asks where it would end and when he says that it is very difficult to judge how much land would be needed those surely are matters we need not be too concerned with as regards the bill <e> <s> they are a question of arrangement and negotiation between the trustees <e> <s> there are legal questions involved and so on <e> <s> all i want to know is this is it possible to buy associated rights under the bill as drafted <e> <s> because i think if i understand it correctly there is a certain difference of legal opinion about that <e> <s> if i may say so this is not clear from what the noble lord has said so far <e>", "<cs> i do have a great deal of sympathy with the minister quite seriously because it is a very difficult and technical matter and one is sometimes in a difficult position when shall i say <e> <s> the pigeon arrives at the last moment and one has to read out the information and sometimes the handwriting is not quite clear <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it would be for the convenience of the committee if we also discussed amendments nos <e> <s> and because they are on the same point <e>", "<cs> i shall be moving amendment no <e> <s> which covers the same point and which i prefer to the amendment moved by the noble duke <e> <s> i prefer to keep the word improving in connection with access <e> <s> i spent many years trying to improve access to various places and i think that the word is simpler <e> <s> i know that the word reasonable goes through finance acts and other acts and i was always trying to get that changed to adequate <e> <s> therefore i think that improving access is a better phrase <e> <s> having said that i find that i am in opposition to myself since amendment no <e> <s> seeks to insert the word controlling <e> <s> as i have said i have always been anxious to increase access because i think that there should not be financial privilege whether by way of taxation or grant without social responsibility <e> <s> this is the right place to pay tribute in passing to the many house owners all over the country who give access beyond what they are asked to do <e> <s> i have had the opportunity to visit many of those houses <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies i should like to make one point <e> <s> in the subsection as it is now and this was put in to the bill in another place it says interest if any on any such loan and the noble lord has made quite a lot of the point that as i understand it they would be able to make a loan at a low rate of interest <e> <s> i find that extremely doubtful <e> <s> i really cannot envisage the treasury giving permission for a loan at a low rate of interest <e> <s> i just cannot see it happening and in fact in another place in standing committee f <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it would help the committee as we are taking these amendments together if i spoke to my amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i shall be brief because i am conscious that time is going by and the one thing that we do not want to do is to lose the bill by drawing out the proceedings <e> <s> i do not altogether go along with the amendment of the noble lord lord reigate mainly because if there is no time limit i do not think that it has a chance at all <e> <s> i should like to see the trustees having a certain amount of discretion in the event it may be the very rare event when they have to step in very quickly to get a picture or house where negotiations take time otherwise it might be lost <e>", "<cs> it is too late <e>", "<cs> may i apologise <e> <s> i do not suppose it can be struck from the record <e> <s> i made a mistake perhaps because we skipped one or two amendments <e> <s> as is absolutely clear my noble friend and i are not in total agreement over this <e>", "<cs> as i said earlier i consider that the noble marquess has turned the whole thing on its head and has gone too far but i think that he has done great service in spelling out this side of the problem <e> <s> having had the opportunity to visit his lovely house and to see the objects there i can appreciate the problem <e> <s> although i personally should have liked to see something spelt out rather more clearly in the bill and in more detail though on the whole this is an extremely clearly drafted bill on the lines of the amendments that were to be moved by the noble duke the duke of grafton i must acknowledge that we have come a long way in the appreciation of leaving objects <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend on this amendment <e> <s> on this we are in complete agreement <e> <s> i think it is very important that a permissive power should be in the bill for payment to the chairman but i agree with my noble friend not necessarily to the trustees <e> <s> we have seen such cases <e> <s> the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor when the payment for cabinet ministers came up accepted the principle of it but refused the increase himself as i believe did the prime minister <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may interrupt <e> <s> could the noble lord tell me why it would diminish the chairman to be paid <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister feels diminished as a minister because he is paid <e> <s> i do not feel that he is diminished i do not feel that he is paid enough <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister has said and we know that the treasury is making more money available for this particular scheme is she taking into account what was said by several of her noble friends including the noble lord lord butler in the second reading debate that the money would be better used in helping to transport children to school <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not being in my place at the start of this report stage <e> <s> i should very much like to support the amendment put down by the noble lord lord reigate <e> <s> it is rather similar to the one that my noble friend lord donaldson of kingsbridge and myself put down in committee but it is rather tighter and neater <e> <s> it seems to cover various points made in committee <e> <s> the important aspect is that it explains what it is a memorial for <e> <s> it is practical enough to realise that when it comes to working the fund one is not going to be able to use this long title all the time <e> <s> it seems to me to be admirable and in view of what the minister has said i hope that we are going to have a happy concensus on this and that this amendment will be part of what i hope will soon be a statute <e>", "<cs> my lords i was waiting to hear what the noble lord the minister had to say in reply to the quite strong feeling expressed in the house <e> <s> i take his point very well first that consultation with the prime minister is <e>", "<cs> my lords as the amendment has not yet been withdrawn i should like a firm assurance from the noble lord in view of his refusal to accept this that the archaeological interest will go into the guidelines to the trustees and be drawn to the attention of their potential clients so that as far as possible there is no chance of some archeological object of great value to the heritage being missed because the word archaeological does not appear on the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords all i would say very briefly is thank you very much <e>", "<cs> my lords since my noble friend lord donaldson and i felt very strongly about this particular amendment which now enables the trustees to make loans as well as grants i think this is a tremendous improvement and i am very grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is rather a pity that the government will not accept that there could be some circumstances in which the trustees could be landed in a situation where it was vital for them to hold the property even for a short time <e> <s> i cannot imagine that the trustees and i accept that it is not their job would buy up property in the form of land or objects and hold on to it for even a short period <e> <s> however there is an outside chance and those of us who would like to see this provision inserted in the bill in some way feel that the amendment would take care of the odd eventuality instead of shutting the door completely <e> <s> i do not know whether the government would be prepared to look at the matter again <e>", "<cs> my lords in asking the minister a question may i say how delighted i was that he did not agree that there as an excessive burden at this stage because i believe this matter has been greatly exaggerated <e> <s> does he not agree that the greater london council offered hillingdon extra housing which it did not take up <e> <s> secondly does he not agree that in the recent case of the ethiopian woman and her child which has led to a great deal of publicity the court found that they were completely homeless without any other place of residence at all and they would presumably have had to be housed in some way by any local authority <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment to which i have put my name moved by my noble friend lord gibson for all the reasons which he drew out <e> <s> particularly i would like to associate myself with the remarks he made about museums <e> <s> the bill is extremely good in covering this point in part ii and clause is something which we welcome very much indeed <e> <s> but it is true that the point is not covered in part i it would make a very good balance if the government would accept this amendment and i hope the minister will <e> <s> in the unfortunate event of his not accepting it i should like to have firm assurances that the trustees will be given guidance on the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for moving this amendment because it is very much what we wanted <e> <s> it is a tremendous improvement and it covers a great deal of the ground that we have been concerned with regarding the significant associations of objects or collections with a particular place <e> <s> therefore i welcome it with great gratitude <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to hear the ministers assurances and his promise to enforce this by the beginning of april <e> <s> if by any unhappy unlikely and unfortunate chance not to do with your lordships house there is any delay do i assume that the interest on the capital will be paid <e> <s> this amounts to about a month and it would be disastrous if the fund did not get this right from the beginning <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened very carefully to what everybody has said including the noble lord the minister <e> <s> i am very sorry that the amendment has got this rather dusty reception <e> <s> i thought it was rather ingenious and i certainly hoped that it would be acceptable <e> <s> i do not think that there is any point <e>", "<cs> my lords i moved the amendmentit is mine and it has not been withdrawn <e> <s> i think i am in order and i shall go on until i am proved to be out of order <e> <s> as the minister has said the principle contained in this amendment has now been voted on several times <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend lord donaldson of kingsbridge that the tramp of the heavy feet of those who had not used their ears but who would march through the division lobby would make it a rather wasteful exercise <e> <s> therefore i shall with leave withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in supporting the amendment of my noble friend lord mishcon may i say that the noble lord lord belstead argued against the publication amendments saying that these were covered anyhow <e> <s> it sounded a complicated way <e> <s> i could not see then why it should not be clarified in the way these amendments clarify it <e> <s> the noble lord spoke of the local authority not making public their intention because it might worry people but if rumours are going round anyhow people are going to hear about it <e> <s> the local authority is not going to be able to keep this quiet <e> <s> in any case i cannot see why it should not report on the adequacy of the schools in the area when making changes and when we are talking about preventing local authorities from reducing the pro <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for that very full and courteous reply <e> <s> do not intend to press the amendments now <e> <s> i should like to have the opportunity to read carefully what the noble lord has said and decide between now and report stage what action to take <e> <s> i beg to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i agree that that explanation goes some way to meet these amendments and i do not think that we should pursue the matter further at this stage <e> <s> i thank the noble lord for his reply and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord <e> <s> if amendment no <e> <s> were carried then we would lose the reference to the secretary of state so it would need to be put in <e> <s> in view of what the noble lord has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i also find myself in a dilemma here <e> <s> being eminently reasonable i find that i like parts of the amendments in the name of the noble lord lord mowbray and stourton and parts of the amendments in the name of the noble lord lord reigate <e> <s> there have been occasions when i have been very ready to criticise the drafting of officials <e> <s> we had the report stage of this bill last monday and tuesday and at the end of that stage it was not altogether clear quite what had been accepted or what was happening <e> <s> the feeling or the house at that time was that first and foremost members wanted what is in the bill what it is a memorial for and about <e>", "<cs> my lords i am inclined to agree with the last speakers over this <e> <s> i can see how the problem has arisen because in this case the minister for the arts is the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster <e> <s> this is explained in clause but by spelling out earlier in the bill the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster it seems to me that one is building that into a statute <e> <s> i think that this is rather strange <e> <s> this is nothing to do with the present incumbent of that office personally but there is no reason for us to believe that this situation going on in perpetuity or that it will always be the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster <e> <s> one day there may be a secretary of state for the arts or it may be decided to rearrange the whole order of ministers who have responsibility for the arts and the heritage <e>", "<cs> my lords unless i have missed it it seems that nowhere does the bill say that the secretary of state referred to is the secretary of state for the environment it simply refers to the secretary of state and there are lots of them <e> <s> then in clause it defines the duties of <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to press the noble lord unnecessarily but if as he says it is spelt out and i am sorry to be stupid about it may i ask him to bring to my attention where it is spelt out <e> <s> i am informed by some of my noble friends that they too are unable to find it <e> <s> i cannot find any reference to the secretary of state for the environment <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a happy day for the heritage field and for those of us who feel very strongly about it <e> <s> i find it impossible for my mind not to go back several years to the events at the time of mentmore and as we know it was then that there started this whole chapter which has culminated in the bill receiving its third reading and being passed here today and i hope that it will remain as it is when it goes back to the commons <e> <s> if we take our minds back to those years we can recall all the turmoil about mentmore and the national land <e>", "<cs> my lords this afternoon we are taking a second bite at this bitter cherry <e> <s> when we debated it on th december the majority of speakers spoke strongly against the draft rules and of those who spoke and there were not many from the government benches almost all had some doubts about different aspects <e> <s> indeed at the end the noble lord lord belstead replying to the debate at column of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i read with great interest the <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret the minister has been unable to meet us on this <e> <s> the arguments for the amendment have been quite unassailable and i must therefore press the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the assurance which the minister has given in reply to both the question i raised and the amendment moved and in view also of her answer to the noble viscount lord eccles who was pursuing the same path i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords although we are pleased that the amendments passed by this house have been accepted by another place a point has been raised which gives rise to some concern <e> <s> just now the noble lord said that the monies cannot he paid into the fund until the chairman and the trustees have been appointed and that that matter has been delayed <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i ask the noble lord whether he would perhaps add to what he said <e> <s> he said that the money cannot be received until there is someone who can legally receive it <e> <s> i accept that <e> <s> but i am concerned about the situation as it accumulates which it would and this has been explained by the noble lord lord reigate and by my noble friend lord donaldson <e> <s> can we be assured <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for explaining so carefully why the government are revoking this order <e> <s> i thought that the <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i point out to him that he did not answer one at least of my questions <e> <s> i have given my notes to <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank the noble lord lord cullen <e>", "<cs> my lords following on the last remark of the noble lord about the service being cheap i wonder whether he can give me if not now perhaps later an estimate of the cost of installing meters and also the cost of the meter reading service and having regard to the governments pledges to cut down public expenditure tell me how many extra officials would be involved <e> <s> as water is a highly capital intensive industry would he not agree that the high interest rates are keeping the costs even higher <e> <s> if this proposal is followed through with separate meters in separate houses would he not also agree that it could be a tax on low-income large families and in fact be a disincentive to using water which is important for public health reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i could explain <e> <s> as the cost of providing reservoirs and anything to do with water is extremely expensive the high interest rates which we have at the moment make those costs even higher <e> <s> the point i was trying to make is that the government would be better advised to reduce interest rates than to put meters in every home which will prove outrageously expensive <e>", "<cs> my lords while the noble lord is perhaps taking the opportunity to cast back his mind or find the information about the disposal of goods <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the local authorities are not achieving these cuts and that in fact the majority of them are conservative controlled <e> <s> does he further agree that since presumably conservative councils are anxious to support government policy this must indicate that cuts of the order demanded by the government cannot be obtained only by streamlining administration but must be made at the expense of crippling crucial services on which in the words of the secretary of state in scarborough last september the framework of our society depends <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord saying that at no point will central government give an indication of <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness who has just spoken at least broke the chain of attitude as far as lord aveburys bill is concerned because there seemed to be almost complete agreement certainly up to a certain point about it <e> <s> she asked the minister how often people should be sent to prison for prostitution <e> <s> my noble friend lord donaldson explained that prostitution is not an offence <e> <s> i can tell the noble baroness and save the noble lord lord belstead from doing so that loitering and soliciting are the offences and there is a maximum penalty of <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has made the point for me <e> <s> it is a fair point but i do not like the idea of the statutory woman <e> <s> let me say there <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord very much for what he has said <e> <s> i had heard about it somebody did tell me what went on <e> <s> i must put it to him that this again is going backwards and just making a guess at what is going to happen <e> <s> once you have done that and emptied the streets it is very unlikely that the same thing will happen again <e> <s> it is proved by what the noble lord has said and the figures we have from the home office that the numbers of people who have been in prison are really very very small otherwise there would be more people being imprisoned <e> <s> the courts are not imprisoning people but prostitution is still going on though it is going on in a different way <e> <s> it is going on if you like in a more comfortable way off the streets through call girls and in all sorts of ways <e> <s> that is the pattern today <e>", "<cs> my lords this complex and highly indigestible measure on which we were engaged before the statement intervened was carefully explored by the minister in his outline of the governments housing plans and their philosophy <e> <s> the context in which it is set and in which it has to be looked at is britains critical housing crisis <e> <s> i shall not pretend that it is all the fault of the present government nevertheless the picture is dark and dense <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may briefly interrupt the noble lord as we are running so late <e> <s> it is not a blanket prejudice against the landlords <e> <s> he is talking about the shorthold section and we were saying that the safeguards which in fact were introduced by a conservative member in another place have not yet been honoured <e> <s> that is what we were speaking about <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord will give way <e>", "<cs> yes my lords otherwise we shall be past the point of no return which perhaps is the noble lords purpose <e> <s> the minister said that he had experience of leeds where there is a social spread in terms of property sold <e> <s> very well the noble lord has his figures <e>", "<cs> never mind <e>", "<cs> my lords if the rent officers are to make their own individual decisions what is the purpose of having statistical information relating to the levels of rents and property values for other areas <e> <s> why do they not have their own individual ones <e> <s> may i ask the minister whether he can make these notes which are sent out available in the libraries of both houses of parliament so that we ourselves can judge them <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to thank the noble lord for his clear exposition of what this bill is about and for his courtesy in writing to me about it in advance <e> <s> as we are aware this bill was originally part of an enormous local government bill and among other areas like the enterprise zones and urban development it was rather peeled off in layers and now comes to us bit by bit <e> <s> i have only a few points to make on the bill <e> <s> first i should like to say something on the increase in finance to which the noble lord referred an increase i understand of million which is supposed to last until the end of <e> <s> when the noble lord gave his shopping list it seemed rather long to me for that amount of money taking account of inflation and the present economic situation and although money is tight as we all appreciate it seems that a great many of the roads sewers and developments to which the noble lord referred may have to go by the board <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord saying that hundreds of thousands of houses are going to come up for renting not for sale <e> <s> are they coming on to the market for renting <e> <s> that is certainly not the impression i get from the chairmen of the new towns i have spoken to nor indeed from many conservatives who are concerned with new towns <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i could interrupt again while the <e>", "<cs> my lords before we embark upon the committee stage of the bill i should like to point out that this is an extremely long and complex bill and i feel that the government should have made available notes on clauses <e> <s> during the time that i was a minister in the department of the environment i took through this house about a dozen bills and to the best of my knowledge on all occasions i provided notes on clauses as the colleague of the noble baroness lady young will vouch for <e> <s> she was <e>", "<cs> we cannot hear what the noble lord is saying <e> <s> i do not know whether the microphone has moved or what has happened but we cannot hear a word of what is i am sure a very valuable contribution <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord evans of claughton <e> <s> he covered the ground extremely well and fully <e> <s> i should like to add that this part of the bill not only gives people an automatic right to buy in fact the local authority must sell but in addition large discounts are being allowed <e> <s> as the bill stands there are options of which last for two years which means that a house can be bought at the price ruling when the option was originally taken up <e> <s> in consequence a local authority will be <e>", "<cs> i was both amused and saddened on hearing the minister talk about the mixed social content <e> <s> he cannot be as naive as he appears and in fact i know he is not <e> <s> he says that this narrows the scope considerably and he refers to mobility <e> <s> i should like to put two points <e> <s> first it is quite inconsistent for the government to allow people the right to buy irrespective of any residential qualification drawn in this way when they are allowing local authorities to impose residential qualifications for council home allocations <e> <s> secondly he mentioned the question of mobility <e> <s> as it stands i think the bill will have the effect of discouraging mobility as the local authorities are likely to be very reluctant to accept tenants under the mobility scheme if as the noble lord lord evans said those tenants are then able immediately to claim <e>", "<cs> clause of this bill which is really the core of the bill marks a definitive break with past practice since for the first time the decisions about whether or not to sell to sitting tenants how many units and which type of housing for sale will be removed completely from the sphere of local authority discretion <e> <s> this policy runs directly counter to the increasing emphasis in recent years on the need to develop coherent local council housing strategies will inflict significant damage to the public sector adversely affect the housing aspirations of those who continue to look to the local authority for rented housing and will multiply the pressures on local authorities pressures that have already been heightened by the governments plans to halve expenditure on housing by / from million in / to million in / a massive cut of per cent <e> <s> which will put an end to new building cut down improvements and force up rents <e> <s> the other day at the housing consultative council mr john morgan chairman of the association of district councils said that the governments housing cuts could not be met without i quote this was reported in <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e> <s> i should like to get this point clear right from the beginning <e> <s> i am not saying nor have i ever said that everything done by the government of which was a member or by any other previous government was absolutely <e>", "<cs> this i think is probably one of the most important amendments we shall be dealing with at any rate today <e> <s> there is a very great problem here <e> <s> on second reading the minister said <e>", "<cs> my name is joined to this amendment with the noble lord lord hylton and the right reverend prelate <e> <s> the noble lord lord bellwin was talking about old people having the right to buy their own homes <e> <s> this amendment does not preclude that it says specifically that it covers only those dwelling-houses <e>", "<cs> there is not much for me to add to the careful explanation which the noble lord lord hylton gave of the amendment to which i attached my name <e> <s> i see this as a way to stop the erosion of houses in rural areas particularly where there are small communities and village life <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for the nice things he said about my heart but when he referred to the lack of commonsense in the amendment he seemed to have doubts about my head <e> <s> nevertheless i thank him very much <e> <s> i wish i had as much confidence as he has concerning the way the penalties are invoked and what happens to listed buildings in conservation areas <e> <s> life is not as simple as that <e> <s> in spite of these penalties very often the building gets treated badly <e>", "<cs> i think the minister really must accept that the fact that one does not agree with him all the time does not mean that one does not understand what is proposed <e> <s> we understand perfectly well what the government are doing but we do not happen to agree with certain aspects of it in fact with a lot of it <e> <s> there are particular aspects which we are dealing with tonight first the elderly and now those living in rural areas <e> <s> in view of what the minister has said i do not know what attitude he is going to take on the amendments which have been attached to clause but from the sound of his voice and the vigour of his words i have no hope therefore i intend to press this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am querying whether this is in order <e> <s> it seems to me to be a question-and-answer session between two noble lords <e> <s> i should have thought that any questions should be addressed to the minister <e> <s> we are now on schedule <e> <s> while it is interesting we are not here to discuss the activities of the adc <e>", "<cs> i put my name to this amendment in order to support the principle of the amendment of the noble lord lord hylton <e> <s> i also realised that the amendment itself was defective but it was a question of discussing the principle <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister could tell me why they have not thought about leases being made coterminous because of the management problems which arise when you have leases in one block of flats all ending at different times and the problem created when you want to <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may have an answer on my point about coterminous leases as well <e>", "<cs> i listened to what the minister said in answer to the noble <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that there is quite a lot of feeling in different <e>", "<cs> i may be wrong but i get the feeling both from what the minister said to his noble friend and from what he said in reply that he is not quite as happy about this provision as he is about some of the other proposals in this bill <e> <s> i should like to support the noble lord lord hylton <e> <s> i think his amendment as i believe the minister mentioned at one point is probably defective because i do not think he needs <e>", "<cs> i thought that my noble friend lady david clearly explained this amendment <e> <s> this is not a matter of principle at all <e> <s> it is a matter of our believing that it does the job that the government have said they want their amendment to do but it ties it even more <e>", "<cs> this is all so complicated <e> <s> it seems to me that that wording has nothing to do with the other amendment but i am sure that it must be so and i accept that <e> <s> speaking on this with the leave of the committee i shall speak to amendment no <e> <s> because i am not quite sure what amendment no <e> <s> means <e> <s> the point of amendment no <e> <s> is to reduce the time that the option can be held from two years to six months <e> <s> this really does more than any of the amendments even amendment no <e> <s> with its amendment to make sure that an option is granted only in order to help people over a very short bridging period <e> <s> in those circumstances it could be argued that an option was just about feasible because it would take about six months for people to organise themselves for the conveyance to be carried out and for everything to be done to enable the purchase to go forward <e>", "<cs> the minister said just now that the object was to make the bill as clear as it could be <e> <s> he could have fooled me <e> <s> i thought the object must be the reverse <e> <s> it is so obscure and its density is so great <e> <s> we now have a situation in which those of us on this side of the committee and i suspect that this applies to other members of the committee as well feel very strongly about the principle of the option scheme <e>", "<cs> like the noble lord lord evans i personally preferred amendments nos <e> <s> and which were unfortunately lost when we voted on them last thursday <e> <s> i think however that this amendment although it may have certain defects is something that the government should look at <e> <s> i would hope perhaps not very hopefully that the government would take it back to look at it <e>", "<cs> at least the noble lord did not say it was the labour party at its best so we must be thankful for small mercies <e> <s> we are all at our worst sometimes and the labour party does have its bad moments <e> <s> of course the noble lord is right the extraordinary thing running right through the bill is this almost authoritarian line from the centre from a party which all the time has been arguing certainly during the period of the labour government about the autonomy of the local authority <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e> <s> we on this side of the committee have been trying to keep the debate short but this is a different point <e> <s> it is important that it should come before parliament but this is an entirely different point from local involvement <e> <s> i am asking the minister how the local involvement is going to come about <e> <s> i want to know how it is going to work in practice not how theoretically the local authority can take the initiative <e> <s> it is quite right that the local authorities should sometimes take the initiative <e> <s> i am asking that <e> <s> the one thing does not exclude the other <e> <s> these are not mutually exclusive things <e>", "<cs> i do not want to carry on the debate too long perhaps the minister can write to me or come back and i will withdraw the amendment and wait for report <e> <s> i am asking at which point is the local authority brought in <e> <s> the noble lord said that the secretary of state will make the order and the noble lord lord beaumont took up the point about consistency <e> <s> i want to know how far the involvement of the local authority <e>", "<cs> hoping that in the meantime we shall get some light and taking into account the various questions that have been asked by my noble friends since i last spoke i shall for the time being beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as the minister has said that i will withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the minister will be surprised to hear that i consider the government have got it right this time <e> <s> it follows very much the lines of the rent agriculture act which although it gave rise to misgivings in advance in the end worked out very well <e> <s> i think that it should be left as it is and i hope the noble viscount will withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> very briefly because it is very late i want to support the noble lord lord evans in his amendment because i also feel very strongly about this matter for the reasons he has explained <e> <s> i feel that by all means one should try to persuade to make available attractive alternative accommodation but if at the end of the day the person i do not think there can be very many such persons says no i want to remain where i am then i think it really becomes very inhuman and uncompassionate if one does not accede to their wish <e>", "<cs> i am not taking this to a vote tonight it would be ridiculous at this hour <e> <s> but i am not going to negative it otherwise i cannot bring it back on report <e> <s> however i really am desperately disappointed that the government should follow this line <e> <s> the argument put forward by the noble lord that it would upset other tenants who pay their rent could be taken in aid of all sorts of savage punishments for all sorts of things because other people do not commit the same crimes <e> <s> i do not think that is the approach which we should adopt <e> <s> we have heard and i have also said that fewer than one third of local authorities use this particularly savage and i think quite barbarian measure <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> we start on a rather happy note <e> <s> i am pleased to welcome the governments amendment <e> <s> i hope that this is going to be one of many concessions that we shall be seeing during the afternoon and evening <e>", "<cs> i shall restrict myself at the moment entirely to this amendment <e> <s> in view of what the minister has said although i think we have gone rather <e>", "<cs> we are dealing with the whole basis of this part of the bill <e>", "<cs> there are just a few points i should like to make on what the minister has said <e> <s> i am sure i heard him refer to nostalgia for long <e>", "<cs> with respect i did not say within one year i said after one year <e> <s> after all it is more than likely when a landlord can let for a maximum of five years to a minimum of one year that he will opt for the shorter period <e> <s> he would be less than human if he did not and he could then see how things worked out <e> <s> of course he may want to sell the property <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for all he has said <e> <s> i listened carefully to his remarks and to the comments of other noble lords <e> <s> i have not heard from the minister a convincing reason why this change in review and phasing should take place at this time and certainly there has been no answer to the points raised by myself and by the noble lord lord goodman <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord knows i had tabled an amendment to this clause in which i was trying to find a way to minimise the effects on the tenant if rents were decontrolled <e> <s> it was extremely difficult to do this but i think my amendment went some way towards it <e> <s> however i thought on balance that leaving out the clause as suggested by the noble lord lord goodman was a much better way of dealing with this situation which he rightly said is really such a small part of all the housing problems in this country <e>", "<cs> at present the whole thing is completely wide open and by restricting it to a <e>", "<cs> holiday lettings are not registered <e> <s> as we have discussed during the passage of the bill the rent of shorthold lettings are registered so there is that difference and there would still be a big advantage in having a holiday letting licence <e>", "<cs> in view of what the minister has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> speaking as a spokesman for her majestys opposition in your lordships house i certainly would not oppose the new clause which has been moved by the noble earl <e> <s> i was touched by his romantic story of love and property which added to his persuasive powers in support of this clause <e>", "<cs> i should like to look very carefully at what the minister has said and also to refresh myself as to what we did when in government <e> <s> therefore i will withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the minister for that explanation because it was very difficult just reading the amendment without any explanatory notes to understand the very important content of it <e> <s> subject to my not finding anything displeasing when i read in <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the minister and the government very much for introducing this clause which both we on this side of the house and my honourable friends in another place very much wanted to have inserted in the bill <e>", "<cs> while i do not doubt that what the noble lord said about the last amendment was so and the rest of the clause and i am not rubbing it in for political reasons this does underline the need for us to have notes on clauses on this bill <e> <s> it is terribly difficult to take in what it is about <e> <s> the amendment as it stands almost means nothing unless one is provided with further information on the clause itself as well <e> <s> although we agreed to it simply in order to expedite <e>", "<cs> and any of the other rather obscure amendments because it is very difficult to understand them <e> <s> it is one of these occasions where you do not really know what to ask for <e> <s> you do not know what you want to know until you know what you do not know <e>", "<cs> whether or not it is for the nth time unless everybody is satisfied that everybody is reasonably housed in this country and that there is not a waiting list how on earth can one talk about not replacing housing stock <e> <s> we do not want surplus housing stock but unless people have a home it does not make sense <e> <s> i do not expect the noble lord necessarily to answer that point now <e> <s> he can answer it after my noble friend has replied <e>", "<cs> i do not know precisely what happened but i think my noble friend deserves an apology <e>", "<cs> in adding a brief word to what has been said may i take the opportunity to wish the noble baroness lady ryder of warsaw a happy birthday today <e> <s> i should like to add my support and that of my noble friends to what has been said by the noble baroness lady vickers by the other noble lords who have spoken and by the right reverend prelate <e> <s> may i say that this is one of the rare occasions when an amendment is supported by every side of the committee including the bishops <e> <s> the liberals have their name to it we are supporting it the cross-benches have added their support it has the support of everybody <e>", "<cs> the noble lord says that if the figure is high everyone will use it <e> <s> but according to the subsection the contributory element has to be so much of the amount determined under section <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness replies and decides on what she wants to do may i say that whatever she decides to do we will go along with her <e> <s> i should like to make one point for consideration when it is taken back <e> <s> one clause allows the secretary of state discretion <e> <s> if we take the amount which is being asked for which i believe is and consider the cost of an application in exceptional cases and the cost of processing this through the department i think several hundred pounds would already have gone for each case before the money reached the applicant <e>", "<cs> bearing in mind that there is about to be correspondence between my noble friend and the minister and in view of the ministers assurance <e>", "<cs> with respect i think that the noble lord lord evans should <e>", "<cs> may i add my welcome to this amendment to show that we do appreciate some of the good things when they are occasionally put before us <e>", "<cs> when the noble lord says that many people will find the delay incomprehensible i would reply by suggesting that many more will find many parts of the bill completely incomprehensible <e> <s> nevertheless the reply did not surprise me and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords first we should like to know for what purpose the metropolitan police are to redevelop the old hospital <e> <s> secondly bearing in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords when the government offered to take the matter away the noble lord lord hylton raised the point if he had not i should have done so myself as to whether it should be taken back otherwise at that time there would have been a vote upon what was a wider amendment than this <e> <s> all the amendments were taken back <e> <s> there was no decision at that time that we had moved into the position that the noble lord is talking about now <e>", "<cs> my lords i must ask the minister to give way <e> <s> he seems to have forgotten that the amendment says that the houses have to be specially designed and adapted <e> <s> that is the whole point <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the time has come to round up the debate as the minister has now answered <e> <s> only want to take about one minute to say first that what i am going to ask the house to vote on is my amendment which refers to specially designed specially adapted houses which by the does own figures refers to about people <e> <s> i am very grateful to all those who have spoken in support of it but whether they went wider than the amendment is not relevant at this point <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the reply is very satisfactory and i think that my noble friend lord pargiter made a very good point <e> <s> however i do not propose to press my luck on this so i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have my name to the amendment of the noble lord lord monson because i felt as he did that it was a quite anomalous situation and that in addition it would make great difficulties for the management and maintenance of flats particularly the communal part <e> <s> i am afraid that i have only just seen the supplementary marshalled list but if this covers the points raised by the noble lord and if he is satisfied then i am happy as well <e>", "<cs> my lords these are complicated and technical amendments except for lawyers <e> <s> even though the minister explained them i am sure with clarity may i ask if it means that under amendment no <e> <s> the period is or is not taken into account <e> <s> in other words if a man dies and his wife then becomes the tenant and she has lived in the house with him jointly for a number of years does that count towards her residence for the right to buy and towards the discount time <e> <s>

the government department replies and everything is sorted out <e> <s> we have to be realistic <e> <s> we all know that these things take time <e> <s> they will take even longer if we get as we are getting now cuts in central government expenditure <e> <s> therefore it will he understandable if things are further delayed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am really not very happy about that <e> <s> the minister gave the analogy of my buying a house and how i would feel about the costs <e> <s> if i bought a house that i had been living in for years and got per cent <e> <s> discount and if in addition i had also had the option i do not think i would mind very much about paying my share of the costs <e> <s> but this is not the point <e> <s> the point is that that would be so if i were living as a council tenant and bought that house because i would then be in the public sector area and be involved and the people who would be helping to defray my costs would be ratepayers and taxpayers so that is entirely different <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise because recollection has suddenly come to me <e> <s> i think the noble lord will understand he is always sympathetic <e> <s> we have had such a shoal of letters from the department <e> <s> the words administrative steps strike a bell and i have a <e>", "<cs> my lords i did say amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the amendments are nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> the purpose of these amendments is to give security of tenure to those in tied accommodation but also to allow their eviction where the tenant is no longer in the employment of the landlord and the dwelling-house is needed for another incoming worker <e> <s> in addition amendment no <e> <s> provides that if a tied tenant has had two years continuous employment he is entitled to alternative accommodation <e> <s> in contrast the governments approach in amendment no <e> <s> is further to exempt from any security of tenure those occupying accommodation in schools or social service facilities where that accommodation is linked to employment <e> <s> i shall come back to that point in a moment <e> <s> it is not that i am opposed to the governments amendments but to me the missing link is that there is no provision for alternative accommodation when the tenant loses the tied accommodation <e>", "<cs> i agree that i said when moving my amendment that they were very complicated and i think the position is very difficult <e> <s> if i may say so on the assumption that the noble lord has not sat down there seems to be some misunderstanding because under the act i am talking about the rent agriculture act through it is true the operation of the a dhacs i f your lordships remember the local authorities had to use every reasonable endeavour to try to find alternative accommodation <e> <s> in fact that is working out very well so there seems to have been rather a mistake over that <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the noble baroness lady faithfull is satisfied with the ministers reply <e> <s> it did not seem to me as the amendments are drafted that they take in all the organisations she mentioned <e> <s> it is difficult to ask a question of the minister through the noble baroness <e> <s> i should like to get that straight before i continue with my winding up <e>", "<cs> it is not all quite well <e> <s> there are the amendments i moved and the noble lord asked me how they fitted in <e> <s> if i can be brief i recognise absolutely the difficulty which the government amendments seek to relieve <e> <s> i believe the relaxation of security should only operate in relation to tenancies created before the commencement of the act <e> <s> tenancies of this kind should be subject to security thus deterring local authorities from creating unnecessary tied housing <e> <s> the minister made the point clearly in the committee on th june in columns to when he said that the authority should consider carefully before creating such accommodation and the relaxation <e>", "<cs> with leave my lords i will say that in that case i will study <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very concerned about this amendment and i cannot say that i am very happy at the ministers reply <e> <s> unfortunately this situation is something of which we have all been aware for a long time <e> <s> whichever government are in power it is terrible to see houses boarded up longer and longer waiting lists and either squatters getting in or nobody being able to use a property <e> <s> in the past there has been some use made of shortlife property <e> <s> the glc have done a great deal in that field particularly <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i was not blaming local authorities <e> <s> i was saying that if left unchanged the situation would put local authorities in this extremely difficult and anomalous situation <e> <s> i was not saying that they would behave maliciously but that they would feel that they had no alternative <e> <s> i want the amendment because i want to give local authorities a feeling of security in which they can go ahead and let this property on short tenancies <e> <s> it was for that reason that i very much hoped the government would accept the amendment <e> <s> i do not want to press it but if the government do not feel that they can accept the amendment then i must do so <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me that on the whole the minister was talking about not decontrolling but leaving the whole control system as it is which was in fact the amendment we debated in committee <e> <s> this really is quite different <e> <s> on this amendment i am not arguing that there should not be decontrol <e> <s> what i am saying is that where properties do not come up to what is really a very low standard of fitness for human habitation they should not at that point be decontrolled <e> <s> this does not mean those properties which fit the criteria they can be <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i would point out that it is still subject to the property being <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to take noble lords on that long long walk as regards this amendment <e> <s> however i should like to feel and i am sure that with the leave of the house the minister could nod to me that the minister will take this matter away and look at it in the same way as he promised as regards the previous amendment moved by my noble friend lord gifford <e> <s> i think that he recognises that there is a problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it is kensington and chelsea <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e>", "<cs> this amendment my lords is a case of very great overkill <e> <s> the case which hillingdon council have been making and on which the noble baroness lady faithfull and the noble lord lord mottistone base their amendment is simply not justified by the facts <e> <s> the numbers of people arriving homeless from overseas who are entitled to be in this country who have no accommodation elsewhere and who have not become homeless intentionally is very small <e> <s> a picture went through my mind of people sitting round the bush in africa saying how can we abuse the housing homeless <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i might ask the noble lord this <e> <s> can he indicate what sort of housing homeless people who arrive here or people of refugee status could have <e> <s> what are they going to do <e> <s> are they going into hotels <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend withdraws the amendment may i say this amendments nos <e> <s> and really go together but they have <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments were separated by a number of other amendments but from a discussion point of view it would have been better if they had been taken together <e> <s> when the minister answered the amendment moved by noble friend lord davies of leek amendment no <e> <s> my impression was that he was not going to have a look at the whole matter generally <e> <s> he did not say that he would necessarily come back on this bill but it was certainly a very much more flexible answer than the answer we have had on this amendment <e> <s> i said that i had spoken to it because i got up and said that they <e>", "<cs> my lords if that is so i shall withdraw the amendment and i suggest that the noble lord tears up what he said in answer just before <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the government very much <e> <s> i am very pleased that these amendments have been moved <e> <s> i think that this is a very great improvement <e> <s> it is extremely important that there should be affirmative resolution in this area and therefore it is something about which at the end of a long long two days and nights we can be pleased <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that when my noble friend is asking for direct encouragement she is asking for a little more than was contained in the replies given by the minister <e> <s> does he not agree that during this holiday when so many parents of the children are unemployed and when far fewer children can be taken away on holiday there is need for very specific facilities both to keep the children occupied during the holidays and to give them an alternative to going away on a real holiday <e>", "<cs> my lords before we go into the third reading i must raise with the house <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first apologise to the noble and learned lord on the woolsack for being so precipitate <e> <s> i have just heard from the other place that at question time the minister for housing has said that the government intend to reject the lords amendment excluding old peoples dwellings from the right to buy <e> <s> we have not yet had the third reading of the bill in this house <e> <s> the bill has not yet been passed and yet we have this behaviour on the part of the government in another place which is an absolute insult to this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not castigating another place <e> <s> i was castigating the government <e> <s> my source is a member of the front bench the shadow minister for housing for the opposition who sent me this note <e> <s> we have already asked whether it is so <e> <s> to say that we cannot castigate the government for behaving in this way is i would say with great respect absolute nonsense <e> <s> this bill has not been through this house <e> <s> it has not yet been finished in this house <e> <s> if the minister is asked a question there is a form of words that is not unknown which is it would be inappropriate for me to comment at this stage as the bill has not yet proceeded through the other place <e>", "<cs> my lords just before we vote i really must make a protest about what the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls said about this being a manoeuvre <e> <s> i think that is quite disgraceful <e> <s> what happened was exactly as we said <e> <s> in fact there was not even time for me to tell the noble lord lord bellwin as i would have done out of courtesy <e> <s> i had a note saying that john stanley had said at question time that the government intended to reject the lords amendment excluding old peoples dwellings from the right to buy <e> <s> it was on that that i proceeded <e> <s> i take very great exception to the noble lord saying that it was a manoeuvre <e> <s> i was absolutely prepared to come along with the third reading <e> <s> i ask the noble lord to have the courtesy and decency to withdraw but if he is not to withdraw i should rather not be subjected to another speech <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an anti-climax after all that we have been through <e> <s> i will take the ministers word for this <e> <s> i do not really follow every detail of it <e> <s> i gather it is partly drafting partly bridging and necessary to integrate the bill <e> <s> i think that would be correct <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i am concerned i find that amendment acceptable <e> <s> it helps to clarify the bill which needs a lot of clarification and it also helps people to understand what they are entitled to or concerned with <e>", "<cs> my lords i found it not only rather sad and frustrating but highly amusing that the minister in rejecting this amendment used such phrases as <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down may i say this <e> <s> i did not want to interrupt his flow <e> <s> he said that apart from the right to buy this is the fundamental conservative policy <e> <s> but that does not detract from the fact that it is taking away all autonomy from local authorities <e> <s> you cannot say except for that that local authorities have complete autonomy and flexibility <e> <s> i do not expect the minister to smile at that but i think i have made him smile more often than he gives me credit for <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened very carefully to what the minister said and a number of points struck me about this really quite small amendment <e> <s> apart from himself nobody has taken the side of the government as regards this amendment <e> <s> the government have had no support whatever <e> <s> however there has been support for the amendment from different parts of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that the ministers arguments are in the category of being very iffy if this or if not the amendment does not specify this that or the other <e> <s> that was on the practical side <e> <s> i would say only that if the governments heart and head were in the right place in regard to this matter it could all be worked out <e> <s> the minister has put up a great many obstacles saying that this and that are not included in the amendment and that this and that cannot be done <e> <s> anything can be done if one wants to do it <e> <s> if the government really wanted to accept the principle here then with all the talent at their disposal i see much of it assembled in the officials box they could bring forward an amendment to meet all the points and the obstacles that they have raised <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble lord lord evans of claughton in his amendment <e> <s> i was as i mentioned before minister in the department when the housing homeless persons bill went through <e> <s> i remember making the point during the passage of the bill that the number of intentionally homeless was not expected to be large <e> <s> however as was not to be unexpected some local authorities have interpreted this provision in a much wider manner than was envisaged indeed there has been a recent court case on it which i will not go into now because we have discussed it before and classify as intentionally homeless people who took short-term holiday lettings and were subsequently evicted and made homeless <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord evans that it must be made clear that people who do take shorthold lettings cannot subsequently be judged intentionally homeless and refused permanent housing by a vocal authority solely on the grounds that they have taken a shorthold letting <e> <s> i should have thought that the government would welcome this amendment because it protects people who wish to take a short-hold tenancy but may be rather worried and deterred from doing so because they fear that at the end of their tenancy they will be refused housing by the local authority <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say two or three words in support of the amendment <e> <s> i can see some of the difficulties which have been raised by the government when they have been opposing it in the past but i think the noble viscount has put his finger on what is likely to be a very great problem and the fact that it may be small in dimension does not make the situation any better for those who are going to suffer from it <e> <s> if it means as i understand and the case put forward by the noble viscount seems to me to be a very strong one that in fact the charities which deal with for instance either battered wives or single-parent families are going to find that they are not able to turn over their clientele which is really the only way they can work with limited resources both financial and as far as property is concerned then obviously it is going to be a very grave situation and to be able to go to the court as the noble viscount pointed out is not very much help when time and money is involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i see the point that the minister has made <e> <s> i was aware of what is in clause but it seems to me that it would be better to include it here as well so that the position is beyond doubt <e> <s> i cannot see any objection to putting it in if as the minister says one is really underlining and repeating something that is elsewhere in the bill <e> <s> we are now dealing with schedule and one might not want to turn to one of the other parts of the bill when one seems to be spending half of ones life reading this housing bill <e> <s> i should have thought this was something which could be easily accepted in order to make the position clear <e> <s> if the minister has a real objection perhaps he can explain to me what it is <e> <s> he has explained that this is covered to some extent but it obviously is not covered here in schedule because it does not read in that way <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to start by thanking the minister the noble lord lord bellwin for the very nice things he said about me personally and also about my colleagues <e> <s> i should like <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a very happy day for the lords and between ourselves i am feeling very happy too <e> <s> i think we are celebrating the collective good sense of this house because all the way through the debate on this very long and complicated bill from second reading until today the concern about the elderly cut right across party lines <e> <s> it really is a great pity that the government were so obdurate for so long and it was really their own fault that their conversion came so late but at least it came and we welcome it <e> <s> in saying this i certainly do not blame the noble lord lord bellwin who i should like to think as today i am feeling rather starry-eyed was secretly on the side of the angels <e> <s> if he was not do not tell me let me live with my illusions <e>", "<cs> what has happened is the result of the dedication to this of so many members of this house my noble friends behind me the liberals the cross-benchers and indeed many members sitting opposite who while they may have believed as i am sure they do believe in the governments bill and in their manifesto promises on the right to buy felt strongly enough about this particular exclusion to support us <e> <s> therefore it is with great pleasure that i accept the amendment as moved in the commons <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not insist on the amendment and i put the ministers mind at rest about that <e> <s> but i must just comment on this amendment <e> <s> again i shall not rehearse all the arguments that we have gone through but the amendment which was introduced into this house on report was quite different from any of the other amendments that were moved in regard to the option <e> <s> the minister was quite right when he said <e>", "<cs> my lords i personally disagree with it enormously but again i am not going to press my disagreement <e> <s> i disagree with the reason that it would be inappropriate for orders to be made by local authorities rather than by the secretary of state <e> <s> our amendment however says the local <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to insist on this amendment but i cannot let the opportunity go by without again registering my feeling about this whole clause and the fact that the government have been so obstinate about quite a simple amendment <e> <s> all it does is ask the secretary of state to state his reasons <e> <s> i shall not rehearse all that i have said before and the minister has said in reply but it still seems to me to be important if the local authorities want to challenge what the secretary of state said in the courts then by having his reasons given in writing they have something to go on <e> <s> i feel that this is a case of extreme obstinacy <e> <s> it really is not a matter of principle but at this point there is obviously not going to be any way of pursuing it further <e>", "<cs> my lords following on from what the noble lord lord byers has said i should like to press the noble lord to answer the question of whether it would not be better to give every support to the camp david process and the camp david signatories since the united states israel and egypt have made it quite clear that they do not want a european intervention <e> <s> would it not be more productive to allow this process to continue without any further interference especially at a time when the situation in the gulf is as alarming as it is <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord middleton <e> <s> it is not very often that we see eye to eye on these matters but on this occasion particularly as far as subsections and are concerned i entirely agree with him and i think he is absolutely right <e> <s> one of the problems and i found this when i was a minister in the department where the noble lord the minister is now always was to get people to take care of the listed buildings and to use them and if in doing so they need planning permission to make it more comfortable or to enlarge them or to do some sort of work on them and they have to pay a charge for that permission i think this could act as a very strong <e>", "<cs> before the minister finishes i should like to ask a question <e> <s> he said that there will be no charges for listed buildings consent <e> <s> i am talking about where there is a planning application to incorporate the listed building in some form of development and not just listed buildings consent <e> <s> i have in mind the building which should be restored and held <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned only listed buildings consent <e> <s> can he expand on that <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt but i feel lost <e> <s> is the noble lord replying to the same amendment as the amendment that was moved <e>", "<cs> while i supported the noble lord lord middleton in his last amendment i find that i cannot in thus amendment <e> <s> i entirely agree with what the minister has said <e> <s> the proposal is lengthy complex and time-consuming and introduces procedures which are totally unnecessary <e> <s> the minister is absolutely right when he points out that although the intention of the noble lord lord middleton may have been different the protection to listed buildings would be far less than with spot listing and the present procedure <e> <s> it is perfectly true that spot listing is sometimes tripped up as it probably was over the firestone building <e> <s> with the present procedure however it is up to the secretary of state and not removed from him to a lands tribunal which is concerned with land values and not with listed buildings and protection and the definition of whether a building is of historic and architectural interest <e> <s> i am therefore glad that the government will not accept this amendment but will leave the procedures as they are at present <e>", "<cs> i think the minister made that very clear <e> <s> he did use the word consult which was originally in the amendment but the word is now notify which is rather different <e> <s> if we can be satisfied that the local amenity societies will be aware of this in their localities so that they do have the opportunity to make representations to local authorities obviously in the face of opposition from the government there is no point in pressing it certainly at this time of night <e> <s> i am glad the noble lord understood that what i was getting at was not that all these applications should go to the historic buildings council which would obviously be impossible but should be considered within the different localities <e> <s> as long as there are means by which they are made aware of this and know that these buildings are going to be tied up for five years without being able to be listed then one could see how that works and <e>", "<cs> as the minister is not accepting the amendment i can now say that it was probing in nature and what he said was what i was hoping to hear namely that the department is considering it and it is something that it has in mind <e> <s> i hope it will bring forward legislation when it has sorted out what i am the first to admit is an extremely difficult problem <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have my name down to this amendment and in order to shorten the proceedings i must try not to take part in the debate but i really must in view of what the noble lord lord drumalbyn has been saying and i know that certainly his past experience in the advertising field has been great <e> <s> i am afraid he has a lot of this quite wrong <e> <s> he has made the same mistake as there is in this glossy publication referred to by the noble baroness lady vickers <e> <s> mr michael shersby mp is reported as saying in <e>", "<cs> there is one point i should like to raise on the schedule and in doing so i wish to congratulate the government on the grants made and on outstanding conservation areas which is helpful to villages and in fact the whole conservation impact which goes through this bill <e> <s> on page at line the words used are contract for redevelopment and although it is extremely good that demolition will not now take place until as i understand it the contract is signed for new building i should like to get a clear statement from the minister that the contract for redevelopment means the last contract that was made and means the building contract <e> <s> if this is watertight in legal terms that is all i need to know <e>", "<cs> i should like to think that clause as it stands would be quite adequate in fact that it would be unnecessary for us in this day and age again to bring into any of these clauses the amendments which refer specifically to sex race or ethnic origins <e> <s> however unfortunately as the noble baroness lady seear pointed out quite clearly it is absolutely necessary <e> <s> when my noble friend lord aylestone referred to programme training and i shall not comment on it because i do not know enough about what is being done at the moment and that women should have the opportunity if they have the experience of programme control or programme production he was hitting at the nub of the problem <e> <s> the noble baroness was saying that women do not have the opportunity to reach the stage when they can take further opportunities of training <e> <s> i hope that the committee will come to some agreement as to the form of the structure but i also hope that the committee will agree to include either the words of my noble friend on the front bench or the words of the noble baroness lady seear which specifically spell out this point of equality of opportunity for women as well as men and for men as well as women <e> <s> the advantage of the amendment of the noble baroness over that of my noble friend is that she includes the ethnic and race origins <e>", "<cs> i would not put my toes into scottish waters unless i felt that this was something of such importance that it has much more even than a scottish dimension <e> <s> i moved the original amendment on report on the english bill which was accepted and passed by a majority of in this house <e> <s> among its supporters there were scottish peers conservatives liberals and independents <e> <s> as my noble friend lord ross explained so i shall not repeat it it then went to the house of commons <e> <s> after a certain amount of commotion a compromise was agreed and it then came back to this house <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble earl would write to me about that <e> <s> i find it very difficult to accept it <e> <s> there may be some misunderstanding about the figures but they just do not add up <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i thank the noble lord the minister for coming to the house to make the statement and also for responding to my noble friend lady llewelyn-davies who raised the point earlier today <e> <s> i must say right away that although the statement says that the announcement was not one which should be made in the form of a statement to parliament we all consider certainly my noble friends beside me and behind me that it is a matter so serious that it certainly should be stated to parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we have had from the minister an admission that the government are considering the abolition of the domestic rate and in the questions that followed both my noble friend lord davies of leek and the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter were really making the same sort of point from perhaps <e>", "<cs> my lords if with the leave of the house i may reply it is not quite the same amendment because this amendment is to delete the clause and i think i am right in saying that the amendment on committee was to alter the words <e> <s> if the noble lord lord beaumont thinks it is improper for the house to do this he is wrong <e> <s> this is something of such consequence and we have heard what the minister has now admitted so the answer is different from the previous answer that the house should have an opportunity to vote again <e> <s> it is put in a different way <e>", "<cs> my lords t will not pursue the routeing from airports referred to by the noble lord <e> <s> as far as i can see there always seem to be an enormous number of very ugly-looking advertisements on the way from heathrow <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord was having a snooze from heathrow and did not have one when he went to strasbourg <e> <s> my noble friends and i are very disappointed that the government have not seen fit to accept the original amendment or the amendment as it has been reworded which i think is even better than the one moved by the noble lord lord duncan-sandys at committee stage and supported by the <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord stewart put the case against the governments attempted repeal of the community land act so well and so succinctly that really there is not very much for me to say about it <e> <s> but as i was the minister in a labour government who introduced the bill into your lordships house i should like to take up one point made by the lord advocate <e> <s> he said the government had not approached the matter in any doctrinaire way <e> <s> when i introduced the bill in august his distinguished colleague the noble baroness lady young was the opposition spokesman on the environment <e> <s> she said right at the beginning of her speech after i had sat down and i quote from col of the <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the moratorium which was announced about a week ago on council building and which will also include private building and improvements do the government not think that certainly for the time being while this is going on there should be not increased encouragement for people to buy their houses together with the giving out of all these application forms and booklets but a drawing back because of the numbers of people who are on the waiting lists for houses and flats who will not get them and whose condi <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to follow this up but it is important <e> <s> with great respect i was asking the minister whether or not he agrees that it can make a difference because many people who are unable to buy their council houses because of the present pressure on council houses for rent will go and find them somewhere else <e> <s> if they buy them up it means that people in flats cannot be moved into houses with gardens <e> <s> this is exactly what is happening in all parts of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has moved the regulations with great clarity <e> <s> in reading the regulations themselves they are as is usual in these cases long in words and short on comprehension <e>", "<cs> my lords there is one point i should like to raise again if i may <e> <s> i did mention it but i should like an assurance that the minister is taking it on board <e> <s> it is the matter of the tenants being informed in simple language about their right to a consultation so that they know exactly what the position is and exactly what they do <e> <s> these are human points and points of communication <e> <s> the other point deals with what i think could create difficulties namely this request in writing <e> <s> i should like to feel that this is being taken up by the government and by the minister and that something will be done on both points <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the minister three brief questions <e> <s> as he has told us the orders are coming into effect shortly and bearing in mind the advertising campaign mounted by the government to promote the now even more untimely right to buy for council tenants will the government undertake to reassure tenants who may be confused by the introduction of short-hold that security of tenure for existing protected tenants is not being removed <e> <s> secondly are the government going to consult organisations which are expert in advising tenants on housing issues on the wording of the prescribed notice since these organisations have great expertise and experience in making themselves understood by people who are not familiar with officialese <e> <s> i understand that they have offered their help <e> <s> thirdly what plans have the government to monitor the use of shorthold tenancies and in particular any abuses which may occur <e>", "<cs> my lords what i was concerned with was the publicity put out by the government to explain to people in simple language and whether the government would be seeking the help of the voluntary housing organisations which have experience and expertise in dealing simply with these matters <e> <s> that is very important <e>", "<cs> well my lords that is the way it was understood by most people and i understand by some members of the cabinet as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i understood that perfectly well <e> <s> but i think it is rather difficult to put that sort of argument over to the pensioner who is at the receiving end of this <e> <s> it is a correct intellectual and economic argument but i think socially it is very wrong and very bad and extremely unfortunate <e> <s> finally the other day there was a leader i think in <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the amendment standing in my name <e>", "<cs> my lords since i understand that a number of prisoners are spending most of their days in police vans travelling between police stations because there is not sufficient room for them in police station cells may i ask the noble lord what arrangements will be made for them and whether it is the case that a number of prisoners are travelling around in very small confined cages within police vans <e>", "<cs> my lords the statement we have just heard on housing is a long and fairly complicated one but the overall message at this time just before christmas must be one of the gloomiest messages to be put out to the people of this country <e> <s> at a time when we are in the middle of a deep recession and when unemployment is going up daily we now have this absolutely depressing devastating and unnecessary cutback on housing <e>", "<cs> my lords while the minister is on this point may i say that never have council house rents been put up by an amount of over per cent <e> <s> which is a low estimate of what is happening today <e> <s> the minister cannot get round that <e>", "<cs> absolute nonsense <e>", "<cs> my lords what a wonderful country we live in <e> <s> i have been sitting here thinking how marvellous it is that we live in a country with so much freedom that we can spend so many hours expending so much passion as well on whether it is a great inroad on our personal liberty and freedom if we have to put on seat belts which may save our lives and the lives of other people <e> <s> it really is something that we should think about and it is rather cheering in the very difficult times in which we live at the moment <e> <s> when the noble viscount lord hanworth talked about this fascist-communist measure i thought things were a little out of proportion <e> <s> he very nobly at the end of his speech he did not divulge his reasons for what seemed to be a switch which it was an enchanting one said that he would be supporting the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister is referring to the cut in housing expenditure and the burden it is creating it certainly is not stopping under the tories <e> <s> i should like to ask two questions <e> <s> in view of the steep council house rent rises announced yesterday and the proposal to reduce housing expenditure from million in to million in can the minister say what is the governments future policy or if they are considering one on subsidies to council tenants <e> <s> secondly does not the minister feel that the rent increases and the consequential reduction in subsidies have gravely enlarged the inequality between the public and private sectors as tax relief on mortgages is running currently at roughly billion <e>", "<cs> my lords all i wish to ask the noble lord is first whether he agrees that the question is not irrelevant but is absolutely bang on as regards the original question asked by the noble lord lord hylton <e> <s> secondly will he accept that there is a considerable inequality of sacrifice let me put it that way between the tenants of the public sector and owner-occupiers in the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that in addition to increasing numbers in the probation service it is essential to increase the resources available to them such as hostels clinics and so on <e> <s> i find that in the court in which i sit lack of resources is a problem with which the probation service is faced <e> <s> does not the minister agree that to increase the numbers in the service without increasing the facilities and resources that they can use will not be of much help <e> <s> i think that this is a very important point <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this is possibly <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> i shall be very brief but i should like to intervene since he mentioned me and what had happened at the department <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that in a consultation paper was put out by the department <e> <s> that was after the present government came into office <e> <s> nevertheless conclusions reached differed considerably from what are contained in the regulations this evening <e> <s> it is true that there was an inclusive list but it certainly did not give the definition that is contained in these regulations nor was there any reference to danger to the health of a -year-old child <e> <s> so there has been a very considerable change <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may intervene <e> <s> i was using that only as an example of the main point <e> <s> the home authority the local authority whence it comes is not under an obligation here to be informed <e> <s> that is the problem <e> <s> it is not a question of whether these happen to be certain solvents <e> <s> the point is that the local authority whence the waste comes understands the industrial processes in its area <e> <s> that is the worry that many of us have <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this is the first time that i have been in a position of welcoming a bill moved by the noble lord the minister <e> <s> i very much welcome this bill and consider that it is environmentally probably the most important piece of legislation or work concerned with minerals that we have seen since the planning acts <e> <s> it certainly does a great deal more for the environment than the control of pollution special waste regulations that we debated the other night <e> <s> i should also like to thank the minister for his very clear exposition on the content of what really is a very complicated and technical bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have my notes with me i have sent them to <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl is moving on from that point i should like to ask him a question about this <e> <s> i take the point that the regulations have to be up-dated but that is for the future <e> <s> i want to know quite clearly and plainly whether we in this house shall have a sight of the original regulations the regulations before they were up-dated or changed while this bill is proceeding <e> <s> as i said i am not very happy about the legislation going through and then by affirmative or even negative resolution having these regulations put down <e> <s> i think that we should know and this has been said on all three sides of this house what in fact is contained in the regulations that is to say the basis of the compensation <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister says that more money has been allocated this time than previously but can he say whether in view of the heavy restrictions on public expenditure especially that of local authorities he is satisfied that in every authority those people in special need are getting what they are entitled to under the legislation <e> <s> secondly and i do not expect an answer to this question now can he say how the ways in which local authorities are dealing with those who are not in special need but for whom home insulation is very important vary in different parts of the country <e> <s> i remind the minister although i am sure he knows it that this scheme also is an economy because it is a method of energy conservation <e>", "<cs> may i just say that i should like to support the minister in what he has just said <e> <s> it seems to me that the best way is to amend the gdo i would certainly support that <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it would be helpful to the committee if i spoke to my amendment now because as the noble viscount said our two amendments are rather similar and are trying to achieve the same end by different means <e> <s> i think we are at one in feeling that there needs to be an extension of the definition of minerals and the association of county councils and the ama have made representations about this <e> <s> together they represent all the mineral planning authorities in england and wales and they wish to see the definition extended <e>", "<cs> i very much hope that the government will resist this series of amendments <e> <s> i am rather amused when the noble lord lord mottistone brings in stevens in aid because he has a number of amendments running through this bill which are way out from stevens and are so different that one would think it was an entirely different bill <e>", "<cs> i do not have anything against the amendment in principle but i thought that it was covered by the existing development system anyhow and therefore while worthy was not necessary <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the minister and on that assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> does the minister by that reply mean that the provision itself will not be lost since i believe that the core of it is absolutely essential <e> <s> if he is talking of perhaps redrafting it i should go along with that but not if it means eroding the whole provision <e>", "<cs> when the minister takes away the amendment to consider it will he bear in mind the fact that throughout the debates on the local government bill many of us including perhaps the noble lord lord sandford remarked on how everything was going to the centre whereas local authorities themselves ought to have more responsibility <e> <s> i understand very well the motivation behind the amendment but again it is all a question of coming back to the centre <e> <s> i am greatly in favour of watchdogs but i think that in this case the noble lord is perhaps overdoing the barking <e> <s> i should have thought that the way the matter is left at the moment there is absolutely no reason why if necessary the mineral authority should not consult the forestry commission or the relevant ministry either the department of the environment or the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food <e> <s> when i think of the amount of paper work and the number of officials which would be involved i wince to think that consultation should take place every year <e> <s> if the government can find such resources let them put them into housing or something similar that is more necessary than this <e>", "<cs> what i am concerned about is that i do not quite know what stages means <e> <s> does it mean as the outer parts are done or does it mean that for instance as the drains or whatever it is are put in the whole operation stops until the end of that stage <e> <s> i think we must have a functional definition and understanding of what the word stages means because obviously is not clear from the amendment <e>", "<cs> in withdrawing the amendment i should like to thank the minister <e> <s> i am sure that he will take into consideration that this is the first amendment where there has been all-round agreement from everybody who has spoken <e> <s> i know that it will be difficult but i hope that an imaginative result will be forthcoming otherwise a very great opportunity will be missed <e>", "<cs> the amendment i am moving next is to increase the period from five years to years and five years is firmly written in subsection <e>", "<cs> i have to apologise to the committee because i made a mistake over the increase from five to in connection with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i should have been making that point in connection with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it would be very nice if the minister would say yes now and accept the years otherwise i would ask him to consider the extra flexibility that where it is necessary the period should be increased <e> <s> i am not for one moment suggesting that it should always be years but as i said when speaking to the wrong amendment it may be necessary for provision to be made for longer periods to cover particularly difficult restoration schemes <e> <s> i am sorry to have confused the noble lord but perhaps he could answer me on that point <e>", "<cs> i will not press this at the moment but i will read what has been said and think about it again and perhaps come back at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i was very intrigued by the noble lords attempt to change this so i have got from the large <e>", "<cs> i would disagree completely with what the last two noble lords have said <e> <s> i do not think for one moment that this clause or any part of the bill brings agriculture into planning <e> <s> i am getting more and more despondent about the way in which the noble lord lord mottistone and some of his noble friends are dealing with this bill <e> <s> the amendments which have been moved to clause have set out to erode what is an extremely important part in fact one of the lynchpins of the bill and now what he is trying to do is to leave out the whole clause <e> <s> i should like to express very strong support for the after-care provisions in the bill <e> <s> i know that the emphasis on effective restoration is strongly supported by mineral planning authorities particularly the association of metropolitan authorities and it is unfortunate that the noble lord supported by or supporting whichever way one wants to look at it the cbi is really attempting as i must say with great respect to wreck the bill <e> <s> that opposition would not only run contrary to the mineral authorities but it would run counter to the views of the minerals industry <e>", "<cs> i think probably it would be convenient to the committee if in discussing this amendment moved by the noble lord lord mottistone i also spoke to my amendment which follows to reduce years to years <e> <s> the minister has dealt with the question of retrospection but nowadays planning permission for mineral working specifies the time by which such working must stop <e> <s> it was not so in the past <e> <s> this is why some existing sites where no such conditions were imposed may have operated for many decades <e> <s> one cannot go on indefinitely without the local authority having any control whatever unless it is forced also to pay massive compensation <e> <s> this clause tackles this problem by providing that in these circumstances the workings will from the passing of the bill have a future life of years <e>", "<cs> this clause is an extremely important clause in the bill and one that we on this side of the committee and i personally certainly support and would wish to see strengthened <e> <s> it is no surprise that the noble lord lord mottistone in putting his own and the cbi view wishes to do exactly the opposite <e> <s> where working has stopped local authorities will be able to go in if necessary and and i emphasise this subject to the secretary of states approval they will <e>", "<cs> once again i agree with the minister on this <e> <s> in addition to what he has said i would only add that local authorities have neither the inclination nor the resources to try to secure unreasonable prohibition orders <e> <s> again there is the protection of confirmation by the secretary of state <e> <s> therefore i hope that the committee will accept the views expressed by the minister and supported by this side of the committee and reject this amendment <e>", "<cs> this is rather different from the involved discussion we had last time on the difference between possible practicable and reasonable <e> <s> i see what the noble lord is trying to do <e> <s> what worries me is that he is creating a weakening instrument and laying the whole thing open to interminable lawyers arguments <e> <s> it is going to be difficult to define what is a reasonable requirement <e> <s> this could go on for ages and ages <e> <s> it may be that the noble lord lord mottistone has that particular cunning point in mind for which i do not blame him <e> <s> he is trying his best so far as i can see to wreck a great part of this bill <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mottistone said people would think first if they thought that what they were doing was unreasonable can the noble lord give me an example of anybody who has put forward anything and has then admitted it was unreasonable <e> <s> the upshot of what he was saying was that if somebody was going to put forward something that was unreasonable that person would be likely to say it is unreasonable so i will not put it forward if the word reasonable was included but in my view things do not work that way <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment strongly because it represents an improvement in that it does what is necessary in this part of the bill by inserting a time limit <e>", "<cs> i very much hope that the noble lord will withdraw the amendment <e> <s> while i feel that on the face of it this proposal has some merit and would seem to be acceptable from what the minister has said and it is my thinking too there are very severe objections <e> <s> with regard to the two proposals put forward i should like to emphasise that it could be reasonable to permit a local authority to serve notice of a suspension order at the same time so that both prohibition and suspension orders could be considered <e> <s> alternatively there would be merit in allowing the minister to rule that working had ceased within the meaning of the clause and then ruling subsequently on the specific conditions imposed as a consequence of the suspension order on the order itself <e> <s> one of the great advantages of that would be that it would cut out further delay in deciding whether working had ceased <e> <s> i hope that in view of what the minister has now said it will be possible to come back on report with something along the lines of this compromise proposal <e>", "<cs> this amendment contains the same proposal in regard to suspension orders as does amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> frankly speaking i consider that these are wrecking amendments which introduce unnecessary and quite unreasonable delay and i believe that unreasonable is the correct word in this context into the procedures introduced by the bill <e> <s> many things change in five years in particular in shallow working and in those rare circumstances where local authorities wish to serve a prohibition order that is subject to the safeguard of ministerial approval they certainly should be enabled to do so <e> <s> i hope that the minister will take the same line in this regard <e>", "<cs> i was not going to come in again on this but i cannot let go by what the noble lord lord mottistone said <e> <s> one would think from what he said that the only people with a concern for the environment is the cbi <e> <s> perhaps they should change their name from cbi to environmentalists <e> <s> i am sorry to say this but it is absolute nonsense <e> <s> as the minister has said more than once as we all know consultations have taken place industry has had its say and environment has had its say to get the balance right <e> <s> i think that it is grossly unfair and quite untrue to give the impression that the whole balance has gone over to the side of the environmentalists <e> <s> when anything has been put which is rather more on the environmental side it has always been brought back to try to get the balance <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> on this occasion i should very much like to support the noble lord <e> <s> this amendment is not only possible it is practicable and reasonable <e> <s> it seems totally unnecessary for the secretary of state to be involved when there is no opposition to a suspension order <e> <s> if this amendment achieves its end i cannot comment on its drafting i shall certainly support it <e> <s> i shall be very interested to hear what the minister says on it <e>", "<cs> i hope that this amendment will not be accepted <e> <s> the local authority associations have come out very strongly in support of an appeals mechanism if local authorities refuse to revoke a suspension order <e> <s> i believe that an appeals procedure is necessary because local authorities must have the power to refuse to revoke a suspension order on the grounds that substantial work has not recommenced <e> <s> clearly there could be circumstances where operators will once the secretary of state has confirmed a suspension order merely notify the local authority that they intend to start work in order to avoid the cost of tidying up the site as specified in the suspension order <e> <s> this may not apply to many cases but in a statute one has to look at every side of the problem <e> <s> if in reality they may not be doing any substantial work a local authority must have the right to monitor this and to refuse to revoke the order <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lord lord nugent of guildford in the amendment that he has moved but i think there are two different points involved one in the first part of the amendment in subsection of the new clause and one in subsection <e> <s> on the question of the review i think it is absolutely essential that something of this sort should be written into the bill <e> <s> i know that there was a government survey of but that was not done with this necessarily in mind <e> <s> i think that today as the noble lord lord nugent has so well put it people are having to live with this historical dereliction and that is something which in we are far more conscious of whether it is urban conservation country conservation or environmental damage which has been caused in the line of industrial development <e>", "<cs> since the minister has embarked on the general principle of compensation i would say a word on that <e> <s> i appreciate the problem that it is difficult to distinguish between the different amendments because they all link together <e> <s> i welcome the principle that there should be regular reviews of mineral permissions and that operators should bear part of the costs of improving conditions <e> <s> the problem is that most of the meat in this issue is going to appear in regulations which we have not seen <e> <s> we are rather talking around the subject without getting to the financial heart of it <e> <s> even when they are tabled they are subject to affirmative resolutions in both houses and they therefore cannot be subject to any change and have to be accepted or rejected <e>", "<cs> may i support the noble lord lord nugent in this <e> <s> he is absolutely right over the technical changes <e> <s> what we are talking about is a five-year minimum so i hope that the government will stick to that as it is in the bill <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord does whatever he intends to do with his amendment i must once more press the government a little further <e> <s> i can see that central government will not accept a blank cheque <e> <s> but we are in a real dilemma the noble lord lord nugent of guildford is absolutely right in that local authorities just do not have the necessary resources <e> <s> it is no good just paying lip service to the idea <e> <s> the minister has spoken very sympathetically as he did on a previous amendment <e> <s> he said that he understood how we all felt and that he would look at this and that <e> <s> but the noble lord lord nugent was quite right i do not think that any of us can feel that we have achieved anything of real substance anything which would be realistic and practical in the bill and which would help tackle this very difficult problem <e>", "<cs> the minister is not saying is he that every local authority which asks for per cent <e> <s> derelict land grant gets it <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl replies i do not want again to go over what i said earlier because as he himself said he has widened the whole thing otherwise i would have waited until the noble lord lord mottistone raised it here <e> <s> but i should like to feel that he will give an answer on the points i raised either in reply to this or on clause in particular on the questions to do with thresholds and the whole question of your lordships house debating the regulations and what is going to be in them <e> <s> but i do not want to repeat my whole speech again <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl leaves that may i thank him for that very full statement <e> <s> but i am still not quite clear or happy about it <e> <s> when he says that a statement will be made at report stage does he mean a statement of roughly what will be in the regulations or a rehash of the consultation paper or what in fact has now come out from the cbi <e> <s> i thought that they had spent day and night for ages discussing this and i am surprised they are still going on in this way <e> <s> i am still not convinced from what he has said that there is going to be an opportunity to debate the regulations in this house before they are laid before us in due course of time <e>", "<cs> in the circumstances and for the time being i shall withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i should like to look at it again and look at what the noble earl has said <e> <s> if i still feel the same way i shall come back at a later stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have some sympathy with the noble lord lord mottistone in this matter <e> <s> the noble earl practically put me off the point until he said that he was quite sure that any secretary of state would do so in the future <e> <s> that seems to me to be a commitment that the secretary of state would in fact consult <e> <s> if the problem is who would he consult <e> <s> and it sounds rather rude to say perhaps he will go away and think about it then there does not seem to be any reason why that should not go in <e> <s> as he accepts that consultation should be part of it and since we have this worry about regulations and i think that we shall continue to have it i would not be unhappy to see this amendment in the bill if it is possible to do so without spreading the issue too widely <e> <s> i know what the noble earl means but he did say that the secretary of state would consult <e>", "<cs> i hope that the government do not accept this amendment <e> <s> it is somewhat similar to amendment no <e> <s> on which the noble lord lord mottistone felt he had been given some joy by the noble earl <e> <s> i hope it does not turn out that way because both amendments are intended to restrict compensation by more than the consultation paper indicates <e> <s> this undermines the effectiveness of the bill by restricting the amount which an operator will have to pay on a site that is subject to a number of reviews and orders <e> <s> yet surely this would occur only in the case of poor and ineffective operators where local authorities have to go back periodically to try to ensure that operations are carried out without detriment to the locality and then restored effectively <e> <s> good operators will have nothing to fear from this bill and they do not need this kind of amendment <e> <s> i am surprised that the cbi should be concerned to protect inefficient operators and those who lack concern for the environment <e>", "<cs> i very much hope that the government will not accept these two amendments <e> <s> as it is drafted the bill requires local authorities to pay full compensation if they seek to vary conditions that are fundamental to the working of a site <e> <s> what this amendment seeks to do is to add to the list something which is not fundamental <e> <s> one can go on and on just adding things and it should not be in the primary legislation <e> <s> local authorities should be able to vary conditions on the height or area of a tip and they should come within the compensation provisions <e> <s> but they certainly should not be spelled out in the bill in this way while amendment no <e> <s> is a kind of catch-all amendment <e> <s> it would be quite wrong to have this in the statute much as i like to have things spelled out in statutes <e>", "<cs> i should very much like to support the intention behind this amendment moved by the noble lord lord gisborough but i hope that it will be unnecessary because i hope the government will <e>", "<cs> when this matter was raised before in connection with an earlier amendment i think i am right in saying that the noble lord lord bellwin said that he would consult with the adc and the acc <e> <s> i hope the noble earl will ask him also to consult with the ama which is a county planning authority in relation to certain areas and in some respects will be a mineral planning authority <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that with bankruptcies running at a conservative figure of about a week there would be bankruptcies in a year compared with the figure that the noble lord lord orr-ewing gave which i notice that the minister did not even accept <e> <s> would it not be better if the governments economic policies were aimed at keeping from bankruptcy the small businesses that exist now <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much welcome this amendment <e> <s> as the minister was good enough to say i moved a similar amendment on committee <e> <s> the main difference between the amendment moved by the noble viscount lord ridley and my own was the point about railway embankments and also disused roads <e> <s> i think this amendment makes the bill even better and clause more specific so i welcome it and thank the government for it <e>", "<cs> may i say a brief word on this amendment because it addresses itself to the problem that the noble lord lord mottistone raised in committee <e> <s> it is true i believe that this part of the bill is drafted rather widely and it applies to the whole section <e> <s> the point i want to make is that the amendment would not tighten up the wording as such but would completely destroy the intention of this part of the bill <e> <s> as i see it as long as an operator when depositing waste material on a site declared that it would be his intention to carry out further operations in the future then any operations on that mineral deposit at any time in the future would not require planning permission <e> <s> this i find so imprecise that it would effectively exempt working on all deposits because automatically operators could state that they had the intention at some time in the future of carrying out further operations <e> <s> this commitment would in no way inhibit or restrain them <e> <s> they would not have to follow it up in practice but they would automatically by a simple declaration remove certain operations from <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord the minister will forgive me i am very sorry the noble lord lord mottistone was upset <e> <s> it really was not anything to do with my advisers <e> <s> obviously it was a joke that fell flat it was meant to be a very good-humoured quip <e> <s> i was getting sleepy and i felt it was time we woke everything up a bit <e> <s> of course the noble lord has the right to put down the amendment <e> <s> i just felt that when he thought it over he would think it not a very sensible thing to do <e> <s> this is not casting any aspersion on him <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to support the minister as regards this amendment because when it came up in committee i opposed it on the grounds that it seemed to me that there was no reason why mineral workings should be treated differently from other planning permissions and also it did not appear that there was any hardship suffered by the operators <e> <s> like the minister i also have made inquiries <e> <s> as well as the acc the ama have also done a survey on this <e> <s> in all the cases where it was examined it was found that the mineral planning authorities were always open to any applications or requests from operators for a longer starting period <e> <s> in fact the requests were practically none <e> <s> as the minister said there were i think three we know of in the shires <e> <s> so far as the ama and the metropolitan district is concerned only one has come to the surface <e> <s> in many other areas there have been no requests at all <e> <s> i will not rehearse the reasons because i am so much in agreement with what the minister said about this but i hope that the government will stick to their last about this <e> <s> he said at the beginning something to the effect that there may be opportunity in another place but i hope he will stand firm on this <e> <s> i also hope that the noble lord lord mottistone will not take this personally because i am talking about the subject of the amendment and not because he personally moved it but if he looks at this and does his own inquiries among the mineral planning authorities he will find that there is enough flexibility <e> <s> if people require it and can substantiate the reasons for a longer starting date they will be able to get it <e> <s> i hope with the government that he will find it possible to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not going to say anything but as i am in agreement with the noble lord lord mottistone on this i feel i ought to register it and be able to read it in <e>", "<cs> my lords i also support this amendment and like the minister should like to express my thanks to the noble lord lord sandford for pointing out this omission to us on committee <e> <s> it is obviously necessary that the scope of these reviews should be wide enough to embrace this category of planning permissions <e> <s> it was in order to make sure that the scope of reviews was sufficiently wide that i moved another amendment on th february at column that would enable local authorities to look at non-operational workings which had ceased work at any time they chose in the historical past <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has made a very persuasive speech and as i said earlier i have no reason to believe that what he promises will not be done <e> <s> i am sure he agrees with me that this matter has nothing to do with the question of which government are in power rather it is a question of what should be included in legislation to be implemented by whichever government happen to be in power at the material time <e> <s> i still feel that the obligation ought to be written into the legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords with that explanation from the minister and may i say how glad i am that the minister is also thinking of other amendments and in particular the one he mentioned about co-operation and consultaton is one with which i would agree entirely i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should just like to say that i also understand the concern of the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> i agree that the way in which it is drafted at the moment is still far too wide and when the minister is looking at it i hope he will take very clearly into account that local authorities in deciding whether <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the noble lord lord mottistone is quite right <e> <s> i did support this and it still seems to me to be perfectly all right in principle <e> <s> regarding the wording or the drafting perhaps we might hear what the minister has to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted that the minister will accept the second amendment <e> <s> i hope that counsel will do what is required and that the noble lord is not relying on me to find words that are acceptable <e> <s> if he is we shall go on for ever <e> <s> but seriously i am pleased to hear that <e> <s> i agree that amendment no <e> <s> moved things along a considerable way but i did not feel that the reply which i had in committee permitted me to leave the matter as it was <e> <s> with that assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord withdraws the amendment i take it that we can only discuss the amendments put forward although the minister has made a long and meaty statement on compensation which i shall really have to study <e> <s> i think perhaps we should have had it circularised in advance because it was very difficult to take it all in <e> <s> however it was necessary and it came at the right time and we were promised that we should have it <e> <s> all i can say after a first hearing without the words in front of me is that having considered the consultation paper on compensation and having listened to what the ministers have said during the passage of the bill and particularly what the minister has said today i am now largely convinced that the proposals put forward by the government are reasonable and practicable <e>", "<cs> i too should also like to welcome this formal recognition of consultation particularly as it ties up with the amendments i was moving earlier nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> this seems to me to help the situation along <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister no doubt remembers we on these benches resisted the proposals when the enabling legislation was introduced <e> <s> he will also no doubt remember that we were joined by many of his noble friends <e> <s> the community as i think he has pointed out is the primary beneficiary of planning control <e> <s> in the commons when this matter came <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but i was waiting until he had finally left the point about more staff <e> <s> if there are not going to be more staff the point i raised on that was how then is he going to avoid increased delays <e> <s> because i think they are alternatives <e> <s> as the noble baroness lady elliot also said there is obviously going to be more work so if there is not going to be more staff would the noble lord not agree that the chances of more extensive delays must be there <e>", "<cs> my lords so that there is no misunderstanding the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> i argued in favour and i remember it well <e> <s> i am still in favour and i have said so of the extension of the gdo <e> <s> i said that i thanked the minister for that and also for the points he had taken on board from the amendments moved by my colleagues <e> <s> but i was not arguing for planning fees at the same time <e> <s> what we are talking about today is the planning fees <e>", "<cs> my lords will not the minister agree that it is the responsibility of local planning authorities to counter the drab standardisation of many big developments by reflecting local building conditions or by being innovative <e> <s> will not being told not to be over-fastidious about the colour of bricks paragraph of the circular discourage authorities which should be encouraged to improve the quality of local life <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for the way in which the new amendments have been drafted in fact for the way in which practically the whole of one clause has been redrafted in such a short time to meet some of the points raised by me and by noble lords opposite about which we were all in agreement <e> <s> i extend in particular a warm welcome to the amendments relating to amenity and after-care <e> <s> between them they meet the case which with the support of many noble lords i originally put in committee on th february <e> <s> they are an amalgamation of two amendments which i moved the first in committee at col <e> <s> at the time the minister felt that this was too wide to be acceptable but now it has been found to be acceptable <e> <s> for this i am very grateful <e> <s> i moved the second amendment during the report stage on th march at col <e> <s> naturally i am delighted that these amendments which were always intended to be constructive to convey the spirit of the bill and to extend its scope have now been recognised as a meeting point which has general support both inside and outside the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to thank the minister very much for the very kind remarks he made about myself and my noble friends on this side <e> <s> then i should like to thank him for the very courteous and informative approach he has adopted throughout the progress of the bill through this house <e> <s> like him i have found it extremely pleasant to be on the same <e>", "<cs> my lords while appreciating the special circumstances of this case and also being only too well aware of the problems raised by diplomatic immunity and the natural desire of the foreign office not to offend foreign missions but in view of this and what has happened recently to the chinese embassy in portland place will the government indicate that they will take steps to ensure that foreign governments will not be allowed to continue to flout the building controls which apply to all other citizens <e> <s> i appreciate that this is a difficult situation faced by all governments but it is getting rather serious <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to thank the minister for his very clear and brief exposition of the order <e> <s> we should be quite clear at this stage that there is a great difference between this order and the london docklands order which at the moment is being considered by a committee of this house <e> <s> so anything i say about the order we on these benches are not objecting to it does not in any way apply to what might evolve during the discussions on the london docklands order <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may intervene i was waiting for the minister to finish the sentence i do want to make it clear that i was not suggesting nor would i that the bondholders should not be repaid <e> <s> i think that would be quite wrong <e> <s> what i was suggesting was that the government should take that financial responsibility themselves so that it did not come out of the money given to the mdc <e>", "<cs> my lords at a time when the housing lists are getting longer and longer and when there has been such a complete cutback in house building and in the construction industry would the noble viscount not agree that to demolish any houses which would be suitable for civilians or anybody else to live in would be absolutely awful <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that many of the empty houses to which the noble baroness has referred would have been made fit for occupation if local authorities had not been subjected to the moratorium in addition to the sharp cuts in the housing investment programme <e> <s> secondly in view of the acute housing shortage will the government now treat finance to enable local authorities to repair vacant property and bring it into use as a priority allocation <e> <s> before he tells me that there were a number of empty houses under the last government which unfortunately was the case may i also ask the minister whether he is aware that the last government issued a circular on the better use of vacant property <e>", "<cs> my lords may i further ask the minister how he thinks this is going to help housing in the short term which is what we are also talking about <e> <s> are the government going to raise the moratorium <e> <s> in view of the lengthening housing waiting lists will they allocate additional finance <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the minister for repeating to us the statement which has been made in another place <e> <s> having said that i fear that i must first point out that the statement contains very few details <e> <s> i have only just this moment been able to get a copy of the decision letter which i have not even had a chance to finish reading but having had a glance through it i see that this also does not cover many of the very important and relevant points <e> <s> i should first like to ask the minister this what is the hurry about this <e> <s> having asked him that i think i can give him the answer <e> <s> it is the glc elections coming up next month when the greater probability is that there will then be a labour glc whose hands will be tied by this statutory instrument <e> <s> that is the reason for this <e>", "<cs> my lords newspapers have a wide fascination which acts like a magnet picking up diverse opinions often uncomplimentary to the press and expressed with a reckless confidence and an awesome authority which have little relation to reality <e> <s> this does not apply of course to the moderate speech made by the noble lord lord birdwood and indeed we are indebted to him for keeping this important subject under current review <e> <s> we are also indebted to my noble friend lord mcgregor of durris who i am delighted to learn will be speaking later in this debate whose royal commission on the press produced an excellent analysis of its current state <e> <s> many of the reports recommendations still need to be implemented <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that one of the problems that occurred in the past i had some connection with this in the department of the environment was that it was difficult to get a proper organisation of the people concerned with the carnival <e> <s> does he agree that it is extremely important that there should be a strong cohesive committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i want first to thank the minister for reading that statement which has been made in another place but i should like to point out right away that i find it slightly misleading that the statement should say that the working party set up under the chairmanship of professor lawther was <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect i think we should have it right on the record <e> <s> the minister said that it was set up but we are doing the report <e> <s> i think he must either agree or not agree that the working party under professor lawther was set up by the last government <e> <s> this is a fact <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to come back to this matter and i apologise to the minister for putting so many questions to him <e> <s> it was all done so quickly that i did not have a chance to sub my own questioning so he was landed with the lot <e> <s> i would like if possible to have the answers in writing when he gets them <e> <s> however i should like to say having listened carefully to what he said in reply not only to me but to the noble lord lord avebury and to the noble lord lord kennet that it appears that the government do not seem to be sufficiently apprised of how public opinion is moving in this area and having reached the point of talking about the noble lord has not yet really gone into the question which i tried to press him on as regards the cost <e> <s> by doing it in two bites it will be not only very much more unhealthy for the country but very much more costly for industry for the oil companies and for individual motorists <e> <s> i beg him to use what i am sure is his considerable influence to make the government think about this again and to discuss the matter further and really consider reducing <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister could perhaps write to me on that because the number which he gave who have applied is not on the records <e> <s> i should like to know the number of actual sales that have been completed because i think that is where we probably differ <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to congratulate the sponsors of this private members bill mr hastings in another place and the noble lord lord nugent here today in having succeeded in getting this far through the legislative process <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble lord for the cogent and lucid way in which he explained the bill which saves me going over a great deal of it again as background because he has covered it so well <e> <s> as he says it is a complicated subject <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i wonder whether he could answer a question which could be of help when we reach committee stage <e> <s> the amendments i was putting seemed to me to fall into two parts <e> <s> first there were those amendments on fines trees wasteland and minerals which were in schedule of the no <e> <s> bill <e> <s> as the noble lord seemed to be opening that door a little it would be helpful to know why if those items were in the no <e> <s> bill and were also asked for in another place and had already been drafted by parliamentary counsel is there any difficulty about them <e> <s> secondly although i agree that the point about listed buildings is a different one because it was not in the schedule i am frankly mystified why there should be any difficulty about something which has already appeared in a schedule in a government bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for repeating the statement which was made by his right honourable friend in another place <e> <s> may i say that it does fill one with total alarm and despondency at what has been happening between local government and central government in this country <e> <s> first i think it is fair to say that the concept of overspending in this generalised way is really an invention <e> <s> what local government is not able to do is to comply with arbitrary <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i thank the noble baroness lady seear for giving the house today the opportunity to debate these two very important subjects <e> <s> i look forward very much to hearing the maiden speeches of the right reverend prelate the bishop of lichfield the noble lord lord beloff and my noble friend lord jenkins of putney <e> <s> i hope that the house and the minister will forgive me if have to leave before the end of the debate <e> <s> i took on this duty at the last moment and i have an engagement to fulfil which i cannot get out of <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that there is a great deal of anxiety on the part of many people who are concerned and have the interests of the society at heart as they feel that it looks as though the charity commissioners are giving the house to the trustees rather than to the society <e> <s> although the government are not responsible for the day-to-day affairs is there not a point at which the government will have to come in before it becomes too late or before there is litigation <e>", "<cs> my lords if this is to be more than a cosmetic exercise does the minister agree that the resources for infrastructure such as roads sewerage and reclamation of derelict land are badly needed for many enterprise zones particularly those with highly derelict areas <e> <s> is he aware that in the committee stage of the local government and planning bill the minister in another place on the th may at col of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to come back and perhaps i did not hear what the minister said but i do not think i received an answer to the specific question about grants for infrastructure which is extremely important <e>", "<cs> i am very happy to support this series of amendments to which i put my name and as i understand the government are going to accept them i am even more pleased because they are amendments for which i was pressing at second reading <e> <s> i think they now make the fines more realistic <e> <s> i have one minor reservation <e> <s> i am only sorry that they are not going to be updated to reflect the substantial inflation which is taking place and which i pointed out on second reading but i gather there is a problem in the home office in that respect which is concerned with all the fines <e>", "<cs> this amendment is one which i very much welcome as again it was something which i pressed for on second reading <e> <s> i feel particularly strongly about this subject because we have suffered such a loss of trees in this country that anything that will strengthen tree preservation protection and replacement is really of great importance <e> <s> there is just one point i should like to put to the noble earl the minister <e> <s> i understand that the whole areas of tree preservation protection and replacement is under review by the two local authority associations the association of metropolitan authorities and the association of district councils <e> <s> i hope that he can today give us some indication that the government will respond positively when the associations come forward with proposals for improvement <e> <s> if he is unable to do so perhaps he will write to me <e> <s> i am pleased that the government are going to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment which again i was asking for on second reading <e> <s> at this point and i am afraid that i omitted to do so earlier i should like to thank the noble lord lord nugent for explaining it all so carefully that i have not had to spend any time in explanation <e> <s> this is an extremely important amendment because for some extraordinary reason i do not think anyone knows why it happened this was left out in the original act of <e> <s> as the noble lord explained in order to be able to bring any enforcement to bear on the commission of an offence a second offence had to be committed which was not only ludicrous but highly destructive of the environment <e> <s> this is an important amendment and i am delighted to understand that the government are going to accept it <e>", "<cs> there is one outstanding point which has not been covered by the amendment moved by the noble lord lord nugent <e> <s> this is the point regarding mineral enforcement <e> <s> during the second reading <e>", "<cs> my lords would the foreign secretary agree that the instability in the middle east is caused by a plethora of inter-arab disputes apart from the israel-arab dispute itself <e> <s> would he further agree that resolving the palestinian problem within the parameters at present set out by the eec initiative would not resolve such disputes as the iraq-iran conflict the iraq-syria rivalries the internecine warfare between moslems and christians and other disputes in the area <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to congratulate the committee under the chairmanship of the noble lord lord cross of chelsea on the completion of their marathon work <e> <s> it is the longest select committee inquiry this century and the amount of information they had to assimilate and the material they had to produce was quite formidable <e> <s> i am certainly not surprised that on the last page of the report they do not advise other peers to undergo a similar ordeal <e> <s> if i may say so i think the minister was pitching it rather high despite the work of the committee in suggesting that the whole concept of this should be one of the most important propositions in europe <e> <s> we shall wait and see about that but certainly he is aiming right at the top <e>", "<cs> my lords i did say that it was locally friendless <e> <s> i knew that it had plenty of friends here <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down may i just come back to some of the assurances <e> <s> unfortunately <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth disagree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> and with the agreement of the house i shall speak also to amendment no <e> <s> because that is the substantive amendment the other is really a paving amendment <e> <s> when this bill left this house and on the whole i think that it had a very happy passage through this house i think that we all on both sides including the minister who was extremely reasonable and helpful all through the bill felt that we had sent it to another place in a very good condition <e> <s> most of the amendments that have been made today with the exception of the ones that i am speaking to at the moment and also one further on have really been to tighten up the legislation so that it will be possible to introduce the very positive procedures which were envisaged <e> <s> however i am very gravely disturbed about the fundamental changes which have now been made to the bill in another place and i must say that they have been made to the great disadvantage of the bill <e> <s> i refer to the whole question of compensation which when the bill went to the other place was to be contained in regulations and not in the primary legislation <e>", "<cs> i take it my lords that when i press the amendment the noble lord lord mottistone will not be a teller on my side <e> <s> it might be convenient if i dealt first with some of the points he made before coming to the ministers remarks <e> <s> lord mottistone referred to the splendid opportunities he had had in your lordships house and to some remarks made on second reading <e> <s> it was in order to save the time of the house that i did not go through some of the other points that were made and the other splendid opportunities which the noble lord took and which i am glad to say were not at all successful in this house <e> <s> in fact we did not give way to pressure in this house as unfortunately they did in another place and that is exactly the beginning and end of it <e> <s> it is a very sad tale <e> <s> the noble lord spoke about the poor old local authorities and the business rates <e> <s> the poor old local authorities are being so squeezed by the present secretary of state that they do not know where to turn and even the business rates will not help them very much <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that with the leave of the house i really must answer the noble lord <e> <s> first i said that it could affect the whole environment <e> <s> it is perfectly true that this is the first bill of its type since <e> <s> i am not saying that earlier governments should not have introduced something else of course they should have done <e> <s> but if we are to have new legislation why on earth should we not have it in the best possible way as it was when it earlier left this house <e> <s> any measure that would have a destructive effect on the environment and which we knowingly bring into force through legislation is to be deprecated no matter how small or how large it is <e> <s> i do not think that we can get any further on the argument and i hope that the house will support my motion <e>", "<cs> we are coming towards the end i think of a very long debate on this and there are one or two points that i wanted to pick up without rehearsing so many of the points made by everybody else <e> <s> i think the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter in a very ingenious speech was trying to persuade the right reverend prelates to withdraw their amendment <e> <s> i am sure he had no intention of implying that they did not know what they were doing but quite frankly i found it slightly offensive <e> <s> i found it offensive because i believe that four bishops including the archbishop of canterbury would not put their names to an amendment of this sort without a great deal of thought a great deal of consideration and a great deal of experience of what is going on in the country <e>", "<cs> i hope the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter will not despair of me <e> <s> i will not despair of him either <e> <s> if his mind will open a little maybe i shall convince him the other way or even convince him to abstain <e> <s> that would be victory indeed <e> <s> not unnaturally there has been a great concentration on the churches and their views on this bill <e> <s> i think it has to be said that there are thousands of organisations all over the country who have almost bombarded members of this house and another place with their views on this bill <e> <s> it is not just a question of the churches important though they are <e> <s> it is teachers universities community groups social groups it is a whole range of people and from other countries and not just those black immigrants we are discussing tonight who so often have been brought into the discussion <e> <s> they are a wide-ranging group of people <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord would allow me to intervene for one moment <e> <s> i do not want to prolong his speech or to make difficulties but i hope he will accept that that is not an answer to what i said <e> <s> that is just a series of generalisations <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord avebury <e> <s> the bill gives citizenship by adoption only by virtue of an adoption order made in the united kingdom <e> <s> however adoption orders made overseas are recognised by our law for purposes other than citizenship and a parent is bound by legal responsibilities under them <e> <s> this amendment would allow british citizen parents to confer citizenship on children adopted abroad by a court order under the other countrys laws <e> <s> this seems only reasonable as the parent who has to live and work abroad finds it necessary very often to make an adoption overseas and not here <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree that the numbers are needed in new york because they arrange the tours and everything else all over the country <e> <s> does he also agree that even years ago and at that time i was doing some lectures for the british information services certainly my impression and that of many americans was that the services were very stretched and the staff was a very small one <e> <s> does the noble lord not further agree that the amount of benefit that results from the work of the british information services taking knowledge of <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord monson mentioned the car accident <e> <s> it is true that this happened and for some time this made me wary of the idea of wearing seat belts <e> <s> on the other hand in the same debate it was pointed out by two of the distinguished doctors who spoke that the chances of being killed when thrown out of a car were higher than being killed if you were wearing a seat belt <e> <s> in this case it would have been unfortunate but i would have been a statistic of the road fatalities <e> <s> the chances of being thrown as i was on to the grass verge are not very high and i was lucky <e> <s> but i do not think that one can base law on this <e> <s> in the same debate i pointed out that there are a certain number of unfortunate deaths each year from the use of anaesthetics when people undergo operations <e> <s> but on that basis we do not decide that anaesthetics are lethal and stop using them <e> <s> this becomes a very difficult question <e> <s> i agree with the minister <e> <s> if something like this should happen and i am sticking my neck out here and as a magistrate it came to my court then i am confident that in such circumstances the magistrates would dismiss the case <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that where the collection is done by the local authorities direct anybody who objects has a chance to get some redress but that where it is contracted out as it is in some authorities there is quite a different situation <e> <s> further is it not better to have refuse collected over the weekend than not at all <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that the improved performance by local authorities is in fact far greater than that of central government for would he not also agree that while central government have taken on additional staff for the work particularly part-time inspectors local authorities have had to achieve their improvement with fewer staff and reduced financial resources <e>", "<cs> but my lords is the minister denying that local authorities have had to speed up this work and they have a great deal of work to do with regard to planning appeals with fewer staff and less financial resources <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the spirit behind the amendment <e> <s> also i agree entirely with what was said by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> if the position remains as it is in the bill it will cut out a great many women who are doing part-time work <e> <s> if we look at subsection it is quite clear that a person will fulfil the stated requirements if the secretary of state is satisfied that those requirements were fulfilled in the case of either his father or his mother <e> <s> in a case where it is the mother it is very likely that her work will be part-time <e>", "<cs> just let me interrupt i particularly went out of my way to say that i wanted to make it quite clear that my remarks applied to men as well as women <e>", "<cs> what has just been said by the noble lord the minister makes me feel very uneasy <e> <s> this particular subsection is both very wide and very narrow in its scope and we are back again to what the secretary of state thinks fit <e> <s> i should not have thought that that was good enough and it certainly does not answer the point that was raised by the noble baroness lady elles <e> <s> i do not believe the noble baroness got an answer to the question she asked concerning the definition of the word terminated <e> <s> it appears to me that terminated must mean that the marriage has come to an end and therefore it means that the couple have been divorced <e> <s> it follows from that that the point she made about couples being separated because of religious reasons is very relevant to this matter <e> <s> there are also cases where one of the partners may go off to live with somebody else and although in some cases there may be quite an amicable separation in other cases one spouse may not know where the other spouse is and cannot get in touch <e> <s> neither can one fail to take into account those cases where the childs entitlement is used as a weapon in a marital quarrel <e> <s> this is also something which happens between husband and wife and it seems to me to be quite wrong that the child should suffer <e>", "<cs> it certainly seems to me that this amendment too should be supported because i think the noble lord lord drumalbyn has shown us that if both the parents die the child is not only in great personal and tragic difficulties but also in great citizenship difficulties <e> <s> the noble lord explained the amendment so well that i shall not rehearse these points again <e> <s> but in addition it seems that if the mother of an illegitimate child dies the child will have no right to citizenship without this amendment because the relationship that is necessary for citizenship of an illegitimate child is through the mother <e> <s> therefore if the mother dies there will be no entitlement <e> <s> but if there is a reference to his guardian and the mother dies the illegitimate child will also have a right of citizenship by way of the guardian <e> <s> i shall be glad to hear what the minister says in reply to those points <e>", "<cs> we on these benches shall be supporting this amendment <e> <s> ideally i should like to see the scope widened beyond the european community but nevertheless it is a particularly important matter within the eec for british parents to feel secure in the knowledge that their children will be born british <e> <s> as the noble earl lord bessborough pointed out the freedom of movement provisions in the treaty of rome and in community legislation are intended to ensure that a person who is a national of any member country can move freely between all member countries enjoying essentially the same <e>", "<cs> i think it would really be helpful <e>", "<cs> i think that when i spoke i mentioned the problems that civil servants have to deal with and the secretary of state <e> <s> i really think the noble duke has misinterpreted what has been said on this side of the committee <e> <s> when you are given that sort of job to do it does not mean that you start off having a mean attitude towards it or being unjust <e> <s> it means that you are given a job to do which ought not to be given <e> <s> you are also denying the applicant unless there is a system of appeals the right to appeal against it <e> <s> if this is carried to its logical conclusion one could argue that there should never be any appeals from one court to another <e> <s> what we are arguing is perfectly reasonable <e> <s> both my noble friends and myself have given the examples of other countries which have both objective tests and also appeals <e> <s> i think it would be right and i think most fair-minded people in this country would accept the idea that there should certainly be appeals although we are not going into the detail now <e> <s> it is certainly not a slur on the civil service to say that <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister as always has a very engaging reasonable manner but what he said was not reasonable at all as he knows very well <e> <s> i cannot really believe that a piece of legislation can be right if it is more restrictive when we are dealing with human beings and human feelings and this is exactly what is happening in this bill <e> <s> the noble lord lord avebury was absolutely right when he supported what i said and enlarged on it even more <e> <s> it is making it very much more difficult for wives than it was previously and because of the immigration rules it is not making it any easier for husbands indeed it is making it extremely difficult <e> <s> once again it is left to the subjective test of an official however fair and however reasonable the man or women may be <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble lord the minister for what he has said and all the noble lords who have taken part in this short but very useful debate <e> <s> on the basis that the minister is going to look into this matter and as i said earlier i am certainly not standing on the suggested words if the noble lord can find another definition to cover the specific points which have been made i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i follow up on what some of my noble friends have said and the reply given by the minister <e> <s> the minister said in his reply that five years is long enough <e> <s> my noble friend lord mishcon <e>", "<cs> that is what i thought i said the noble and learned lord had said <e> <s> if there was not a five-year period they could exercise their right at any time <e> <s> in any event i am wondering whether this sort of thing is a task for the churches <e> <s> it would be nice to hear one of the right reverend prelates on the subject <e> <s> is it their duty to try to act as it were as a go-between in this sort of situation when i suspect that they would much prefer there not to be a five-year limit <e> <s> i think they would much prefer people to be able to do this in their own time whenever they choose to do so <e> <s> even so that would not stop their parishioners coming to them for advice <e>", "<cs> when the noble lord lord renton rose to his feet i was completely thrown because when he speaks i immediately think that i must be wrong <e> <s> i am very grateful to my noble friend lord mishcon for rescuing me <e> <s> the intention of the amendment as the minister said is to do away altogether with the limit whether it be five six or eight years <e> <s> whether looking at it again the amendment is perfectly drafted in order to cover that purpose i am not altogether sure <e> <s> nevertheless that was its intention <e> <s> in those circumstances i shall not press the amendment <e> <s> i shall withdraw it have another look at it and if necessary come back on report if we want to continue with the intention <e> <s> we shall then make sure that the wording of the amendment meets what we are trying to achieve <e>", "<cs> frankly i am not very impressed by what the minister said in reply to me when i moved this amendment <e> <s> he relied very heavily on paragraph of the green paper which he was good enough to say was a discussion paper <e> <s> the green paper was produced in <e> <s> a great deal of thinking has taken place since then and i really believe that there has been a change in many peoples minds as regards marriage sex equality and race discrimination <e> <s> therefore i <e>", "<cs> we would like to support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord avebury because as he pointed out i think the bill as it stands does take away the entitlement to registration of a wife who was widowed or divorced within five years of the commencement <e> <s> i feel it would be very hard on a woman who had just undergone the shock of her husbands death or of a divorce when at this sort of time in her life with that type of tragedy she needs a sense of security in order to rebuild her life and needs to remain where she is among her friends <e> <s> she needs to find that she has not lost any entitlement to become british <e> <s> any of these doubts or problems would add unnecessarily to her burden <e> <s> at present a woman who has been married to a united kingdom citizen husband has the right to be registered as a united kingdom citizen herself even if her husband has died or the couple have been divorced <e> <s> again what we are asking for in this amendment is that the current position should still obtain under this bill and that the woman in these circumstances should not be put in the position mentioned by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> may i say something before the noble lord sits down <e> <s> why do the government all the way through seem to want to complicate matters more and more and why are they going to make it more and more difficult for the ordinary person or even the extraordinary person to understand what this bill is about <e> <s> why if as he himself said there was a particularly sad case and i was aware of this should there be the home secretarys discretion <e> <s> on what basis will that discretion be given <e> <s> surely all these cases that i was talking about even generally must be sad cases <e> <s> do you have to show that you are a bit more upset than somebody else <e> <s> do you have to show that your divorce was harder that your husband died in more painful circumstances <e> <s> frankly it all seems to me to be most unnecessary to have to put people to all this trouble and and i shall keep reminding the government the government to extra expense and more bureaucracy which i thought this government were trying to reduce in order to make all these complicatons <e>", "<cs> i have listened very carefully to what the minister said and to the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> i do not find it very satisfactory <e> <s> we are still back to this arbitrary choice of five years and it is a very moot point whether when you have a long as there will be backlog of applications it creates the most work or whether it is when you have it spread over so that people are not put in the position of having everybody who knows about it coming forward in five years at the same time having a lot of unhappy discontented people who are outside the time span <e>", "<cs> this is rather trying to make something very specific when people do not know where they are <e> <s> there are a number of groups of people <e> <s> there are people who will not know anything about it or what to do <e> <s> a number of examples were given this afternnon notably by my noble friend lord pitt of people who will not have the least idea that they in fact have not got british citizenship <e> <s> then there are the people who are worried about it all and do not know how to start attempting it and then there are the people and i should think there are millions of them who will find it almost impossible to find their way through this bill and what their rights are <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have my name down to this amendment and i should like to support what the noble lord lord avebury said in moving it <e> <s> as he has pointed out it is perfectly correct that the effect of the amendment would be to make british citizens of all those persons with british nationality on commencement day who have been admitted already for permanent settlement into the united kingdom <e> <s> under the bill as it stands it will not be the case that they will be citizens <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord avebury replies to the amendment standing in his name the minister said that there would be numerous requests from people asking whether they were british citizens <e> <s> that does not seem to me to be a good reason for turning down an amendment which is going to help a lot of people <e> <s> in any case there will be a great many people under the bill as it stands who will request registration anyhow so the home office will be inundated with requests in that way <e> <s> therefore why not do it in a more equitable and just way as we have suggested <e> <s> if the minister says that he accepts the principle on which the amendment is based but he thinks that it ranges too wide will he undertake to look at it and if the drafting is not quite as exact as it should be will he perhaps let us consider a tighter version rather than throw the baby out with the bathwater <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words about this general position of statelessness which is really contained within the amendment which my noble friend lord gifford has moved <e> <s> both the noble and learned lord the lord advocate and the minister have laid great stress on the fact that we have carried out our obligations under the united nations convention to a greater degree than many other countries <e> <s> indeed as i think we are all aware a great many other countries have not ratified it at all <e> <s> but that we have been a refuge for people is something in which we in this country take great pride <e>", "<cs> may i interrupt the noble lord at this point to try to clear up this matter <e> <s> i shall not go over what my noble friend said about the discussion paper but i do not believe for one moment even after all the discussion that a labour government would have done away with the principle of <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord belstead replies to that point may i just say that these were people to whom a commitment was given <e> <s> yesterday in a crowded house we gave citizenship rights to the people of gibraltar <e> <s> many of the people who are waiting for citizenship rights fought for this country or their parents fought for this country during the war <e> <s> they have always considered themselves as being british and it does seem not only unfair but also incongruous <e>", "<cs> in view of what my noble friend lord gifford said and the case he quoted which the minister said he would look at and also because i am rather concerned as of course the courts do not have to go into the merits of the case i wonder whether the noble lord will look at it again as i shall and perhaps come back to it at report stage <e> <s> or he may feel that he can write to me in the meantime <e> <s> with that i will withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> no i also said perhaps the minister would write to me about it in between stages and he nodded <e> <s> that is why the noble lord picked that up <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for giving us the statement this afternoon <e> <s> the comments i shall make on it will include some of the points in the consultation paper because the two things go together and in this short period of time it has been rather difficult to gather them together <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister leaves that point may i say that i asked about the estimated cost <e> <s> obviously i did not mean to the individual authorities the minister is quite right there <e> <s> and i asked about the projected savings <e> <s> i should have thought that there must be some even fairly notional figure in the mind of the secretary of state or the department when they are bringing this forward because otherwise all we are left with are increased administrative costs <e>", "<cs> during our discussions on this matter in perhaps a somewhat different form earlier it occurred to me that the people in this country and in other countries used to accept very readily what authority said without questioning it <e> <s> that is not so today <e> <s> it is also a fact i think that many lawyers with the best motives in the world are extremely suspicious and concerned that a secretary of state should not have to give his reasons in writing <e> <s> i understand their concern <e> <s> that is also something which has got built into the establishment in this particular area <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of these benches i should like to support the amendment moved by my noble friend lord pitt of hampstead <e> <s> he has stated very clearly why he has now decided on seven years <e> <s> personally i should have preferred five years <e> <s> however if the government would accept seven years it would be a tremendous improvement on the years that is in the bill at present <e> <s> if a child has lived here for the first seven years of his or her life from the nationality point of view he or she is likely to remain here <e> <s> therefore the sooner the child can acquire citizenship the better for the child and also for his or her parents or guardians <e> <s> it is very important that anxiety about a childs future citizenship status should be settled as soon as possible it is also very important from the viewpoint of the schools <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like warmly to thank the government for the tremendous concession that has been made in clause as a response to i think the pressures and arguments from these benches and all sides of the house <e> <s> i am sure that the minister will not mind if i say that this really is a radical and very pleasing u-turn <e> <s> i was also delighted to hear that the government have turned down some of the proposals that they had in mind because of what the noble and learned lord described as horrendous complexity <e> <s> with great respect the bill seems to me still to be full of horrendous complexity and i am delighted that the noble and learned lord is not adding to it <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will remember that in that debate in which many of us took part i argued i do not have the precise reference to hand that the provision should be rather wider so that it applied to a separation which might not necessarily be a legal separation one parent could have deserted the other and his or her whereabouts might not be known one parent might have to remain in employment overseas and the other parent might have brought the child to the united kingdom and decided more or less to settle here <e> <s> i find the provision restrictive although the government have gone some way to improve it <e> <s> but it remains rather restrictive and while i have not tabled an amendment perhaps the minister will say whether this would be normal practice in cases not covered by legal separation <e> <s> also will he define exactly what is meant by legal separation <e> <s> does it mean a judicial separation a separation which has been effected in a magistrates court or must it be a separation through the high court or divorce court <e> <s> we should be clear about that in the first instance <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to thank the minister very much for what he has said <e> <s> that is very satisfactory and f am very pleased that he has confirmed the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister replies there are a couple of points that i want to raise with him <e> <s> first i am really quite surprised that the government have not found it possible to accept the noble lords amendment which for my part was rather too restrictive anyhow <e> <s> but as to the question of the word guardian if the guardian is <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord avebury especially looked at in conjunction with his amendment no <e> <s> which means recognition by a court of law <e> <s> i agree that this is probably rather a clumsy way round but i also agree it is probably the only way in which to deal with this at the present time <e> <s> as i sit as a magistrate i know that people come to court with affiliation or maintenance orders where they are unmarried and that is certainly one way to establish paternity <e> <s> even in a case where for the time being if they are living together amicably but are not married they wanted to come to court to establish paternity for this particular purpose there is no reason why the magistrates should not as in other cases make a token p a year maintenance and keep the case open so that there is no pressure on magistrates to have to allocate sums of money which are not wanted in particular cases <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much welcome these amendments <e> <s> in committee i moved an amendment to add the words <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not really convinced <e> <s> it all sounded very good as i am sure it was meant to do but i am not completely convinced <e> <s> i cannot help thinking that all the way through we have seen the government take a figure five years and then under pressure we had eight years and as has been questioned during the progress of the bill why on earth can we not make it ten years <e> <s> there is not anything sacrosanct about the five years to which the government have been clinging <e> <s> as i recall it in the commons once there was <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister in replying said that the amendment would exacerbate the confusion between citizenship and the right of abode <e> <s> it would seem to me that it would be almost impossible to exacerbate any more confusion in this bill than there is already built into it anyhow <e> <s> most of the amendments that have been brought forward by the government and we are very grateful for many of them because they improve the bill have made the bill extremely lopsided <e> <s> i will not take up time dealing with that now but i am sure that the minister knows what i mean <e> <s> the whole bill has now gone even more out of balance <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister usually prefaces his replies to many of the amendments which we move in a very charming way with the words although i understand the reasons <e> <s> to be quite honest i am getting a little tired of his understanding the reasons and wish he would take some action on those reasons that he has been given <e> <s> in moving this amendment my noble friend lord pitt referred to this being a safety net and that really is what it is <e> <s> we are dealing with people who will have no right of abode anyway <e> <s> if the government at committee stage or even at this stage had said we accept the principle of this but we should like to bring forward a draft which we think would be preferable i am quite sure that my noble friends would have been only too happy to co-operate with him but that is not the position <e> <s> the government have firmly refused to make any concessions on the three citizenship structure <e> <s> i think it is quite wrong for them to cling to their original structure so obstinately by which in fact more anomalies have been created although some good has been done by the amendments which have been moved by the government during the passage of this bill <e> <s> but they are clinging so obstinately to their structure that neither realism compassion nor justice is being able to overtake their first abstract assumption <e> <s> whether we are on this amendment which is an extension of many others that have been discussed it is wrong that thousands of british nationals will have no right of abode anywhere under this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support both amendments although my name is attached to the amendment standing in the name of my noble friend lord pitt of hampstead <e> <s> i prefer his amendment because it is more embracing and wider than that moved by the noble lord lord avebury <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the minister a question <e> <s> as the last amendment on waiving fees was lost i should like to put the following situation to him <e> <s> supposing a person is genuinely intent on getting citizenship as quickly as possible but does not in fact have sufficient money <e> <s> would he be able either to put down a deposit or to get an extension of time <e> <s> i am referring to a genuine case on financial grounds <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support this amendment which is also supported by my noble friends <e> <s> i find the present position very worrying because one has to look at this against the background of the existing rules and the immigration act <e> <s> the position seems to be that a child adopted in the united kingdom is admitted to this country if it is the dependant of a parent who qualifies for entry <e> <s> but if a child has been adopted outside the united kingdom even if it has been adopted by a person who is a full citizen of the country the child has no right of entry <e> <s> it may be admitted but it has no right <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord kennet for raising what is an extremely important question and also for as one expects from him putting it in such a succinct clear and comprehensive way <e> <s> very often as he and i both know having at different times served as ministers in the area of the environment and housing there is a tension and pull between the needs of housing in a local authority and the protection of the environment and the preservation of its valuable conservation areas and <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree with the first article in <e>", "<cs> my lords i have the feeling that the noble lord the minister with whom i have had a number of friendly tussles across the chamber is not quite as relaxed and at his usual affable ease tonight as he is usually <e> <s> the reason for that is quite simple <e> <s> the poor man is having to argue an absolutely impossible and awful case <e> <s> it is very unlike him if he wants a political punch up and so let us get rid of that idea first before discussing what has really happened and what is happening now <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i say that the reason why i did not ask my noble friends to go into the lobbies was not because <e>", "<cs> my lords i was about to ask the noble lord whether he would give way so that i could put a question <e> <s> how is the student who has not got a large sum of money behind him going to be able to pay the rent of a flat or house or whatever it is if there is no sort of control at all <e> <s> what is the evidence <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i do not think the noble lord was here when i spoke <e>", "<cs> i said that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he will do me and also the rest of the house a favour and go away and read my speech <e> <s> because a lot of the things he said really i do take exception to somebody who comes in in the middle of a debate and attacks me not having even been here to hear my speech <e> <s> i think it is discourteous to say the least <e>", "<cs> neither do i <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to delay the noble lord <e> <s> i know he wants to get off and i appreciate that but he has not answered the basic point <e> <s> if the government felt as he has expressed himself <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by congratulating the noble baroness the leader of the house on the clarity of her exposition and on the fact that she told us that it was the first time she had spoken on the gracious address as leader of the house <e> <s> i wish i could say that the picture she painted the policies that she described and what has been announced in the queens speech equalled the clarity of her exposition and the way in which she put it across <e> <s> in fact i have the feeling that she and i are talking about or seeing two entirely different countries with entirely different people with entirely different reactions <e> <s> the queens speech contains a prescription for our economic and industrial ill-health which is largely the same as before <e> <s> the primary emphasis is on inflation and the reduction of public expenditure through a rigid and illusory monetarist fetish <e> <s> privatisation and here i think that the word is as ugly as the dogma of oil and gas and a further legislative attack on the trade unions are thrown in for bad measure <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord will give way <e> <s> if he is referring to the amendment the amendment specifically refers to the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl really suggesting that the private sector should take over responsibility for all the infrastructure for schools for hospitals for roads and for sewers <e> <s> is that what he is saying because otherwise what he is saying about the public sector not creating wealth does not seem to make sense <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord will give way for one moment <e> <s> does the minister agree that when the conservative government came into office in the rate of inflation was per cent <e> <s> it is now higher than that and although unemployment was far higher than we would have wished it was certainly nowhere near over the million nudging million that it is now <e>", "<cs> my lords may i too welcome the committees report and also the way in which my noble friend lord gregson provided such a clear exposition <e> <s> the report which has been referred to as a long one was i thought considering the size of the problem with which it was concerned succinct and really comparatively short and what was really a joy written with simplicity and with clarity <e> <s> in a world where so many millions are living in dire need and poverty it is a terrible irony that we should have the problem of waste even if it is hazardous waste disposal <e> <s> technological advance increases our problems all the time and we are always having to try to keep a balance between the needs of industry and science and the protection of the health and environment of our community <e> <s> i so agreed with my noble friend when he referred to the complacency which has acted as a cloud over this subject for so long <e> <s> i welcome the recommendations and certainly would not dream of going through all of them <e> <s> however i should like to pick out a few which struck me <e>", "<cs> my lords i want first to thank the noble lord lord beaumont for explaining the bill so clearly and so briefly <e> <s> i should also like to say how much i am looking forward to hearing the maiden speech of the noble earl lord winchilsea and nottingham <e> <s> we are all aware that often a great deal of passion is engendered by imbibing the contents of many of these containers but today we seem to be seeing and i think we shall see it further during the course of this long debate a lot of passion engendered by the containers themselves which is rather a new departure <e> <s> unfortunately and it has nothing to do with the passion i shall be unable to stay for the whole debate for which i ask the forgiveness of the house <e> <s> i have a longstanding engagement and did not realise that such a number of speakers would be attracted to this debate <e> <s> i think that i should say that so far as these benches are concerned there will be a free vote if there is a vote on this measure so <e>", "<cs> my lords yes but first i am not sure how it will work out <e> <s> secondly my point is that it should be put back to the manufacturers rather than to the wholesalers and retailers or to the manufacturers and then to the wholesalers and the retailers who would not feel as they now do that they had to bear the whole brunt <e> <s> this is where the main responsibility lies <e> <s> the local authorities would have to come in in some way because if there is neglect in their area then in the same way that the waste disposal authority would have a function on hazardous waste local authorities would have to have some sort of concern with this even if it were only a watching brief <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the minister for repeating the statement that is being made in <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister could answer one of the other points that i raised <e> <s> he will have the figures or i imagine he does <e> <s> what has happened to the authorities of them tory and labour where there have been no sales and there were no returns and the authorities which have not provided any returns at all including authorities like hillingdon brighton luton sevenoaks cheltenham blackpool and thanet all but two of which are tory authorities <e> <s> what action has been taken against any of those authorities <e> <s> as the noble lord did not query the figures i assume that he accepts them <e>", "<cs> my lords could the minister ask his right honourable friend to update the figures so that the other place and we have the opportunity to see them <e> <s> when we are having to work from figures which as i pointed out were given up to the end of june although the parliamentary question was last month it is extremely difficult for us to get the facts right <e>", "<cs> my lords in his opening remarks the noble lord lord monson who is having a bit of a swipe at sex discrimination legislation altogether mentioned that he thought that women i took it that he meant perhaps in this house had got to their present position without coercive legislation <e> <s> on that particular point it is fair to say that your lordships house is more equal than the other place because in this house we have women life peers whereas in the other place there are only women members of parliament <e> <s> so we start with an advantage here <e> <s> but i cannot agree with the noble lord that perhaps luck plus a few other things can take the place of legislation which i certainly do not find coercive <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to vote against the second reading of the bill <e> <s> so far as my noble friends on our side are concernd it is entirely a free vote <e> <s> it is up to them to decide <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the argument i was putting was rather different and i think it does not appear in the document to which he is referring <e> <s> it was my own argument a political one <e> <s> the point i was making was that having been convinced myself so far as one can be that although it is there i have said that it ought not to be there and has not done any harm the fact that it has been so highlighted in this debate can be used as a prod one needs as many prods as one can have whichever party is in power to try to get the necessary legislation through <e> <s> i am afraid that if this goes through on its own there will be an even longer time before the inequities which are just as great in their own way are dealt with at all <e> <s> that was my argument and it is not what the eoc said <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank the minister for repeating the statement made by his right honourable friend in another place <e> <s> my first impression is that it is rather more a short paper for a seminar than a statement of the governments strong intentions more a catalogue of good intentions than of any urgent action <e> <s> in fact it is rather a pity that on the second page the word urgent was changed to basic <e> <s> obviously the word urgent was meant to come in somewhere but it seems to have got lost <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the questions that i asked dealt with the price basis <e> <s> it is important for us to know on what price basis the increase referred to in paragraph f has been made <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for explaining the regulations and while i am not particularly happy about them they are not on a par with matters such as the compulsory sale of council houses and other issues on which there have been some very strong arguments between the government and these benches <e> <s> i must say at the outset that i am not very happy about the reducton in time <e> <s> i take the noble lords point that one should try to speed up these issues not just in the interests of economy and time but because it is obviously an advantage to the applicant to the tenant the landlord or both to have the matters dealt with as expeditiously as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene briefly there <e> <s> there was something i forgot to say when i was speaking <e> <s> i know the minister is very busy i am sure he is as overburdened as everybody else is but i have noticed that when he explains these and other matters himself in his own words it comes over very well and sounds extremely simple <e> <s> will he undertake to have a look himself at the explanation which is given <e> <s> because it really is a matter of communication <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to pursue this but there does not seem to be a great difficulty when putting this out in guidelines and circulars to include the words being at work <e> <s> his honourable friend in another place said when he introduced the order <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to thank the minister for repeating the statement but i also want to make a very strong protest <e> <s> i have not yet been able to get a copy of the new bill or of the green paper <e> <s> they have not yet been released from our printed paper office and it is extremely difficult at a time like this when one is trying to deal with a statement not to have a copy of the green paper or the bill <e> <s> i appreciate that it is not the fault of the minister but that really has to be said <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may take up that point before the minister forgets it he made a point about capital projects <e> <s> there is nothing in this statement about the reduction in manpower affecting only current expenditure <e> <s> would not the minister agree that while there was a certain amount of fat to be carved off we have gone beyond that and are now getting down to the bare bones which as the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley has said is affecting the whole infrastructure of local government and increasing unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords while i find the ministers reply certainly rather hopeful is it not true that at the smithfield district plan inquiry the question of the road route was outside the inspectors jurisdiction <e> <s> would he not agree that this proposed road stems from since when there have been considerable changes in traffic needs and conservation attitudes <e> <s> is not the only proper way for the secretary of state as the minister rather intimated to call this in and consider it together with the appeal which is before him for the three listed buildings and therefore to consider both the road and the unlisted buildings application in what is now a conservation area in an historic part of the city of london <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we are all grateful to the noble lord lord abinger for raising this matter once again <e> <s> this time i think it is probably an improvement on the last bill which was intended to do away with treasure trove because i do not think that at the moment any government of either side would wear that <e> <s> this is a difficult subject because the whole concept of treasure trove is wreathed in a romantic aura of ancient history <e> <s> the words conjure up romance adventure and also of course financial advantage <e>", "<cs> my lords this type of question has been asked many times before <e> <s> is the minister aware that we always get the answer that it will soon be ratified <e> <s> could he perhaps explain what is meant by soon <e> <s> is there going to be some sort of limit to the time the government take to consider it and then when it goes out to all the other areas to which he referred how long is that going to take <e> <s> is it not true that this government and previous governments have been dragging their feet on this <e> <s> can he say how many nations have in fact ratified the convention apart from signing it <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord northfield for initiating this debate <e> <s> i too have seen the written answer to my noble friends question this afternoon <e>", "<cs> i was referring to the first part of the written answer to a question today by my noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the minister it is late and we all want to go home but i want to get this clear <e> <s> will the figures be in the consultation paper as a vehicle for consultation or are the figures firm <e> <s> i am not talking about rationalisation i am talking about the p and the limiting to firms of p <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first thank the minister for the way in which he has explained so clearly the purposes and provisions of the bill and also for his promise to put the notes on clauses in the printed paper office we appreciate that <e> <s> this is a bitty bill and i am afraid it has to be dealt with in a rather bitty way <e> <s> we on this side of the house wholeheartedly endorse the objectives of reducing the pressure of legislation on parliament and saving local authorities the trouble and expense of promoting their own local acts <e> <s> many of the provisions in the bill are to extend valuable powers throughout england and wales and these are to be recommended <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord leaves that point this was something that i left out of my speech because of time are the government taking into account that a local authority may decide that it does not want sex shops in its area but sex shops as they are now are legal so are there no rights for the people who want to have sex shops in that area <e> <s> the minister will be aware that it was suggested in another place that if there were sex shops in brighton worthing could say that it did not want them <e> <s> i think that we are getting near a form of repression over this if we are not very careful <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that partnership authorities lost million in rate support grant during the current financial year compared with last which is a per cent <e> <s> reduction in one year <e> <s> was this not largely because the government reduced the partnership authority share of the rate support grant <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister cannot give me the answer now may i ask him to write to me about it <e> <s> it is very much on the point of government help to the partnership areas <e> <s> i do not think that this point can be brushed aside as though it is not relevant to the question <e>", "<cs> following upon what my noble and learned friend has said it seems to me without his expert advice that this was covered by the bill because clause says that the law of treasure trove <e>", "<cs> i would like to support the noble lord lord abinger in his reply to the noble lord lord digby <e> <s> he is absolutely right <e> <s> a great many things which end up as treasure trove are found by landowners themselves or their agents or third parties whom they have licensed to search <e> <s> where people come on the land and have no right to be there the landowner has the right to expel them or have them prosecuted as trespassers <e> <s> what concerns me when we are discussing this side of the matter is that the tail should not wag the dog <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that putting services out to private contractors does not necessarily promote efficiency or result in direct savings <e> <s> is he aware that by winding down the sub-units of road construction units and using independent consultants rather than direct labour the extra cost is estimated at million up to the end of though it may be much more and that new construction and improvements to roads have had to be cut by at least million <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the matter about which we are concerned that of agreements involving access to the houses <e> <s> is it not true that now the houses are advertised in the <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord would give way on that <e> <s> the point about the magistrates at the moment is that the magistrates are sitting every day <e> <s> applications for occasional licences are coming up before them all the time so it is in the natural round of their duty <e> <s> it just means that you have an extra case or application on your list this is the point about that <e> <s> but i had moved i hope the minister realises this from that position that being one that was not acceptable to the government leaving well alone <e> <s> the government never do as we know ever leave well alone so i have now moved to a different position which i thought might be more acceptable <e>", "<cs> i see that the minister is pretty agile too <e> <s> when i cited my first example from my own court that our clerks and magistrates did not want to take on these functions this was a case of choice <e> <s> i was illustrating the importance of leaving some openness in this matter <e> <s> the noble lord will be well aware but i must emphasise it again that we are not suggesting in our amendment that any more functions should pass to magistrates <e> <s> we are suggesting the reverse that the onus is on the local authority to take on the functions where and when it will <e> <s> it may be that gradually all of them will do so <e> <s> i support what my noble friend lady fisher has said <e> <s> she gave us a very good background and foundation to not only this amendment but the amendments that follow it <e> <s> they are very important <e>", "<cs> yes the minister is right but nevertheless even if there had not been an amendment following it we would have wanted to put in or political in any case <e> <s> i may have made a mistake myself but that is how it struck me <e> <s> i was going to speak to them together but i thought they were two separate things <e> <s> i will carry on and speak to them together <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e> <s> that amendment is not moved because it is consequential on the amendment which has just been lost <e>", "<cs> i did <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the minister for that helpful and generous reply <e> <s> i am afraid what happened on the first amendment was that i got into a bit of a muddle over the amendment and i moved it briefly before one that should have been moved previously so perhaps it was not heard <e> <s> i hope that the minister will be persuaded by what the noble lord lord foot has said which was really on the lines on which i was going to speak <e> <s> we are talking about a political meeting with music as well as a religious <e>", "<cs> i fear that i shall introduce a rather different note into the discussion <e> <s> i want to ask some questions about the matter since i am slightly worried about it <e> <s> in general my heart is with the amendment but i think that the situation is not quite as simple as it appears <e> <s> all noble lords who so far have taken part in the debate have spoken as though the amendment refers only to village halls and with that aspect i have no quarrel at all <e> <s> i think that village halls should be let free of charge and the licence fee should be remitted on every occasion <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for replying to the point i made <e> <s> i must point out that the magistrates in the areas where they have the authority to give licences go round and inspect places and they go round with experts from the local authority <e> <s> particularly if it is a new building the magistrates see it and the local authorities also are asked by the magistrates and very often by the police about the safety side <e> <s> i can see the government will not budge on this aspect but please do not let us have some unnecessary and i am sure the noble lord is not meaning to do this and misleading reasons for turning this down <e>", "<cs> i shall not move this amendment <e>", "<cs> i was waiting to hear what the minister had to say and i had intended to speak on the government amendments as i thought that there was a possibility that the noble earl lord halsbury and the noble lord lord nugent of guildford would withdraw their amendment <e> <s> but the minister has now said fairly specifically what is in the governments <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> my name is attached to some of the other amendments though due to an error on my part my name is not attached to the first amendment in the group <e> <s> at this late hour i should like to speak briefly to the noble lords amendment my own amendment and the government amendment <e> <s> this is one occasion on which i agree with some of the people on the other side of the fence in their approach to the bill <e> <s> i find the spelling out of the meaning in a statute quite obnoxious <e> <s> i also find the drafting rather extraordinary rather rococo <e> <s> i also think that some of the words are redundant <e> <s> many distinguished legal opinions which i have sought agree with my view on the redundancy point <e> <s> i think that this kind of language is quite unnecessary in the statute <e> <s> it seems to me that if the words are omitted from the paragraphs in the way proposed in the amendments almost the whole field would be covered <e> <s> in relation to sex shops the schedule would then refer to <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment in principle <e> <s> this is a new one on me <e> <s> i did not know about sex encounter establishments <e> <s> but it seems to me that if they are going to go into the bill then the definition of sex establishments at the beginning of schedule should have to include sex encounter shops <e> <s> that is my only comment <e> <s> i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> what we have not yet established and what i think is still a very confusing situation is what in fact is meant by relevant locality <e> <s> when we ended the first day of the committee stage last thursday we were still very much in the air <e> <s> the noble earl lord halsbury and other noble lords and baronesses including myself had tried to get a definition of relevant locality it makes a tremendous difference certainly to me if relevant locality means a district or an area within the whole local authority area or whether it means the whole local authority area itself <e> <s> i think that it will be extremely difficult for us to reach a decision either on my noble friends amendment or on the governments amendment until we have a very clear definition of relevant locality <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for the explanation he gave <e> <s> while it clarified the point to a certain extent it did not clarify it sufficiently <e> <s> he said it was possible in theory to take the whole area as the relevant authority and he did not think authorities would do that <e> <s> as we know the legal representatives of authorities cannot refer to <e>", "<cs> i fear that my name appeared on the amendment by error my name was attached to the wrong amendment <e>", "<cs> on an earlier amendment moved by my noble friend lord jacques we had a discussion on both amendments and it ended with the minister undertaking to go back and look at the wording again and particularly at the relevant localities on which a number of us were still unhappy <e> <s> i hope that what he has said now is going to allow him to go back and <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to speak again on this amendment but i really must in view of what the noble lord lord nugent has said <e> <s> he seems to have forgotten or not taken into account what was originally in paragraph of the schedule which states <e>", "<cs> i do not feel very strongly about this amendment <e> <s> the noble lord the minister is quite right in that it seemed to me that as the licence is renewable every year and that it would take some time to go through the processing of applying for a variation no injustice would be done <e> <s> but if this is the usual form of appealing for a variation and since i certainly do not wish to be draconian i am quite happy to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> probably to the surprise of the noble lord lord nugent of guildford and i hope not to his displeasure i rise to support his amendment <e> <s> it seems to me that one would want to avoid any of the legitimate costs of administering the licensing scheme and inspections falling on ratepayers <e> <s> that would be entirely wrong <e> <s> the fees charged should cover the whole scheme as well as just the clerical and administrative costs of licensing <e> <s> i take it that there will always be an auditing check so that any local authority which suddenly got the idea of making a somewhat exorbitant charge would not in fact be allowed to do so <e> <s> we want to see all the costs covered and ensure that the expense does not fall on the public purse on the ratepayers <e>", "<cs> again i would like to support the noble lord lord nugent in his amendment <e> <s> i think it is right and proper and especially in the inflation that we are suffering from today <e> <s> if there is the possibility of injustice to say a small man the amendment does say a fine not exceeding so the maximum is but there is a whole range within that <e> <s> when the minister replies i wonder whether he would be kind enough in regard to the fine not exceeding on summary conviction not the daily fine but the general fine to say whether he would consider doubling that to <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord leaves that point may i put this <e> <s> is it not true that this is really an unwritten principle in the magistrates courts <e> <s> in fact i think there are some other exceptions certain cases of pollution <e> <s> it is a custom <e> <s> before it was raised to i remember when i was first on the bench it was much lower and then it was raised <e> <s> i do not think this is a hard and fast rule embedded in any statute at all <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the minister something <e> <s> i understand that in the glc bill dealing with the same provisions the fine is <e> <s> i do not see why it should be less in this bill than it is in the glc bill <e> <s> as i understand it in the criminal justice bill the fine for obstructing officials in food and drugs is as high as <e> <s> so i am rather mystified as to why the government are sticking to on this <e>", "<cs> as we are taking these amendments together i think that i had better speak to this because in accepting one i am practically accepting the other amendment <e> <s> i am afraid that i cannot make any apology for once again speaking on this particular subject but it is of a grave importance which goes quite beyond the question of sex shops so we should be careful before we just let it slide through <e>", "<cs> i found the ministers reply extremely unsatisfactory <e> <s> he said that because of the proliferation of betting shops we want to make absolutely certain that no court will be able to give the go-ahead to an application for a sex shop which has been turned down by the local authority <e> <s> he was answering obliguely not directly my question as to whether there was confidence in the courts <e> <s> the noble lord lord wigoder was right to say that magistrates courts have for long been handling applications for betting shops and public houses <e> <s> we should add that so far as betting shops are concerned under the gaming act there is a gaming board to which magistrates licensing authorities and so on can refer <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that very clear exposition of this amendment but i have a certain <e>", "<cs> while i thank the noble lord the minister for that explanation i am still concerned that <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord very much indeed i think it is a more than suitable reply <e> <s> i think the noble lord will find that this is present in the derbyshire bill <e> <s> i do not imagine that he will find much argument from the local authority associations <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend decides what to do may i ask the noble lord why in a previous list <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to what the minister said and f can see his point about the sanctions regarding the amendment moved by my noble friend <e> <s> but it seems to me that we have to start somewhere and if all the time we brush these things away like this until we reach absolute perfection we shall not get any improvement at all <e> <s> i would have thought that one way of tackling this problem would be to try to impress on the district councils that they can make orders or even to try to persuade the keepers of premises to display these boards to come along with a design as i did once when i was in charge of the royal parks which is attractive and eye catching so that people will look at it even before they know what it is about <e>", "<cs> i am a little worried about this amendment <e> <s> i shall not go into the merits of the exemptions which the noble earl spelt out there appears to be some merit in them but what worries me is the apparent lack of consultation with local authorities before bringing forward these repeals <e> <s> i see from the list included in the amendment that the acts were all passed in or in other words they have been very recently effected <e> <s> the acts were passed after full hearings before committees of both houses and i am worried that the powers should now be suddenly swept away in this fashion without consultation with the authorities concerned <e> <s> i do not know whether there has been consultation with the local authority associations <e> <s> this point has been raised on one or two other amendments that we have discussed during the passage of the bill and it is this aspect that i and some of my noble friends find rather worrying <e>", "<cs> is the minister able to say whether we shall get a result from those deliberations before this bill becomes a statute <e>", "<cs> we do not want another little bill <e> <s> perhaps as the matter has now been raised by way of an amendment the minister may possibly nudge them on a little <e> <s> it is quite a small point and this is the place in the bill for it <e> <s> it is better than making orders or amending later <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> is it necessary to perpetuate for all of history and the future the term hawk food and food hawking <e> <s> could not the home office the minister or somebody with a nice creative mind think out another phrase which falls more easily on our ears and to our eyes than hawk food or food hawking <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say as a one-time chairman of the health education council that i am glad as always to hear the government are putting money into it <e> <s> it seems an odd situation for it is a drop in the ocean will he not agree <e> <s> compared with what the advertising companies are spending on advertising <e> <s> in view of that fact is it not true that his answer to the noble lord lord airedale should have been that the government do not subscribe to the view that they are trying strenuously to discourage people from smoking because they are supporting advertising <e> <s> at least be honest about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are all grateful to the noble baroness for having raised this very important subject today <e> <s> she has certainly demonstrated that the major cities of our country face a formidable range and complexity of problems <e> <s> these problems have to be confronted at a time when the major cities are losing population are skimped of resources and are replete with unemployment and also worrying social and racial disturbances <e> <s> just today the <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister leaves that point perhaps i could ask him a question <e> <s> as regards enterprise zones one of the matters with which people are concerned is that of the levy which in an enterprise zone they cannot pay to the industrial training boards and are not allowed to <e> <s> but at the same time they do not receive a grant if they want to send someone for industrial training <e> <s> this has caused a great deal of disquiet among local authorities industries and other people <e> <s> i wonder whether the government will see this is straightened out <e> <s> it has been raised before <e>", "<cs> my lords interested though i was by the ministers gracious little speech about housing may i ask whether he is aware when he talks about the waiting lists and agrees with my noble friend lord molloy that they are not always accurate that the ama has estimated the shortage of dwellings by taking not just the waiting list but also the number of houses which are in short supply and the number of people who are really in need as being in <e> <s> at the present rate of performance this shortage will rise to in <e> <s> is the noble lord the minister further aware as i am sure he is that in spite of what he was saying generally about housing imbalance council housing cannot really be expanded when according to the governments expenditure white paper there will be a per cent <e> <s> housing cut between and <e>", "<cs> because the question was my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect may i draw the noble lords attention to the fact that the question related to council houses <e> <s> i was keeping to the question <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that we on this side are pleased to hear him make <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister bear in mind that the standard which has been laid down is that there should be six acres of recreational or free ground for every people in the population <e> <s> if the minister accepts that this is so and i gather this is a generally accepted doctrine will he not go back to my noble friends original question which was to encourage local authorities not to sell off playgrounds and open spaces since particularly around urban areas this means even more crowding and far less open space which is detrimental to the social life of the community <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank the minister for his full exposition of this bill and if i may apologise if i cannot be here at the end of the proceedings depending on the time as i have a longstanding engagement which i have explained to the minister <e> <s> i hope we will finish in time because i would very much like to hear the winding-up speeches <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord give way <e> <s> of course he is right when he says that every government is accused of taking away autonomy most governments do take a bit away and give a bit <e> <s> this is quite a different case and i think he must look at it in the same way as the noble lord lord hill did as something quite out of the ordinary <e> <s> this is a whole sequence of provisions destroying the independence of local government <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to hold up the minister at this stage but he surely must agree that local government has never been squeezed so dry of funds from the centre as at the moment <e> <s> this is why these things are happening <e> <s> there may be some irresponsible people but that is not the basis of the whole story <e> <s> they are completely squeezed <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first congratulate the noble lord lord vaizey on bringing forward to this house a bill on such a very important subject <e> <s> it is something which has been going on over many years i suppose one could say decades and which still urgently needs attention <e> <s> the bills objectives are not only admirable but absolutely necessary <e> <s> i know from personal experience from having been a minister at the department of the environment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord leaves that may i just say that in clause of the bill where it lists the cases of expenses it includes the right of the owner to make representations <e>", "<cs> i have listened very carefully to what the minister said <e> <s> he raised a lot of questions himself the needs allowance how it would affect widows and so on <e> <s> there are many other questions that could be raised <e> <s> what is important if this amendment is going to be taken back and looked at is that the way it is drafted at the moment is not very equitable <e> <s> the question is how it can be made more equitable even though the minister raised a number of points and different arguments that should be looked at <e> <s> it seems to us exactly as my noble friend said in moving the amendment that the bill is not right as it is <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the minister thought his noble friend lord mottistone was such a help to him <e> <s> it seemed to me that he was not <e> <s> he called this a wrecking amendment <e> <s> i do not think that the noble lord can have read it very carefully because the amendment makes it quite clear that this is in order to raise revenue to meet expenditure incurred or to be incurred in the exercise of powers under section of the local government act measures with respect to emergencies or disasters or under the riot damages act <e> <s> i shall not read any more of the amendment because i am sure that the noble lord will have great pleasure in reminding himself of it when he reads it <e>", "<cs> of course it was a squeeze then and it was tied to the national economy as it is now <e> <s> but since then we have had cuts on that cut <e> <s> local authorities today are very much worse off <e> <s> if he can do so let the minister tell me where services have not been cut almost to the bare bone the education services the social services <e> <s> let him try to prove that they were worse off in those days than they are today <e> <s> it is getting worse and worse <e> <s> the noble lord knows that as well as i do <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies to the debate i should like to thank him for that very generous apology <e> <s> i know that he always does all he can to help <e> <s> but of course as he perhaps appreciates when you are in opposition and amendments go down late you do not have at your disposal the resources of a great department that you would have when in <e>", "<cs> the temperature goes down enormously directly you return to differential super holdbacks and things like that <e> <s> it is very much more interesting to talk in a wider cosmos of events than on this but this is what the amendment is about <e> <s> it is true that the secretary of state went back on the differential super holdback because he conceded that local authorities should have some certainty about grants especially if they lost the power to levy supplementary rates <e> <s> when we spoke about the past clawbacks and so on it was always in the context of authorities being able to levy supplementary rates if they wished to do so <e> <s> the fact that very often they did not do so is quite another matter <e> <s> to know that you have an opportunity is one thing but not to have it at all is entirely different <e> <s> even now without the super holdback it still legalises a differential holdback by way of a system of expenditure targets and grant penalties <e> <s> but the rules must be known before the start of the year so that the local authority can rate accordingly <e>", "<cs> the noble minister has concentrated on the question of when where and how the government will come to some conclusion on the domestic or general rating system on its abolition or whatever <e> <s> but this is not the whole point of the amendment <e> <s> we can go back to what the noble lords right honourable friend said it is true it was then in the context of a referendum but he knows as well as i do that the whole thing was to deal with the question of authorities raising supplementary rates either through a referendum <e>", "<cs> before i decide may i say that i appreciate that the minister is trying to be helpful and is always ready to talk <e> <s> but i must get this really clear because i do not want to do him an injustice nor do i or my noble frineds want to assume something which is misleading <e> <s> if he is saying that he will be happy to continue just talking to me about it in a rather philosophical way that is one thing <e> <s> but if he is saying that the government are still prepared to think about a limitation of a year that is another <e> <s> if he cannot say that there is really room for consideration of this matter then i really must divide the committee <e> <s> i do not want to do it but i must have a little more than what he has just said although he said it with his usual courtesy and in a very pleasant way <e> <s> but this is a very important and practical point <e>", "<cs> we seem to be coming to the end of a long debate on this subject <e> <s> the outstanding matters that concern us on this side of the committee are the question of what i would call the one-way democracy that rates can be lowered but cannot be increased even if a party has a manifesto to do so the question of the retrospective attitude in respect not only of bedfordshire but of anywhere else if the noble lord so wishes and the whole question of appeals that it would now have to go to the high court and what was found was pointed out by my noble friend lord bruce over the <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble baroness lady stedman in what she said on both the amendment and clause stand part <e> <s> the minister is uite right in saying that we had a debate on the earlier amendment that i moved but the present amendment involves a slightly different approach to the matter and perhaps the minister will consider that it has a greater attraction for him and for the government since it would involve a statutory instrument rather than legislation having to be renewed each year <e> <s> the amendment makes a very specific suggestion <e> <s> it lays down a way of dealing with the matter <e> <s> it makes it quite clear that the statutory instrument would have to be approved by resolution of the house of commons <e> <s> it proposes the use of the statutory instrument which is a much less cumbersome way of doing things than having to bring in new legislation in order to change or get away from old legislation <e>", "<cs> i listened very carefully to what the noble lord lord mottistone said and what the minister said in reply <e> <s> indeed from the reply the noble lord lord mottistone might have felt that perhaps he should have supported the amendments moved from my bench and also by the alliance relating to considering the bill and reassessing the legislation every year in relation to this part of the bill as well <e> <s> the government would have had a chance to look at it and it would also have furthered the noble lords case as regards the government getting on with their assessment of what local financial policy should be <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord bruce was making a relevant point not a political speech because when he spoke of the credit-worthiness of local authorities he was pointing out that because one of their revenue-making possibilities is being taken from them they cannot levy supplementary rates people who are in a position to lend them money are becoming scared <e> <s> that is why the provision was in the bill and has now been polished up a little by the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> in other words it is not so much his amendment against which we are arguing he has made it neater and more polished but the original clause and my noble friend was right in what he said about that <e>", "<cs> from what the noble lord lord evans said about his amendment and reading from it he is saying that the central government are now tying down local authorities so strictly so far as expenditure is concerned and certainly so far as any increases in expenditure are concerned that he is worried about the level of services that some authorities <e>", "<cs> i thought the idea was that the amendments were being grouped together <e> <s> perhaps we can find another copy of the grouping list which seems to have disappeared <e> <s> in moving amendment no <e> <s> i should like to speak to no <e> <s> as well because no <e> <s> paves the way to no <e>", "<cs> i am going to have the temerity to move them because they are in my name and that of my noble friend <e> <s> if the noble lord agrees amendments nos <e> <s> and are very much on the same lines <e> <s> if he does not agree with me perhaps he will interrupt me now <e> <s> i am moving amendment no <e> <s> if he will agree and speaking to amendment no <e> <s> as well <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i am following the suggestion which we received this afternoon from the government side <e> <s> as amendment no <e> <s> is very similar to amendment no <e> <s> it seemed to me that it would save some time if i spoke to them both <e> <s> i shall speak very briefly as the noble lord lord evans of claughton has covered the ground <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies i think that we ought to get something clear now <e> <s> are the government going to put down amendments to clause or not <e> <s> during his second reading speech the minister after referring to part i then said on part ii that the government would possibly be bringing forward amendments <e> <s> earlier this afternoon when i complained about the lateness of the putting down of amendments that we were discussing today i asked the minister whether any amendments that were going to be put down to clause would be put down in plenty of time <e> <s> at that point i must confess that i did not think that we would get as far as we have got this evening <e>", "<cs> may i come in on a point of the substance of these amendments <e> <s> there is a tremendous difference <e> <s> my noble friend the opposition chief whip <e>", "<cs> i think that the ministers reply was very unsatisfactory <e> <s> while his nostalgia is rather charming and enchanting in a way it is getting rather ragged because we hear it all the time <e> <s> i feel almost back in the old days when the noble lord speaks but it really is not good enough to answer always on that same note because we are all aware and he knows just as well as anybody else here even better that circumstances have changed and demands on local authorities have changed <e> <s> there have been demographic changes all sorts of changes and now the local authorities are being strangled to such a degree that it is very difficult for them <e>", "<cs> i can be brief because the noble lord lord evans and the noble baroness lady stedman described the situation fully <e> <s> i too took part in the discussion of this subject when the measure was going through and i have also been in correspondence about it with the minister and the parish councils association <e> <s> whether or not the minister finds the proposal of the noble lord lord evans workable is one thing but not to be able to find a way round the problem perhaps by adopting an entirely different approach seems strange <e> <s> i appreciate that it is a difficult problem but it should be possible to overcome it if necessary by adopting a totally revolutionary approach <e> <s> i am really asking the minister whether if he cannot accept the new clause and of course it is up to the noble lord lord evans to decide what to do about that he can offer any hope perhaps at a later stage in the bill of dealing with what is a knotty <e>", "<cs> in speaking to this amendment i am as was the noble viscount in moving it speaking really to the group because i think the point here is the principle involved <e> <s> i am not at this moment concerned particularly with the final number of members of the commission or indeed whether it should be left to the lord chancellor to make the appointments <e> <s> we have some amendments later on which my noble friend will be moving proposing a different number and a slightly different approach but i think that the concern of the committee this afternoon and this is not confined as one can see immediately to any political party is the basic principle of the independence of this commission <e> <s> i think that most of us here do not like this commission anyhow but if provision for it is to he in the bill and if it is to become part of the legislation on the statute book then we should look at how it is to be composed <e>", "<cs> when the minister addressed himself to this amendment i think that he also addressed himself though not in such depth to amendment no <e> <s> to which my noble friend spoke at the same time <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> and go together and they are two halves of the same amendment <e> <s> as regards amendment no <e> <s> there is certainly room for disagreement about the numbers <e> <s> speaking personally i think that five to seven is rather on the small side <e> <s> on this occasion i agree very much more with the noble lord lord mottistone <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the deputy chairman has put the question that clause shall stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> i must apologise to the committee but my noble friend lord bruce of donington and i got rather mixed up over who moved the last amendment when it came to the reply <e>", "<cs> i am not quite sure what the minister meant <e> <s> i do not know what he was talking about in his last sentence <e> <s> i did not hear what he said <e>", "<cs> i was listening very carefully <e> <s> it may be i did not hear quite what the noble lord said i did not hear the last comment about another place <e> <s> when he says that the commission will not be the tool of the secretary of state and compares it with the district auditors and their independence there was nothing as far as i am aware that ties up with what is now in schedule paragraph <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that careful and full reply <e> <s> the trouble is that one is caught between the devil and the deep over this matter <e> <s> one is trying to find some flexibility and one is left only with one long stop which is the secretary of state and so one goes back to him <e> <s> i am trying to find some way of getting some sort of movement <e> <s> i can see that this amendment will not progress <e> <s> i accept that there are some points against the amendment <e> <s> but i wonder whether between now and the next stage we can try to find a different way round this very difficult and important problem <e> <s> i do not think that this is the way in any case it is quite clear that the minister will not accept this amendment <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> no they are not moved <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank the noble earl lord avon for his lucid explanation of these regulations <e> <s> we on this side of the house have always opposed fees since we believe that planning is a community service which controls the use of land and buildings in the interests of the community and of other individuals therefore it has always seemed wrong to us that individuals should pay directly rather than through the government be it central or local <e> <s> these matters of principle were discussed during the passage of the local government planning and land act and when we divided on this matter in this house a number of noble lords opposite joined us in the division lobby <e> <s> as this instrument has been passed already by the commons i shall not seek to divide the house this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i say this <e> <s> i am afraid that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first very much welcome the amendments that have been moved by the noble lord the minister and also the very clear and nicely brief way in which he explained them <e> <s> in committee i and a number of my noble friends and also noble lords from all parts of the house raised questions relating particularly to pop festivals and other aspects <e> <s> it is true that as was recognised there is a problem here that while one wanted to be able to give a certain amount of freedom to those wanting to indulge in pop festivals or other gatherings we felt that there should also be some form of control <e> <s> i think the amendments moved by the minister cover very adequately the points raised <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself in sympathy with what the noble lord lord evans has said on this <e> <s> in the earlier discussions in committee we were often in danger as many of us pointed out of bringing in in this bill which is a local government miscellaneous provisions bill the type of legislation which if people want it ought to be part of general public legislation and go through parliament on its own and be argued out strongly and in detail and not be hitched on to what is a local government miscellaneous provisions bill <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a complicated point <e> <s> i too was hoping that the noble earl would be able to explain it in greater detail if the noble lord lord nugent of guildford had been here <e> <s> it seems to me that it would go against the ministers arguments on the last amendment moved by the noble earl and i apologise for the fact that i failed to take the opportunity to congratulate him and the government on a very clear statement on relevant locality something that we tried to get clarified all the way through the committee stage <e> <s> if we are to bring in sex cinemas and try to differentiate them from cinemas showing x films and i was not aware that it was not possible to make this differentiation then there seems to be some confusion <e> <s> i am not clear why on this particular amendment a sex cinema should not be taken out or pinpointed as a particular cinema which would be quite different from the ones about which the noble lord was speaking which are showing ordinary films and he pointed out the cinemas and those odeons or whatever showing x films <e> <s> i am afraid that i still find it not altogether clear <e>", "<cs> my lords the same point struck me <e> <s> to save time i was waiting to hear what the minister had to say <e> <s> it is not a question of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say i do not really feel that the ministers explanation though very clear is entirely satisfactory <e> <s> i support the noble lord lord nugent of guildford on this for if one looks at paragraph it refers only to the grant renewal or transfer <e> <s> it does not refer to what the noble lord has put in his amendment which is <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the minister will accept this increase <e> <s> several of us spoke about it during the committee stage <e> <s> this is rather a different category of offence from the amendment moved by the noble lord lord robertson of oakridge <e> <s> the point we were concerned with there was the employment of somebody which comes into line with employment in public houses or other places <e> <s> but this is a straight fine for any offence under the licensing act or whatever it turns out to be <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord nugent of guildford that because of the amount of money which changes hands in this business a fine of cannot be sufficient <e> <s> this will be a maximum fine <e> <s> therefore the courts will have an opportunity to go very much lower than that <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that although it is thought that magistrates courts cannot go beyond this is not so <e> <s> there have been exceptions in the past bringing it up to <e> <s> because of inflation looking to the future i should have thought that was a reasonable compromise for there will not be a rapid change unless these fines are indexed <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support the noble lord lord nugent of guildford in this amendment <e> <s> i will not go over the arguments which he has put so clearly but this amendment really does make sense and is much more consistent and logical <e> <s> in view of the fact that it has now been decided by the government to accept the other increase to a maximum fine of for obstructing a police officer on official duties does seem financially rather weedy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not going to enter into the point raised by my noble friend although i <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the minister something before he sits down <e> <s> he said in his reply that the department of health together with the health and safety executive are going to work out the guidelines <e> <s> he also said if i heard him correctly that it is quite difficult to get that right and obviously i can disagree with none of that <e> <s> therefore it seems to me that it would be very much simpler to give local authorities power in this bill to make by-laws so that premises would be registered rather than try to work out guidelines <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that finding the right guidelines is a very complicated operation <e> <s> what i have in mind is more direct and simpler and would give great opportunities for controls <e> <s> i fail to see why the more difficult path of the guidelines should be <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend lord molloy for his support and i am sorry that the minister was not persuaded by me and has not been persuaded by my noble friend <e> <s> this is not a matter on which i feel i should divide the house at this stage even though i consider that the position is unsatisfactory <e> <s> i feel that after fashions or fads have been popular <e>", "<cs> no my lords on the contrary i welcome the clarification <e> <s> i shall be able to show this section of the bill when it becomes law to my grandchildren and say look this explanation of what is meant by a person who hawks food was what your grandmother managed to get on to the statute book <e> <s> i am perfectly happy with it it was just that earlier the matter was left rather in the air <e> <s> the phrase is rather unwieldy but since this is not an exercise in literature i think that we have to leave it at that <e> <s> but i do welcome the clarification <e>", "<cs> my lords there was one point i did not quite follow and it is a point on which and i think the house would be very grateful to have clarification on <e> <s> the noble lord was referring to notices in the street <e> <s> i was referring to the point of correspondence being addressed to occupier <e> <s> i do not mind it being addressed to the owner and occupier as i gather it is precedented and my noble friend on my left assures me that it is legally more correct to have owner and occupier <e> <s> i do not quite follow this business about the street <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble earl thought we just wanted to hand out leaflets or something in the street <e> <s> i wanted to make quite sure that although it may be addressed to owner and occupier one would not have to seek out the owner necessarily but that it could refer to the person who was occupying the premises <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble earl would clarify that because it might save a lot of trouble later <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of that as we come back to the original amendment and as this is now part of the law and as long as it works in practice in the way i have described i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lady fisher i thank the minister for bringing forward the amendment which she originally moved <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the government will look carefully at what my noble friend lady david said <e> <s> i am rather puzzled by the ministers remarks because even today the magistrates courts do not deal solely with criminal cases all sorts of summonses can be taken out in the magistrates court and i recollect that in order to relieve the burden on the county courts and crown courts magistrates courts were asked where appropriate to take what they could <e> <s> i should have thought that a matter such as this would be worth examining to see whether something could be done <e>", "<cs> my lords at this time of night i should like only very briefly to support the amendment just moved by the noble viscount lord ridley <e> <s> as he said it is designed to achieve simplicity and efficiency <e> <s> it makes absolute sense <e> <s> the district councils are not responsible for advertisement control in the national parks the national parks authorities are themselves responsible for that and therefore it is only logical they should be responsible for the physical removal of any offending advertisements <e> <s> it seems to be a simple straightforward amendment <e> <s> the noble viscount very effectively covered almost every point concerned with cost personnel and the way that the matter should be handled and i hope that the minister will find it possible to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble minister will accept this proposal although it was turned down in committee <e> <s> i think my noble friend lady ewartbiggs has made a very convincing case which frankly seems to me absolutely unanswerable <e> <s> it has been accepted that authorities should have the power to remove placards or posters and once that has been given we really ought to include any other thing of this sort in the same section <e> <s> as my noble friend has said the spray painting very often produces the most offensive horrible and obscene messages on walls of buildings even on churches and synagogues <e> <s> it has become a favourite practice of the national front to use this way of public communication <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister answers may i underline a point made by my noble friend <e> <s> one accepts that an authority has to try to find out who is responsible but reasonable inquiry can involve a very long delay indeed until everybody has forgotten all about it even though the placard or poster remains <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister would agree that together with this amendment it will be important to incorporate in a circular to local authoriities that reasonable inquiry should not be protracted into a long delay <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends have explained what the benefits of this amendment would be <e> <s> although the government turned down a rather similar amendment in committee i think there are several reasons why they should think again tonight <e> <s> first they have had more time to think about the advantages of an amendment of this kind and the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am slightly taken by surprise <e> <s> i had rather hoped that the eec statement would intervene between the ministers speech and my speech <e> <s> at the very welcome initiative of the noble lord lord kearton we have this afternoon the opportunity of discussing the report on <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his careful reply <e> <s> may i say that if there are technical faults in the drafting i am sorry about that but obviously i cannot deal with that at this stage <e> <s> what is more important is the principle involved the principle being that there is an area of uncertainty and we are left with the position where dlos can face closure if they are considered unprofitable <e> <s> there is the element of uncertainty where the secretary of state according to my interpretation of the circular can assess the impact and has to look at the position in each case <e> <s> i can only return to what i said when moving the amendment which is that frankly my noble friends and i and from what the noble lord lord evans has said he seems to be in agreement and i am also grateful for the interjection by the noble lord lord sandford believe that this is too vague <e> <s> the minister agreed about the whole question of employment for young persons and the terrible unemployment that exists at this moment <e> <s> to leave this in what i think is far too vague a situation is something that we should not do when we are at the moment considering a piece of legislation which it should be part of and in which it would have a very good position <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mottistone is of course right <e> <s> i was trying to say that it takes less and less time to fly from one place to another <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the minister for his reply and his clarification of this matter <e> <s> i am still worried by the point made in the reply the letter from councillor emmerson to the minister when he says <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first join in the thanks from all sides of the house to the government for having made the changes which were asked for as far as debate was concerned in the unstarred question asked by my noble friend lord northfield on i think th march the day the consultation paper came out <e> <s> from all sides of the house i think i had better exclude the noble lord lord mottistone because i would not want to slander him in this way if he took a different view which he probably did we were appalled at the proposal then of the p rate for industry <e>", "<cs> that is right p or whichever is the higher <e> <s> i do not think that anybody is going to be in the area of such big business that they could create any competitive problems with some of the larger businesses covered by the cbi <e> <s> this is still fairly small stuff in the industrial field <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right and i was aware of that <e> <s> i thought i had covered that in my point about the co-operation between local authorities and also the opportunity that this type of partnership could give to people who probably would not even get their small businesses started or under way or who want help <e> <s> it is also a way as we pointed out in our previous debates on this matter of using buildings shops empty buildings in local authority areas where again this is of great importance <e>", "<cs> my lords for one moment it seemed to me that the minister was agreeing entirely and then he seemed to go off the idea altogether <e> <s> it sounded as if he was himself in a slight dichotomy <e> <s> my noble friend quite rightly and very lucidly made the point about the dangers that would be encompassed if the proposed clause went too wide <e> <s> however he was also good enough to mention a very strict limitation to which i had referred and to which the amendment itself refers <e> <s> if the minister looks at subsection of the new clause he will see that it is drafted in what i might call severe terms <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of that rather mysterious answer i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with great pleasure that from these benches and my colleagues are with us in spirit even if they are not here in the flesh i rise to support the bill <e> <s> although it is quite a small bill it was so well explained by the noble lord lord sandford when he moved it that much time and trouble will be saved by our not needing to go over it all again <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment moved by the noble viscount lord ridley <e> <s> it is quite a small amendment but it is an important one because it would leave rather more flexibility but without opening the gates entirely <e> <s> in view of the different circumstances that can arise in various authorities the term may recommend seems to be much more sensible than the term shall prescribe <e> <s> there is also the rather more complicated problem where there is an extraordinary audit under the bill the secretary of state would retain a power to direct an extraordinary audit if it were desirable in the public interest <e> <s> the amendments allow the authority to choose its auditor from the approved list maintained by the commission and the commission would be able to recommend rather than order the scale of fees <e> <s> i should have thought that there would be an advantage for the commission because there must be occasions when it would prefer to give this kind of balanced advice rather than acting in a very sharp and perhaps restrictive manner <e>", "<cs> this argument seems to me to be quite extraordinary <e> <s> i would call it almost a belt and braces job <e> <s> the secretary of state is setting up an audit commission which is to be given the widest strongest and deepest powers that one could imagine and now to be superimposed are the secretary of states extra powers <e> <s> it seems to me to he both unnecessary and quite wrong <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble viscounts amendment <e> <s> this is moving towards doing away with the independence of this allegedly independent commission which is due to be set up even before it has been set up <e> <s> as the noble viscount said if it is to be independent it must be treated as such and must be given a certain amount of responsibility it must receive the respect due to a commission in which the secretary of state and everybody else has some trust and some belief <e> <s> this amendment was proposed in conjunction with the previous amendments which unfortunately we did not get the government to accept substituting recommending for prescribing that has now gone <e>", "<cs> i think the minister was if i may say so a little unfair in describing what i was saying as being immoderate <e> <s> if he takes it in the context of setting up an audit commission that is quite different from the situation which i know has existed for some years in which the secretary of state has this power we are discussing this now in the context of an independent high-powered audit commission <e> <s> either they should be taking on this job or the secretary of <e>", "<cs> i must at this stage accept what the minister has said because in fact the amendment is rather the wrong way round but we cannot help that <e> <s> it would have been helpful if we could have discussed clause and then taken what i call the fall-back position afterwards <e> <s> in view of that and in the interests of time which is passing rapidly i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the minister starts are we really discussing h <e> <s> it relates to an entirely new clause which i should have thought would be taken on its own <e> <s> it comes after clause <e> <s> i think we are going to get into a muddle if we discuss that <e> <s> it is not just odd things and consequentials it is an important clause on its own <e> <s> the feeling of the committee may be that we should discuss that on its own <e>", "<cs> i support the noble viscount lord ridley on wishing to delete clause <e> <s> he is absolutely right to say that the powers in the clause are extremely wide-ranging and to allow such powers to be in the hands of the secretary of state or the quango the audit commission is pushing the tolerance of local government beyond the limit <e> <s> nobody disputes the capability of auditors to look at the question of economy in the provision of services but efficiency and effectiveness are two concepts which differ from economy they are not the same thing at all because they involve the making of value judgments <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i might ask the minister a question on that <e> <s> how does he then answer the warning that mr maynard gives that <e>", "<cs> we have to remember that shall rather than may follows on from clause <e> <s> as we have been unable to change the shall to may there it follows that in this clause the commission must follow up the impact of the operation of any particular statutory provision and this is very important of any directions or guidance given by a minister of the crown <e> <s> it follows that whatever a minister of the crown deems to be a direction or guidance must be the object of such a study whether or not that is the purpose of the particular direction or guidance <e> <s> there is a danger that if this new clause is initiated with a duty rather than a power it could be used to reintroduce political direction of the commission merely by designating the purpose of directions or guidance so as to achieve economy efficiency and effectiveness <e>", "<cs> i really am extremely worried about this because it seems to me that the minister has said two different things <e> <s> i understood him to say that the amendment moved by the noble viscount was not necessary because the matter was covered by subsection which says that no information shall be provided by the comptroller and auditor-general in respect of any particular body <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that the noble lord lord bellwin said that this subsection covered it <e>", "<cs> but then the noble lord went on to say that the comptroller and auditor-general has <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is perfectly true that we had an earlier debate on this matter but i cannot let the amendment pass without making a comment on the objectionable nature of the schedule <e> <s> the point about it is that it is retrospective <e> <s> it spells out what we discussed in clause on the supplementary rate <e> <s> in paragraph of the new schedule it is made quite clear that <e>", "<cs> i did not find that reply very satisfactory mainly because the minister has not agreed with me <e> <s> the provision reserves the secretary of states extensive powers of direction over the commission and once again it reflects seriously on the integrity of the commission and calls into question its true independence <e> <s> if the government wanted to demonstrate the good faith of the secretary of state they would remove these further inhibitions on the commission and allow it to exercise some real independence <e> <s> however i should like to read what the minister has said and see whether i can write to him a persuasive letter <e> <s> in the meantime in view of the thinness of the committee i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendments of the noble viscount because they are practical and sensible <e> <s> the first amendment amendment no <e> <s> seeks to specify a fixed term of office for <e>", "<cs> i did not intend to speak but with great respect the minister was talking quite a lot of light-hearted nonsense <e> <s> sometimes he looked quite amused at what he was reading out himself <e> <s> i am not really surprised <e> <s> on the first amendment the noble viscount has not taken away the right of appointment by the minister <e> <s> i understand the secretary of state appoints members of the commission and all the noble viscount is saying is for a period of three years <e> <s> the minister said supposing somebody wants to stay for only two years <e> <s> they resign <e> <s> this is usual <e> <s> you appoint people for three years five years or whatever and the usual appointments nowadays are for three years <e> <s> this is a normal function <e>", "<cs> i am not going to use any words like that <e> <s> i am just going to ask this <e> <s> if i go into the peers bar here and i am landed with a plate of scrambled eggs which i do not want i do not like them and i do not want to eat them is it fair that i should be asked to pay for them when i have not even wanted to participate in the eating of them <e> <s> if the minister could show that local authorities were all in favour of the audit commission and that their associations thought it was the best thing for local authorities then there would be some substance in the argument <e> <s> but to impose something on them and then on top of that say you will now pay for something you do not like seems to me to be quite outrageous <e> <s> this is just a simple question <e> <s> it is not semantics or jargon or anything fancy like that <e>", "<cs> i did not order them they were handed to me <e>", "<cs> as this is the theme of clause and time is going on and since we seemed to have entered into a general debate on the clause rather than wait for amendment no <e> <s> to be moved by the noble lord the minister it might be better to enter the general debate on clause <e> <s> this has had a very chequered history <e> <s> i do not know whether this is the last of it because i would imagine that the government might have to come back on report with other amendments <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble viscount that this clause seems to be doomed to procedural muddles as well as everything else but now that we are on the clause and it is being spoken to i must say a brief word about it <e> <s> after a great deal of what frankly has been messing around the government have come up with wording that is quite contrary to what they said they intended to do <e> <s> the amendment is designed to enable the government to keep their promise to exempt certain exceptional payments from the financial penalties scheme that the bill will otherwise introduce but it would restore to the secretary of state all the sweeping powers that he had originally sought to take away grant from particular authorities at any time during the year on a penalty basis discriminating between local authorities <e> <s> it is impossible to let the occasion pass without saying this and without pointing out that the amendment would negate the promises made by ministers during the earlier stages of the bill a long time back at the beginning of this year <e> <s> nevertheless this has happened <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support what the minister has said on these amendments <e> <s> i have some sympathy with the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords on reflection perhaps it was a mistake that we gave permission to the noble lord lord elton to speak on the two amendments together because although the amendments are similar in wording as i think the noble lord lord nugent and my noble friend lord houghton have already pointed out they are in application completely different <e> <s> the one referring to schedule to entertainment is something which we are used to we are used to the giving of licences for entertainment by local authorities drink entertainment dance entertainment this is something we are quite used to <e> <s> the question of enforcement also applies in quite different ways <e> <s> when we come to schedule on sex <e>", "<cs> my lords i am conscious of the fact that our scots colleagues are waiting to come on for the next business and i will be brief <e> <s> i think that this has been a generally good bill <e> <s> it has covered a very wide area <e> <s> it has gone from sex shops open-air events fly-posting schedules and and their problems with drafting lost property trespass on school property and all these have had some results coming from them <e> <s> another big problem about the bill has been the speed it has been taken through this house <e> <s> even this morning the noble earl lord avon arrived personally with a letter for me in response to something which was raised on report <e> <s> i do not blame him at all <e> <s> i am grateful to him but it was far too late and he appreciated that to be able to do anything about the matter on third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords before this is entirely accepted as it is it seems to me that it is not quite so clear and straightforward as appears <e> <s> there are three questions i should like to ask the minister which i think should be cleared up <e> <s> first of all on the question of definition who is to say what are the increased costs incurred by the rating authority in issuing a revised rate as a result of a substituted precept <e> <s> secondly how are the administrative expenses going to be defined <e> <s> that is rather a wide phrase <e> <s> then it would seem to me there is a problem in disentangling the rates and the precepts <e> <s> for instance what happens when both the rate made for the district councils own purposes and the precept are substituted <e> <s> how will the extra costs be apportioned <e>", "<cs> returning to a more local matter my lords i am speaking following the ministers reply to my moving of amendment no <e> <s> and i must at the outset apologise for omitting to say that it would he convenient to discuss at the same time amendment no <e> <s> and manuscript amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> i do not think that omission on my part caused the minister any difficulty because we have an agreed grouping of amendments <e> <s> no <e> <s> seeks the deletion of schedule and the manuscript amendment is necessary because a small subsection which was overlooked must be deleted if schedule is to be removed <e>", "<cs> my lords i think there is a certain amount of merit in this amendment because as the minister pointed out there has been a problem in some enterprise zones where factories have straddled boundaries <e> <s> reaching agreement on the amount of relief if any for these straddling hereditaments has it is true become a problem albeit a minor problem and this amendment i think quite sensibly leaves it to the judgment of the valuation officer <e> <s> this seems to make more sense <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister started off by saying on amendment no <e> <s> that the government had made the postion quite clear <e> <s> it was not clear <e> <s> there were a number of points that i the noble viscount lord ridley and my noble friend lord bruce raised <e> <s> it was put to the minister that it would be better to come back on third reading <e> <s> what we meant was that the amendment would not be accepted but would be brought forward in a clearer form on third reading <e> <s> he grasped that branch and said he would like to explain it on third reading <e> <s> that itself was not good enough <e>", "<cs> my lords out of this group of amendments to which i spoke originally and to which the minister has replied by far the most important is the amendment which i moved namely amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> at the end of the committee stage we had a very general discussion on what was the old clause <e> <s> clause was dealt with separately because it appeared so late <e> <s> the answers given then were very unsatisfactory <e> <s> there was a great deal of disquiet about the exemptions which were proposed by the government to alter clause <e> <s> much as we disliked clause originally we disliked even more the amendments put forward by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment which has just been moved by the noble lord lord evans <e> <s> it is this wretched retrospection which is again involved and very clearly so <e> <s> by accepting this amendment retrospection would be taken out of part ii <e> <s> at present we have it running through part i and part ii <e> <s> this is all that the amendment seeks to do <e> <s> i would add my plea to that of the noble lord lord evans that the government give this amendment a favourable hearing <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the time and the chief whips beady eye on me and so that i can look at it again i beg leave to withdraw this amendment in order to have a chance to think about it and perhaps take it further on third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i moved a similar amendment in committee and the minister undertook to look into the matter and to produce an amendment <e> <s> i am very grateful to him because this amendment does meet the point entirely <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put a question on that <e> <s> at the committee stage when we discussed this and i cannot remember whether it was the old clause or the next one which is now clause the minister said that the new clause does not make the local authorities accountable to parliament <e> <s> later he said that the local authorities had nothing to lose from being identified in the commissions report <e> <s> i raised this point myself and i pointed out that the minister appeared to have made some contradictory statements <e> <s> we were left unsure whether the local authorities would be identified or whether if they were identified there was any harm in it <e> <s> i think there were two different points <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to press this amendment to a division because it would be futile at this time of night <e> <s> i hold different views about this <e> <s> i am not against the commission undertaking studies but i am still against the word shall <e> <s> with great respect it is not true that they will have the opportunity to choose <e> <s> because of the way it is written it follows that whatever a minister of the crown deems to be a direction or guidance to those ends must be the object of such a study whether or not that is the purpose of the particular direction or guidance <e> <s> this is the way in which it can most certainly be interpreted <e>", "<cs> my lords unless i have got it wrong this is not as simple as the minister has made it sound <e> <s> this is an addition to schedule and therefore it is connected with the whole bedfordshire case <e> <s> what it appears to be doing is relaxing the requirement to make a substituted rate where a precept has been made for less than a financial year <e> <s> parish councils do actually precept on rating authorities <e> <s> i dare to presume that a parish council in bedfordshire has actually done this <e> <s> i would like to know from the minister what the reason is for this particular amendment <e> <s> is it connected with a particular case of a parish council in bedfordshire <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble viscount replies saying what he is going to do on this amendment i would say that most certainly we support him <e> <s> as my noble friend lord bruce of donington has explained although our names were not down to the amendment that was probably an oversight with so much to do <e> <s> the ministers reasons again are quite ordinary and usual as they run through the bill in the same way <e> <s> the implication that we might forget that the secretary of state has all these powers if they were not on almost every page and almost every paragraph is really almost laughable if it were not sad <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that until the government give an unequivocal declaration that housing capital allocations will not be further cut in real terms as they have been by nearly per cent <e> <s> since local housing authorities do not feel confident enough in the governments intentions to spend their accumulated capital receipts on such things as rehabilitating empty properties <e> <s> therefore as my noble friend pointed out is not this really a question of adequate housing capital investment and local authorities feeling sure enough about the governments intentions not to put their capital receipts away as the housing minister said the other day in a speech for a rainy day <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in his speech on the th of this month the minister of housing said <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened very carefully to what the minister said <e> <s> he said several times that he and the government listen to what is being said they listen but the trouble is that they do not hear <e> <s> this is the whole point <e> <s> so we go on explaining bringing evidence to bear on all these matters in particular the question of retrospection yet nothing happens <e> <s> my noble friend lord bruce spoke on earlier amendments <e> <s> they were some of the amendments to which i referred and they were much more substantial than the present amendment <e> <s> the minister said that what we propose would increase the amount of administrative work but i would point out to him that the amendment is much slighter than previous amendments that is why i described it as more modest and more reasonable and therefore it would not create the same demand on administration <e> <s> how many authorities would appeal <e> <s> there would not be so many but at least they would be treated justly <e> <s> only those authorities that are affected by the penalties would be involved not all of them would appeal <e> <s> we have restricted the amendment in that way in order to make it a rather more attractive proposition <e> <s> the minister asked why not widen it further <e> <s> but it does not seem that it would make very much difference <e>", "<cs> my lords when this bill came to this house from another place some two months ago it seemed to me to my colleagues on the benches behind me and to colleagues in the liberal party and the sdp that there was an opportunity for this house to prove its worth <e> <s> the minister has just said that we have done a thorough job <e> <s> it may have been a thorough job but certainly the results have been completely sterile <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me to intervene i do not want him to misunderstand me <e> <s> obviously there were points which we accept and i did say so but most of the additions to this bill were introduced by the government and they have not improved it at all <e> <s> i am afraid that i must really stand by that <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to all noble lords who have spoken in support of the amendment the minister and i agree with him said that he agreed with the principle behind the amendment as did the minister in another place <e> <s> he also pointed to the defects in the amendment as it stands at present <e> <s> however i think the minister will agree with me that that is not the important part of it <e> <s> if we are to enter into a discussion of remand centres in prisons and the fact that although they are used they are not remand centres in law there is a danger that we shall get bogged down in semantics <e> <s> that is not the principle which we are discussing <e>", "<cs> i am dividing on this amendment because of the whole principle involved and the approach put forward by the government <e> <s> unless a miracle occurs i do not believe that we are going to win this division but it will at least make the government think and come back with something they themselves have drafted for the bill which would at least meet the very strong feeling expressed around the committee <e> <s> then we would feel that we had achieved something <e>", "<cs> i should like very strongly to support this amendment from these benches <e> <s> i would entirely agree with the noble baroness lady faithfull that most of our interest is in seeing how very much more we could do in the way of non-custodial methods of dealing with crime rather than the custodial methods <e> <s> i think it is perfectly true that there is tremendous danger in what is in fact a good measure of reducing the minimum period at a detention centre from three months to three weeks <e> <s> i can say without any doubt that many benches will use this as a sentence in preference to a non-custodial <e> <s> they will do it from the best of motives and with the best will in the world but it will be a custodial sentence rather than a non-custodial sentence <e> <s> if the minister feels as he may that this is covered quite sufficiently in the bill i entirely agree with the noble lord lord hunt about the word appropriate i would put it to him with great respect that this really is not so <e> <s> we have seen in so many other pieces of legislation not necessarily criminal legislation but others also that these things have been left open and not spelt out in detail and it has caused a great deal of confusion and difficulty <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment moved by the noble baroness <e> <s> it is an interesting and important amendment <e> <s> it is doing something which i hope we will see done in this bill <e> <s> it is bringing something creative and looking towards the future and following a particular philosophy which we try to embody more and more in the field which is to move away from the custodial side into the non-custodial side when dealing with penal offences <e> <s> in this part of the bill where we are dealing with young offenders and juveniles it is appalling to be reminded so many times as we go into these amendments of the rise in the numbers of juveniles going into custody <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord vaizey for raising this very important question in this short debate today <e> <s> i think he did play us all around a bit in some aspects of what he said but he touched on some important points <e> <s> how we must look at this is in the context of the major housing crisis in which we find ourselves <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister a question in which i think the government have a part to play <e> <s> does he not agree that the government should be doing something or looking into doing something to prevent this demolition by stealth which has happened unfortunately many times before <e> <s> it is always outrageous and even more so when carried out by a local authority from which one expects a greater sense of responsibility and civilised behaviour <e>", "<cs> from what the minister has said so far i do not think that he has answered the points which have been raised both by myself and by my noble friends and other noble lords <e> <s> whether when we come to amendment no <e> <s> this will light up the whole question very much better than it is at the moment i do not know but i am doubtful <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> still leaves it to the court to impose these negative requirements and it is the basis of these which the probation officers and the directors of social services among others as well as many magistrates are against <e> <s> i should have thought that the association of directors of social services were aware of amendment no <e> <s> when within the last day or so they sent out their views <e>", "<cs> i also have doubts about this amendment <e> <s> i do see the point put forward by the noble lord lord harris <e> <s> but in the first place do we really want to be as tough with the juveniles and youngsters as we do with adults <e> <s> then i question whether it would in practice serve any useful purpose <e> <s> the situation today is that if the child is brought back to the court under the terms of the supervision order the options open are either to make an order under section of the children and young persons act and/or one can do one or other or both to impose a fine up to or make an attendance centre order <e> <s> incidentally there are more opportunities for attendance centre orders than there are orders made <e> <s> in addition to this the child may have to take part in intermediate treatment activities or comply with other conditions as part of the order <e> <s> in this way the order is not the same as a probation order <e> <s> therefore it would seem to me that it could happen that the child could be punished twice for the offence in addition to being penalised for being in breach of the supervision order <e>", "<cs> i should like to make two points first on the point that has been raised by many noble lords and particularly by my noble friend lord elystan-morgan that it is absolutely essential that local authorities should be given more resources <e> <s> the noble lerd lord digby did not move the amendment in the name of his noble friend lord ridley <e> <s> if he had moved it i should have found myself unable to agree with the local authorities about taking over what i would partly call the decision of the courts <e> <s> nevertheless i would have used the occasion to emphasise the need for resources to be made available to the local authorities so that they can use noncustodial treatment and penalties which are so important <e>", "<cs> i should also like to support this amendment <e> <s> i see that the amendment which follows it is for a review by a body by a committee <e> <s> i very much prefer the amendment now before us to the fallback position which i consider the following amendment to be <e> <s> as the noble baroness has pointed out this amendment would make an annual review mandatory <e> <s> it means that a young child who commits a minor offence and who could be taken away from his parents for say the next eight years if he is without any subsequent independent review of his situation is in a <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to prolong this discussion but it worries me that the minister will keep on putting together the terms community home residential care foster parents and then the childs own home <e> <s> it is very important to differentiate between these things <e> <s> with great respect i think it is quite absurd to pretend that if there is a care order for the child who is residing in its own home with its own family this is on all fours with a child being away in residential accommodation <e> <s> if this is not grasped i do not think we are going to get very far with this <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support what my noble friend and other noble lords have said and emphasise the point made just now by the noble lord lord avebury that the reconviction rate in these cases is so high that that alone should make one wonder about the situation <e> <s> even as recently as two researchers at lancaster university found that two-thirds of the total number of young offenders from rochdale who were placed in custodial homes re-offended <e> <s> that is the latest information that we seem to have had since <e>", "<cs> in the committee stage last week i had the privilege of moving the first amendment which was to stop young offenders from being put into adult prisons on remand in custody <e> <s> i also had the chastening experience of when unfortunately the replies that we received from the government were so unsatisfactory that although we had not intended to divide the committee we did so and therefore at the moment this is still left in the bill <e> <s> i am referring to clause <e>", "<cs> in answer to the noble baronesss question in the long run <e> <s> the minister said yes in the long run could he be a little more specific particularly in view of the answer he gave to the noble baroness lady faithfull <e> <s> it was a point which i also raised when i spoke <e> <s> there should be something more specific than this <e> <s> in the long run sounds to me rather more depressing than we had expected from the answer to the question <e>", "<cs> i know <e>", "<cs> if i understood the noble baroness correctly she appeared to be under the impression that it was the amendment that made the parents pay <e> <s> in fact it is quite the reverse <e> <s> it is in the bill itself that the duty is put on the parents and it is the bill itself that dots the is and crosses the ts which the noble baroness does not like <e> <s> the amendment makes the whole thing very much more flexible and sets out a series of criteria within which the parents should pay <e> <s> i think my noble and learned friend is absolutely right that there are many cases where it would exacerbate tremendously the relationships within the family particularly if they are not very good relationships if this burden is laid legislatively on the <e>", "<cs> we on these benches support wholeheartedly the amendment moved by the noble lord lord hunt <e> <s> i think lord avebury had a point in what he was picking up and the problems that might arise <e> <s> what we are concerned with tonight is really the principle of the whole thing we are discussing the principle of the supervised release scheme and how this should be brought about <e> <s> lord hunt gave us the history of it <e> <s> the noble lord lord campbell said he thought it was the function of the court and judges to decide <e> <s> with great respect i think he is overlooking the fact that as with many things you get attitudes within a society which get built into the society and this is how we get consistency <e> <s> it is also the case that the secretary of state was prepared to bring in the supervised release scheme but as was pointed out by my right honourable friend at second reading in another place this was destroyed not by the judges but by the conservative party conference <e> <s> the labour party has remained constant in its support for the scheme <e>", "<cs> no it was not at that time it was definitely the supervised release scheme <e> <s> there was then the problem of how the judges saw it and as lord hunt explained the lord chief justice explained his reservations in his maiden speech in the house <e> <s> those reservations dealt with the more severe crimes and the problems of dealing with violent and difficult criminals and these have been taken into account and incorporated in lord hunts amendment <e>", "<cs> i wish we could make up our minds on what we are doing <e> <s> we have spent a lot of time considering that matter <e> <s> we could either have been discussing the amendments on parole or be going home <e> <s> if we are just going to have a debate on the debate we might as well pack up <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that one of the committees most important and urgent recommendations was that all professional handlers of hazardous waste outside the place of production must be licensed by their waste disposal authorities <e> <s> can he tell us how soon that very important recommendation is going to be implemented <e>", "<cs> i wish to speak in support of the amendment of my noble friend lord longford <e> <s> i also wish to follow the point made by the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge when he spoke about the lack of hope and the deterioration experienced by the prisoner after a period of years <e> <s> some years ago when i was visiting wormwood scrubs a very tough as he described himself senior prison officer there told me after years any human being starts to deteriorate <e> <s> he said look dont think that im one of your softies or liberals <e> <s> im speaking from my own personal experience as a prison officer and from that moment the person starts to go downhill <e>", "<cs> for certain categories <e> <s> as i am sure she is aware as indeed we are all aware in this country it is in fact very unusual for a life sentence to mean life <e> <s> when the minister replies it would be interesting to hear the figures for people who are serving life other than for murder or manslaughter <e> <s> very often life sentences are given for example in severe cases of arson where even the judge implies that it is necessary for the prisoners case to be kept under review because it is difficult to ascertain in advance whether he will be fit for release at any particular time <e> <s> therefore the importance of a review is very great <e>", "<cs> i beg the noble baronesss pardon <e> <s> they recommend release yes <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord give way for a moment <e> <s> the figures i quoted were between and <e> <s> the abolition of the death penalty could play no part in those years <e>", "<cs> i rise to support my noble friend <e> <s> my name is attached to the amendment <e> <s> may i first refer to the report of the parole board for which acknowledged that <e>", "<cs> we on these benches would very much like to support the amendment moved by the noble baroness <e> <s> the effect of what she explained to us so clearly when she moved the amendment has been a source of great concern and this point was raised several times during the discussions on the various housing bills that have been before us during this period <e> <s> with her i hope that the government will accept something in the nature of a fine which is very much more realistic than what is in existence at present <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord donaldson and standing in my name <e> <s> it seems to me to be a very sensible and practical way of dealing with this very often difficult situation of fining people and getting them to pay the fines <e> <s> in the house of commons expenditure committee in its report <e>", "<cs> if that is so and it appears to be unknown to many of us including even those who sit in court and practice the law and therefore it is obscure it seems important that it should be written into the legislation <e> <s> it is late and we are probably all rather tired but i want to be clear about this <e> <s> is the minister saying that the court can do what the amendment suggests <e> <s> in other words can a court say we should like to make an attachment of earnings order in your case we think that would be the most satisfactory course <e> <s> we just need your consent <e> <s> is that what the minister is saying can now be done <e> <s> is it as clear as that <e>", "<cs> with respect that is ridiculous <e>", "<cs> that puts the court in an unnecessarily silly position <e> <s> it means that the court must say if you will ask us we will do it <e> <s> if the position is as the minister has described why can it not be the other way round it is important for the sake of the authority of the court for the court to have the power to make the decision <e> <s> i should find it most embarrassing to sit as chairman of my court and say if you ask us to do it we will especially as so many defendants are un-represented anyway <e>", "<cs> it is not just semantics <e>", "<cs> he is still alive <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment to which i have my name and which was moved so lucidly and comprehensively by the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington and supported by the noble baroness lady trumpington <e> <s> it is very unfortunately <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i could help the minister and save time <e> <s> i realise that he is now referring to amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> we shall not be moving it <e>", "<cs> it has all become a little confusing now <e> <s> perhaps i can start at the end <e> <s> the reason why my noble friend are not moving amendments nos <e> <s> a and b is that we think on balance the governments amendments are better than those <e> <s> so that is out of the way <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister very much for that very reassuring reply <e> <s> i think what my noble <e>", "<cs> our concern is that there will be some but of course not all mental patients who attend as outpatients who would be quite suitable for attending a day training centre and it would benefit them as well <e> <s> the example i gave was somebody who goes once a month or once every few weeks to a mental hospital for treatment <e> <s> if the person even as an out-patient is not suitable obviously one would not ask for that <e> <s> but as the situation is at the moment i understand that outpatients are excluded from day training centres in the same way as are in-patients <e> <s> of course with in-patients that is understandable but what we are asking for is that out-patients should where it is appropriate have the opportunity to attend the centres <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the support the amendment has received <e> <s> i too found the ministers reply disappointing i would with respect call part of it absolute nonsense when a court sits and decides what it should do with regard to an offender it decides whether it should be a fine probation or whatever <e> <s> even among ourselves at that stage we do not say that if it is to be a three-year order we will put the offender <e>", "<cs> there is no point at this time on a friday afternoon pursuing a matter of this kind <e> <s> we shall certainly return to the subject on report when i am sure there will be even greater support than there has been today if only because there will be more noble lords present <e> <s> i advise the minister to reconsider the matter very carefully because a very good case for what we propose has been made out <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not find the arguments against this amendment very convincing <e> <s> in answer to the noble baroness lady masham i would say of course there are people who as the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge has pointed out do need treatment <e> <s> many do and some of them should be given some form of hospital or residential treatment but it is not going to help them or the people whom they offend by their acts to send them to prison <e> <s> this is the whole point of the amendment <e> <s> there is no need to have given alternatives in this amendment because the alternatives are there <e> <s> the alternatives are there before the court and they do not have to be spelled out in this amendment <e> <s> this amendment seeks to take away one of the alternatives which is sending these people to prison <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt but i am getting quite lost over this <e> <s> it does not refer to the amendment at all <e> <s> the amendment quite specifically states <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry that the minister put forward the arguments which he did in opposing this amendment <e> <s> it is very sad that this age-old prejudice and emotional approach continues when he says that this is much more drastic than the soliciting of females <e> <s> the noble lord also mentioned the small number who are imprisoned <e> <s> however that does not alter the fact that in some courts people are sent to prison on very minor offences <e> <s> there is a deep built-in prejudice as regards this and unfortunately it permeates parliament and everywhere at the moment it is about time we broke out of it <e> <s> i think that i shall return to this matter at a later stage <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> very briefly i should like to support this amendment and to underline what the noble lord has said that it is not legalising cannabis and it is not doing away with the fine but it is giving the matter a better sense of proportion <e> <s> when the penalties were first put into the previous act many of us felt they were very draconian and did not make enough distinction between cannabis and other more serious drugs <e> <s> in people were given immediate custodial sentences by magistrates courts for the simple possession of cannabis and a further received suspended sentences of which probably some were activated at a later date <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i ask him if this is carefully worded to cover personal use whether one thinks people should smoke themselves to death drink themselves to death or do what they like in their own way <e> <s> that is one thing a point which was taken up by my noble friend but to say in argument that one cannot use a community service order or a suspended sentence returns this to the whole criminal orbit <e> <s> all this amendment is saying is that if people in their own homes want to indulge in something of which other people may disapprove very greatly then they should be allowed to do so <e> <s> it is quite ridiculous to talk of community service orders for people like them <e>", "<cs> may i also thank the noble lord lord elton for his patient and courteous manner and congratulate him on the numerous ways he found of saying no all the way through <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for repeating the statement which has been made in another place <e> <s> may i ask him why there was no parliamentary consultation before these as we see it reactionary proposals were put forward <e> <s> under the previous conservative government when the new water act was passed which set up the national water council and many of the bodies which the government are now undoing there was the fullest consultation <e> <s> when the last labour government discovered that the act was not working adequately a consultation document was circulated replies came in and a white paper announcing proposals was published <e> <s> but then came the general election <e> <s> these proposals seem to have been shrouded in an amazing amount of secrecy <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl the minister talked about savings and efficiency <e> <s> can he tell us how many jobs are going to be lost by the dissolution of the national water council <e> <s> there is an ominous reference to discussions with the trade unions but nothing about jobs lost <e> <s> if there are going to be savings and greater efficiency <e> <s> i think that this must mean that there are going to be jobs lost <e> <s> i should also like to know what is happening to the something like million investment in the water space amenity commission which is also going to go by the board at the same time <e> <s> i must support what the noble baroness lady seear said while obviously we do not blame the minister personally the answers have been extraordinarily unsatisfactory <e> <s> if this is to be left in this way there will obviously be very great disquiet from all sides of the house <e> <s> i think the noble earl should be aware that we cannot leave it like this and that it has certainly not been received very happily <e>", "<cs> my lords although happily we are going to ratify the convention tomorrow it will not come into effect until most european states have ratified it <e> <s> therefore will the government in the meantime undertake to take action as they are entitled to since it is the sulphur emissions horn the chimneys of the power stations in this country which are the principal cause of acid rain in south scandinavia <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank the minister for his very clear exposition of the derelict land bill which is before us today which enables us all to understand it without giving me the burden of having to go over it again or ask many questions which i might have had to ask if it had not been so clearly put before us both in the bill and in the ministers explanation <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister leaves that point if there were not only a deserving but an outstanding case would it be possible for that area to be designated for that purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord has made out as good a case as he possibly can on this amendment and has answered a number of questions <e> <s> he did not answer a question put by the noble lord lord wigoder and i think that the noble lord is absolutely right when he says that for us to go ahead in this way without having more information is quite wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords yes it does <e> <s> i thought that the noble baroness was making a general statement as a matter of fact <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord elystan-morgan has answered the ministers reply <e> <s> he is right when he says that no real answer has been given <e> <s> the noble lord still appears to have overlooked the difference which we both stressed between being on a licence of parole or being under supervision under a supervision order <e> <s> there is a strong element of unfairness to the young offender in the way the system is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord harris not only for his support but for his enabling me to recover from my surprise pushing the opening door had knocked me backwards <e> <s> i am also grateful to the minister <e> <s> i hope it will be realised that the maximum number of hours is not the same as the normal number and that the amendment will prove to be a constructive move towards keeping at least some people out of custodial care <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to oppose the amendments that the minister has must moved not because i think the motivation behind them is wrong or bad in fact i think they are based on good intentions but this is a case where good intentions even those of <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble lord for a moment would he as a lawyer not agree that there are many things on which there is plenty of evidence to show as his noble friend has already pointed out that it would be quite silly to have an experiment when all the evidence is against it <e> <s> he must agree that is so <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i might ask the minister to consider the case which came the other day before my court of a man who was an alcoholic <e> <s> i do not think it was realised that he was an alcoholic at the time he was given the suspended <e>", "<cs> yes it had to be my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment moved by my noble friend and to which i have my name <e> <s> most of the arguments in favour of the amendment have already been used and explained <e> <s> the main resistance to the amendment moved by my noble friend at committee stage and he referred to it was that it was cruel to give hope when that hope would not be realised <e> <s> but together with other noble lords who have spoken in favour of the amendment i believe that it is far more cruel to feel ignored isolated and forgotten <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not intend to speak because everything seems to have been said <e> <s> but i felt that i must do so in view of the contribution from the noble earl lord fortescue <e> <s> i am also a member of the magistrates association but disagree with them <e> <s> i was not aware that they came out officially against this <e> <s> i am not sure they have <e> <s> it may be just a view expressed by a number of the members of magistrates association <e>", "<cs> my lords on the other hand the justices clerks society is for it <e> <s> one of the points that the noble earl lord fortescue made was the unwillingness of the probation officers <e> <s> the conference of chief probation officers has repeatedly welcomed this proposal <e> <s> when the noble lord said that two months was not a deterrent i would take issue with him <e> <s> it is generally accepted at the moment that it is the first few weeks or days in prison which act as a deterrent before the person gets used to it and is institutionalised <e> <s> with great respect if one has not been in prison and most of us have not it is probably impossible to judge the effect of this <e> <s> i think that two months is a deterrent but this provision would also be helpful in emptying the prisons <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister is saying that in the guidelines to the courts this will be spelt out and it will be made clear to them that the initiative will lie with them then from my point of view i should find that satisfactory and my noble friend probably would as well <e> <s> but we wait to see the wording <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i did not want to interrupt the noble viscount in full flow but may i ask him if it is not true that permission goes with the land and that if the land is sold then as the permission goes with it it is not incumbent on the new buyer to carry out any of the building or plans that have been agreed before <e>", "<cs> i think the noble viscount is my lords but i will not pursue it now <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble viscount would give way for a moment because i referred to the developers <e> <s> what i was concerned about was not the distinguished assessors and that the developer was one of them but that the final choice was made by the developer <e> <s> that was the point <e>", "<cs> my lords may i briefly clarify that point <e> <s> when i was talking about going too fast i was talking about giving permission and building over the whole acres that it would have been better to have done it in smaller pieces <e>", "<cs> my lords first let me thank those noble lords who spoke in support of my prayer and also those noble lords who did not speak in support of it but were very interesting to listen to <e> <s> i thought that the minister certainly gave a very full and broad <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister give a little more information on the second part of that paragraph <e> <s> having been convicted of an offence is fairly straightforward and that would be on record <e> <s> but could the noble lord add something to what he has said or rather what he has not said about or for any other reasons <e> <s> does that not seem to be a very wide circle <e> <s> how is this going to be defined so that the local authorities and also the courts may know <e> <s> because this is subject to an appeal whereas unfortunately some of the other reasons for turning down are not <e>", "<cs> my lords may i press the minister a little further on the point about or for any other reason <e> <s> is the minister aware that although this matter was discussed in committee many of us were unhappy about it not because it dealt with sex shops but because of the rights of appeal and the rights of individual citizens <e> <s> can the noble lord not say that even if he cannot give an answer now this will be gone into further and that if guidelines are given to local authorities there will be some criteria or headings covering the or for any other reason <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to thank the minister for repeating the statement and for doing so with such clarity because the one thing that is lacking from the statement is clarity <e> <s> one could never accuse it of being a simple or simplistic statement <e> <s> the secretary of state has announced what he is going to do in and he is using a number of supplementary reports and to legalise his intentions some might call them threatening intentions which have been mooted <e> <s> i would first like to ask how can authorities plan expenditure with this spate of supplementary reports coming along at intervals when they need to know exactly where they are <e>", "<cs> my lords i think my first impression on listening to the minister explain the proposals before us tonight and he explained them with as great a clarity as he could command was how complicated these rules are <e> <s> i am sure that all of us in this house on all sides were listening very carefully and felt some sympathy for the minister having to explain something which even people who have taken an interest in this subject and perhaps know a little about it find extraordinarily complicated <e> <s> if this is so then how much more complicated is it going to be for immigrants themselves and for those people who are attempting to advise them <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i can correct the noble viscount <e> <s> i did not say the quality of life <e> <s> i referred to the quality of the people concerned <e> <s> i said that whatever the tories were concerned with they were frightened they were black i did not say the quality of life but i can quite understand how i used the word quality and one often thinks of the quality of life <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble lord my point was that it could be and i think i am right about this people whose leave has ended and who are appealing <e> <s> it is while their appeal is pending that this could happen and the child could be affected <e> <s> also while the noble lord is answering that i would like his comments on what i suggested that shall should be substituted for may on that particular point <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank the minister for explaining so clearly at least as clearly as he can with this particular bill what should in fact be two bills <e> <s> so he has now totalled three bills this afternoon up to now <e> <s> i do not know what else he has up his sleeve <e> <s> this bill as he said falls into two distinct parts one dealing with the museums and the other the new commission <e> <s> i shall leave the discussion on the museums to my noble friend lord strabolgi who will be speaking later in the debate <e> <s> one personal point i should like to make however is how delighted i am to see that the armouries museum is having its own board of trustees <e> <s> in the days when i was a minister at the department of the environment and visited the tower of london on many occasions i always felt that the armoury was so buried in the body of the tower of london that it did not really have its own identity and was not always recognised as one of the leading armouries museums in the world <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble viscount to tell him that i was talking about the committees attached to the commission <e> <s> i was not talking about the commission or the trustees but about people who probably had less onus on them <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl leaves that point because he is going through this list extremely well answering us all may i say that i do not expect an answer immediately but if he is talking about whether the commission may be short of money would he take back the thought that it is going to be essential for this agency to be able to employ a director at a pretty high salary when it leaves the umbrella of the civil service <e> <s> would he take this into account when he is discussing the administrative cost as for example when he answered the points put by the noble duke the duke of grafton <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister can assist us further on the remark he made about the mattresses <e> <s> i think i am right in understanding him to say that research is being carried out into something which is not so inflammable but is it not true that on the market at the moment there are a great many mattresses which one can buy which are not inflammable <e> <s> how long a period is this research going to take and would it not be better in the meantime to produce a mattress which is not made of polyurethane and put that to use <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that a great many people are unaware of the existence of these councils and that they are also unaware that they can approach them if anything goes wrong <e> <s> both councils provide a guarantee scheme and will repair such work at no cost to the householder <e> <s> that being so <e>", "<cs> my lords before we enter the committe stage of the bill may i first thank the minister for providing the guide to schedule which has been of great help to us and enabled many of us to put down amendments which unfortunately are rather late but would have been quite impossible without it <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down one point has struck me and my noble friend lord jenkins of putney <e> <s> are we to understand that whereas in the past his and him covered both sexes now we have had a revolution and that her now covers him and her <e>", "<cs> what i said was that they were not asking for security of tenure that is taken for granted because they argue that in the civil service the position is altering all the time <e> <s> people are not staying there for life or until they are <e> <s> what the staff are worried about is that they do not know where they are <e> <s> they want to feel on very much firmer career ground than they feel at the moment <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> i did not think that the government would accept the amendments as they stand <e> <s> however it has been <e>", "<cs> i would ask the noble earl the minister to reconsider this although i do not expect an answer from him now <e> <s> as my noble friend has pointed out <e> <s> this is something which appears in other acts and it seems rather unnecessary to have any sort of fight <e> <s> even though the government might feel it to be repetitious if we ever get a bill which is not repetitious it will deserve a very big medal indeed <e> <s> i do not consider that the examples which the noble earl gave answered my point <e> <s> he talked about the health and safety at work act <e> <s> but that is an entirely different type of legislation <e> <s> the nearest example is that which i gave of the british library act which contains a similar provision <e> <s> it seems to me natural that the people concerned would turn to the british library act rather than to the health and safety at work act and that they would want to see the same assurances about consultation procedure incorporated in this bill <e> <s> i will again remind the noble earl the minister that it refers not only to the v and a but also to the science museum and all the other museums which fall within this part of the bill <e>", "<cs> i should have retained the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale <e> <s> i find this very complicated and the exchanges that have taken place have made it even more so <e> <s> i must confess i am really not clear about it at all and am even more confused now <e> <s> i should like to read what the minister has said and also what the noble and learned lord lord simon said <e> <s> if he is at all unhappy about it i wish he would say something now to help to elucidate it for us before i withdraw the amendment <e> <s> he put very pertinent questions to the minister and he has probably been able to understand the ministers answer far better than i have <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the ministers reply and for his offer to write to me <e> <s> i am still not satisfied by what he said <e> <s> we are still left with the words industrial tribunal which are still dependent upon the individual no longer being employed <e> <s> it seems to me that if one could have some form of arbitration machinery which does not depend on this it must be an improvement <e> <s> the fact that the individual can be represented at the industrial tribunal does not alter the fact that he cannot go before the industrial tribunal until he is out of work <e> <s> it seems rather a wasteful way of doing it <e> <s> again it is a complicated matter <e> <s> i would not have thought it would necessarily have to be the type of arbitration machinery that exists in some places now <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend and also to the noble baroness lady seear who also put her finger right on the point of this <e> <s> i shall be grateful now that the noble earl has had the advantage of their contributions if when he writes he will perhaps copy his reply to both my noble friend and the noble baroness so that we are all clear about the present position <e> <s> perhaps he will also bear in mind i stress this that what i understand is being done away with is a form of arbitration machinery and that this other very much more guillotine type of draconic machinery is being used instead <e> <s> i beg to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> we have to come along with the times and accept that there are a great many people who could make a real contribution in these jobs and they are jobs they are not pastimes nowadays but who are prevented because they cannot afford to undertake this just with expenses <e> <s> my noble friend said that in this house there are some who get expenses and others who are paid <e> <s> there are some of us who probably are deserving of a bit more pay than we get just the expenses <e> <s> certainly those on the front bench are in the same position for getting expenses whether you are here all day and night or here for half an hour <e> <s> therefore i do not think that that analogy works very well <e>", "<cs> we support very strongly the amendment moved by the noble lord lord montagu <e> <s> i think there is little to add to what has already been said <e> <s> the point made by the noble viscount is very important namely that if you have it in the statute the chances are i have not got as much faith as he has in the treasury although i do not know how much faith he still has in getting money from the treasury that at least you have a weapon in your hand you have something in the statute book it is there <e> <s> there may be an assurance given to us in this committee chamber that it will be all right and that may appear in <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank the minister for his statement and say it is a great pity that the material of the statements he has to make do not equal the tone in which he gives them <e> <s> the tone is very good the material is awful and unfortunate <e> <s> when the present secretary of state took office the rate support grant was per cent in other words there was a per cent <e> <s> grant from central government to local government <e> <s> it will now be per cent <e> <s> as set out in this statement but it could be even less than per cent <e> <s> after the penalties for overspending which have been spelled out to us <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister leaves that point <e> <s> i should like to say that on the whole the tory-controlled councils are in far less deprived areas need to make far less expenditure and can tolerate cuts far better than the great majority of labour councils <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord the deputy chairman what happened to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> was it not moved <e>", "<cs> i speak only to support the noble lords amendment because it will as he said bring consistency into the bill with the other museums <e>", "<cs> i see a great deal of merit in and have considerable sympathy for what my noble friend lord jenkins of putney has said <e> <s> indeed i had the same feeling when we dealt with the national heritage memorial fund although we did not seem to get very far and in the end because in that case two ministers were involved we all felt that we would only go forward if there were a prime ministerial appointment <e> <s> i also feel that there are a great many advantages in having a secretary of state involved especially if he is interested in the particular subject museum or gallery <e>", "<cs> before any decision is taken and in answer to what the noble viscount lord eccles said the fact remains that though part of the collection is still in the tower of london and later on we have an amendment to keep the greater part of the collection in the tower nevertheless under the bill the armouries have been devolved as a museum on their own <e> <s> therefore as they are a museum the fact that they are located in the tower of london and have a connection with it i would suggest with respect is irrelevant to the point that we are now discussing as to who should make the appointment <e> <s> i believe that the method should be consistent with the way in which appointments are made to the other devolved museums <e>", "<cs> may i move amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> this is again a question of inconsistency so far as the armouries museum is concerned <e> <s> these amendments are concerned with bringing its funding into line with the funding of the other museums <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> and are paving amendments to no <e> <s> <e> <s> there does not seem to be any good reason why all the museums cited in this bill should not be given the same financial provisions <e> <s> those national museums which at present enjoy trustee status are funded directly by money provided by parliament <e> <s> this method of funding has always worked well with these museums <e>", "<cs> there does not seem to be any expression of opinion about this matter <e> <s> in these circumstances and i take it that the noble lord lord montagu takes the same view otherwise he would have spoken we ought to withdraw the amendment at this stage read carefully what the minister has said because i should like to read it as well as having listened intently to it and then see how we feel about it and if necessary come back on report <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment to which i have put my name <e> <s> it was probably considered implicit in the bill that what is proposed would happen but i suggest it is necessary to include a provision of this type because as we have said on many occasions when debating the bill we are talking not just about now or the near future but the very <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for those remarks <e> <s> there is one matter on which i should like to feel clear perhaps i have misunderstood the position <e> <s> he referred to the trustees having to ccupy a part of the tower <e> <s> the amendment simply says that the major part of the collection should be within the tower of london <e> <s> does the noble earl mean that the words within the armouries should be added <e> <s> in that case i would understand what he was saying but surely one need not say that the trustees must occupy say a part of the victoria and albert or part of the science museum <e> <s> i am probably being rather obtuse but i am not clear on the point <e>", "<cs> i would like to thank the noble earl for that very full reply which will be of great interest to me when i read it again and also to the civil servants involved <e> <s> i am delighted to hear that consultations are continuing and hope that something will be sorted out <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord craigton for the opening he has given me for my amendment <e> <s> the reason i did not entirely like his amendment was because it seemed to give a different nuance to the word conservancy and also we have the nature conservancy council <e> <s> i very much take his point about the clumsiness of the nomenclature at the moment but it seemed to me that it did explain the nature of the commission for ancient monuments and historic buildings for england that it is in fact the merging together of these two bodies <e> <s> i felt that ought to be extant for the time being what happens in the future i do not know <e>", "<cs> perhaps someone could give some assistance in the drafting here so that we may find an alternative to the words also known as <e> <s> i consider that we should not at this stage wipe out the commission for ancient monuments and historic buildings for england because it is in the bill and is what the bill is all about <e> <s> incidentally in choosing the hce i was trying to find something that did not conflict with the national memorial trust which is very important as well <e> <s> i am sure other noble lords or perhaps the noble earl can come forward with other ideas which may solve this point <e>", "<cs> before we withdraw our amendments may i ask the minister this question <e> <s> this does not solve the problem of finding a different title <e> <s> could clause be along the lines there shall be a body comprising the ancient monuments board and the historic buildings council for england known as then either the heritage commission for england or something different <e> <s> i think we should all think about this and perhaps the noble earl would get the brains of his department to look at it again <e>", "<cs> this is an amendment to which due to an error on my part it is not the fault of the public bill office my name was not added as i intended it to be <e> <s> this is one of the amendments which is the nub of the whole bill <e> <s> there are others which are coming later on charitable trusts and on the whole question of the capital amount which will be put into the commission in order to get them started <e> <s> as i think emerged from <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord who moved the amendment replies i want to put something straight <e> <s> the minister explained that the secretary of state has no intention of putting a stranglehold on this <e> <s> let me make it clear that that is not what i meant <e> <s> i believe entirely in the good faith of the secretary of state on this bill <e> <s> on many other aspects of policy like rate support grant and housing i disagree with him very strongly <e> <s> however what he has done regarding the heritage is admirable and i am sure that he wants this agency to work properly <e> <s> unless however he can come to some arrangement with the treasury about it and unless that door can be pushed back very hard with all the goodwill in the world it is just not going to work <e> <s> that will be the stranglehold upon it not the one which the minister wants to put upon it <e>", "<cs> in view of what the noble earl has said i am quite satisfied <e> <s> we will see what the government come forward with at the report stage <e> <s> meanwhile <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl very much for his sympathetic explanation with regard to the governments thinking on this matter <e> <s> i will take the other side of the coin now in pressing for consideration of including the word history <e> <s> one thing that has bothered me slightly about this shopping list and i entirely agree with the noble earl is that if we go on and on putting everything in there is a danger that we might get a commission of a great many people with very narrow fields of expertise and that anybody who is a generalist with a creative type of mind with something to add who does not fit into a particular slot will not be able to be on the commission <e> <s> i think the door must be left open <e>", "<cs> i take it that the minister is now going to take all this back and look at it again that nothing that has been suggested this evening will be ruled out <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> plea bargaining has paid off <e> <s> in supporting the noble viscount and lord sandford in this amendment <e> <s> i would add that it is extremely important when we are all the time asking local government to fork out both resources and personnel in intention and activity in a whole variety of aspects right across the field of the heritage whether archaeology buildings town planning conservation areas or whatever it is that if local government is asked to participate it must not only feel involved but be involved at the highest level <e> <s> it would be a grave mistake to leave it out <e> <s> the minister may say that there is no doubt that local government would be included and that someone would be on the commission who perhaps had some of the other talents that were needed as well as local government experience a local government posting at the time or a position on local government <e> <s> but i do not think that that would be good enough for the statute <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that the amendment achieves what the noble earl wants it to achieve which is that we should have differing periods so that everyone is not in together and out together <e> <s> if it shall be for not less than four or more than six years there is nothing to stop appointments being made for five years <e> <s> the noble lord needs to add something more to it to make it clear that there should be differing periods of time so that as he rightly says it would not be all in and all out at the same time <e>", "<cs> in order to clarify matters and to get this out of the way the only amendment that i have moved although i did speak to the others to save time which obviously was a mistake is amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> we have had a very long and i hope fruitful debate on this subject <e> <s> there is a great deal for us all to read and particularly as regards what the minister has said <e> <s> we are concerned when we come <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> if he can direct me to the point in the bill where this is covered <e> <s> i shall probably quite happily withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> is the minister giving an undertaking that this opportunity for secondment will be open to the commission <e> <s> we are dealing with an entirely new animal so one naturally wants to see that things that are not in the bill will be written in <e>", "<cs> due to the speed of the runner i think that that answer is satisfactory <e> <s> certainly for the time being <e> <s> i am happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i very strongly support the amendment <e> <s> if this amendment had not been put down by the noble lord and his friends i do not mean to co-opt myself on to the board of the british academy i should have put one down myself <e> <s> this is an extremely important matter <e> <s> the people concerned particularly those on the ancient monuments board are worried that they will be swallowed up by the commission and will disappear <e> <s> for high quality people to be involved over and above the small number who will be on the commission it is absolutely essential that there should be mandatory committees on which there will be scholars who at the moment are involved with the ancient monuments board and with other bodies connected with archaeology scholarship architecture and everything else <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister very much and i shall be happy if this can be taken into as it were the global review that he is to make of honoraria and when we come to it i shall not move amendment no <e> <s> h <e> <s> i therefore withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we are not really talking about whether the accounts are approved by the commission or the secretary of state it is that the commission as i understand it should appoint its own auditors <e> <s> i cannot see why the commission should not appoint its own auditors <e> <s> it should be given that independence <e> <s> whether the accounts are then seen by the secretary of state is another point <e>", "<cs> with that in mind in moving amendment no <e> <s> l i did in fact speak to amendment no <e> <s> m they are very much intertwined as the minister probably noticed <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> l is concerned with investigation and recording where conservation is for any reason impossible <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> m deals with archaeological areas and sites <e> <s> but in view of what the minister has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> i particularly like the words for both children and adults and interpretation <e> <s> the phrase covers the point succinctly and i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> yes i am sorry <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to disagree with the noble lord but is he not referring to amendment no <e> <s> which has not yet been reached <e>", "<cs> yes in relation to management and presentation <e> <s> i apologise to the noble lord and i support the line he has proposed <e>", "<cs> i wish to support the amendment <e>", "<cs> in view of that helpful reply from the minister i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord rennet referred to the efforts that i made to try to get clarification i feel i ought to say a word <e> <s> it is perfectly true that on second reading i asked for a reeling schedule as that appeared to be the best way to deal with a problem like this <e> <s> unfortunately the problem that has arisen is far greater than could be dealt with even by a reeling schedule as i think has become apparent as the bill has progressed <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble earl would comment on a point about which i feel very strongly namely the consolidation of all this legislation <e> <s> this is a most important and vital point <e>", "<cs> there is a great deal in what has been said by the noble lord lord kennet <e> <s> he has done a service to the committee by initiating this very important discussion <e> <s> however in view of what the noble earl has said i feel that he has gone as far as he can at this stage <e> <s> i did not expect the noble earl to say i will bring forward legislation to consolidate all heritage legislation at this point <e> <s> yet if he had left it that it was purely the business of the law commission i would have been very doubtful and unhappy and i would have supported the noble lord lord kennet if he were pressing his amendment to a division <e> <s> but as the noble earl has undertaken also to speak to his right honourable friend and as he is aware of the expressions of opinion from all parts of the committee that the committee feels very seriously and strongly about this matter i feel that we ought to give the noble earl that opportunity <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> this appears to be another example of where the committee is happily knitting up the bill for the government but we are happy to do that as long as <e>", "<cs> i did not like that answer one little bit i did not find it at all co-operative but i am certainly not going to press the amendment now <e> <s> i shall read what the minister has said very carefully and then come back to the crux of the problem either in the same way or perhaps by a different route <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i would very much like to support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord montagu of beaulieu <e> <s> it is extremely sensible and follows through the flavour of what we are trying to do for the commission on the financial side <e> <s> as regards the ministers amendment paragraphs <e>", "<cs> i have put my name to some of the amendments tabled by the noble lord lord dacre and his colleagues in the british academy <e> <s> however i am not very happy about this particular amendment because like the noble lord lord montagu i think it introduces a third tier which we do not need <e> <s> i think it makes even more important an amendment which was moved the other night by the noble lord lord dacre and to which i also put my name which was withdrawn after the minister had explained why they did not like it <e> <s> it was to the effect that the setting up of committees should not be a permissive function of the commission but should be mandatory <e>", "<cs> having listened to the remarks of the noble lord lord sandford on this interesting amendment i think we could go along with it so long as when the government are looking at the matter again they take into account the points that have been raised on this topic on other detailed amendments both those previously discussed and those yet to be debated by the committee <e> <s> i also support the point made by the noble lord lord kennet and i was struck in exactly the same way by the wording <e> <s> as the functions of the commission are primarily those of conservation and preservation i agree that those words should appear in the clause dealing with functions it could be lopsided and ill-balanced to leave the emphasis entirely in the provision dealing with presentation and interpretation <e>", "<cs> my name is joined with that of the noble baroness lady airey of abingdon in the amendment and the other amendments to which she has referred <e> <s> i wonder whether i might add to those amendments amendment no <e> <s> ea which is on exactly the same point though it is spelt out rather more <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> ea is starred because i fear that it was put down only yesterday <e> <s> i have just discovered that it is not on the grouping list and perhaps i may give the minister a moment to find it <e> <s> subsection of the amendment on page of the marshalled list deals with exactly the same point about which the noble baroness has just been speaking namely that of the house which is special or outstanding for a reason that is not to do with the architecture <e> <s> there are several other aspects of the matter <e>", "<cs> speaking for myself i thank the minister for his reply and also for saying that he will read and look into the matter again <e> <s> i will point out two things <e> <s> one is that it is made clear in amendment no <e> <s> ea that exceptional circumstances make it appropriate in a particular case so i do not think there are going to be a great many of those <e> <s> secondly if finally they cannot see that this is the right way to deal with it then if we can find a way so that the houses that i cited which are in rural areas and may be single houses or houses that missed the net of either a conservation area or a town scheme would be eligible for grant because that was part of the purpose of these amendments they could pick them up in that way <e> <s> otherwise as far as i personally am concerned i await to hear what the noble earl has to say and come back on the next stage or see whether perhaps if we all met together between now and the next stage we might be able to find some way of solving what has now turned out to be several problems rolled up into what look like identical amendments but they are not so <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether i can be of any help <e> <s> the basis was the same that the commission should undertake research <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> v which i moved was simply saying that the commission may undertake or sponsor research in furtherance of its functions <e> <s> i do not know that there is all that much difference between that amendment and amendment no <e> <s> e except that the tail-end is spelt out rather more elegantly <e> <s> it finishes up by saying <e>", "<cs> i have to thank the minister very much for accepting the principle <e> <s> of course i will leave it to him to find a better form of words and therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think that in the circumstances i had better leave it that way and perhaps come back to this on report <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lady white for intervening <e> <s> i was about to get up and point that out to the minister <e> <s> i still think that the principle should operate so far as subsection is concerned <e> <s> my noble friend is absolutely right <e> <s> subsection states that <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in view of what the minister has said and as he is going to look at this again together with the other acquisitions i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> with that assurance and subject to how it works out and looks in print we will consider the matter again <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i feel that i ought to be sure that there will be lively and positive encouragement for things to be done which have not always been done in the past <e> <s> one way of trying to set about that was to put it in the bill <e> <s> the minister has said that the powers are there for there to be guidelines which the commission could send out to other bodies in order to try to encourage very much more these types of partnership conservation <e> <s> although the powers may be there if they are going to be the same powers as the hbc has this work may not take place <e> <s> to get it under way is the problem <e> <s> it is not only a question of money but of having the staff and being able to find a way round it in order to set these things on the road <e> <s> if nothing goes into the bill about this it will cause me concern <e>", "<cs> yes certainly <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl for his reply and on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i add my support to this amendment <e> <s> in view of what has been said by the minister and the noble lords who have just spoken it seems to me that it would be a very happy compromise all round if may is substituted for shall <e> <s> certainly the most important place would be in the second line of the amendment <e> <s> there is another shall further down which could also be changed to may <e>", "<cs> it is no good the noble earl saying oh <e> <s> i am afraid it is true <e> <s> it is one of those unpleasant truths that have to be told occasionally and the moment has come now when we are talking of the transference of functions from the department to the commission <e> <s> one can keep all this very much in house when one is working in a department and battering away on ones own or with help but now we are making this change the time has come to shake up the psa a bit <e> <s> it needs it <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> i mentioned the post office at chichester merely as an example of what i consider to be architectural insensitivity <e> <s> i did not consider that the putting up of modern buildings necessarily had anything to do with this bill although in that case it was put up in a conservation area <e> <s> therefore it is in fact still relevant to the bill <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lord lord kennet in his amendment <e> <s> whether or not the amendment is slightly defective from the governments point of view the principle it enshrines is important <e> <s> the noble lord initiated a debate on beverley and i remember trying with him to see whether we could do something about it <e> <s> it was thought that it was quite impossible <e> <s> unless one does lay down something like this it is difficult <e>", "<cs> i certainly do not intend to press the amendment though i do not think that the position is quite satisfactory <e> <s> perhaps the amendment is rather too sweeping but i should like to find a way in which the commission would have a proper sight of planning applications that relate to listed buildings <e> <s> perhaps the minister will have consultations and consider coming back with a proposal that does not take in quite so large an area but deals with the kernel of the point <e> <s> i think that that might be satisfactory <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am delighted that the commission is to be trusted and that it may authorise its own inspectors to look at other peoples monuments in england but does the secretary of state really need to retain the power to authorise inspectors to look at them too <e> <s> can he not leave that to the commission <e> <s> who is going to advise the secretary of state on those buildings <e> <s> surely it will be the commission <e> <s> this will result in duplication of staff which is quite unnecessary <e> <s> this seems to be another odd thing which has crept into the bill whereby the secretary of state retains unnecessary concurrent powers because the commission could take over <e>", "<cs> again we find ourselves in the same position <e> <s> am i right in saying that the secretary of state is to retain concurrent powers to acquire and take into guardianship monuments and land in their vicinity in england <e> <s> there are no notes on clauses to help on this particular point and section of the act which is being amended i cannot find in this guide to schedule should have thought that it would be enough for the commission and the local authority to have concurrent powers as to guardianship <e> <s> would not the minister agree with that <e>", "<cs> i will just have to let this amendment go for the time being but quite frankly these matters are of considerable complexity particularly as they are situated where they are in schedule and if the noble earl will let me have the notes on clauses and an up-to-date refresher on the guide to schedule i can look at these and consider what to do before report stage <e>", "<cs> so far as i can make out although this is very difficult territory which i find very hard going at the moment the amendment seems to stop the commission from making regulations <e> <s> it also forces the secretary of state to consult the commission before he makes the regulations <e> <s> incidentally as the noble earl must know local authorities can make regulations without consulting anybody <e> <s> are we now in an area of piffling detail <e> <s> why does the secretary of state not give the power for making regulations to the commission in respect of monuments in england and again save duplication of staff <e> <s> is it really so fundamental that this respectable high-grade new body should not be given powers of direction <e> <s> again we seem to be doubling up <e> <s> these matters all seem to run together but we are dealing with them on a piecemeal basis <e> <s> talk about a belt-and-braces job this is the whole lot with safety pins <e>", "<cs> while we are in a confessional mood i now realise that when speaking to amendment no <e> <s> when i was quite happy i was in fact talking about amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i will not say it all again but this was the amendment which stopped the commission from making regulations and forcing the secretary of state to consult the commission before making them <e> <s> this is a whole series of amendments which are very confusing and this again makes the point about the amount of confusion there is over these amendments <e> <s> anyway i apologise <e>", "<cs> the minister has already spoken to it and i have already objected to it two amendments back so i will leave it there <e>", "<cs> this is again fairly complicated and it is difficult to take it all in from just hearing it <e> <s> i shall have to leave it there for the moment and read what the minister has said <e> <s> i will also see how the amendment looks when he produces the new amendment <e> <s> i gathered that he agrees that there is some sorting out to be done that there are two specific problems and they have been joined together at the moment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i welcome this amendment in general terms <e> <s> i am sorry if this sounds churlish but in subsection the commission is again being hedged down <e> <s> the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment <e> <s> i think it may well be that it was considered that land encompassed land and buildings in the schedule <e> <s> i do not know <e> <s> nevertheless i think it should be made absolutely clear <e> <s> it is true as the noble lord lord beloff said that archaeology is carried out in buildings within the remnants of buildings or under buildings <e>", "<cs> earlier this afternoon the noble lord lord kennet was leading up to the deletion of schedule <e> <s> i then said that we would wait to hear what the minister said when he came back on the question of consolidation <e> <s> we have obviously moved away from the idea of a guide and a keeling schedule <e> <s> it is now quite clear that consolidation is the only way in which this matter will be sorted out <e> <s> since early this afternoon we have unfortunately had example after example of the complexity of the bill and the difficulties with which even those of us who have tried to accustom ourselves to it have found in dealing with it <e> <s> i thought that the recent amendment moved by the noble lord lord beloff epitomised exactly what was happening under the bill <e> <s> we were told that that refers back to something else and that that refers to buildings and land <e> <s> in the end the minister rightly sensibly and co-operatively as he has been throughout the bill decided to accept the amendment because it made sense and those people who read it could see what it meant without going back and back and back <e>", "<cs> it may be that when the noble earl has read what i have said he will write to me in answer to some of the points that he has not covered <e> <s> however i shall not delay the committee any longer <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that not only full but hopeful reply <e> <s> as i understand it he said that the unspent balances will be able to be kept <e> <s> he also went into the next amendment which i have not yet moved on the question of profit arising <e> <s> all i would ask on that is about the words substantially greater <e> <s> i think the noble earl said that if the profits are <e>", "<cs> i would prefer to deal with that when we come to it after e <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i can pursue the matter any further at this stage and so i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the capital fund is needed here not for buying buildings but in order to invest to increase the revenue it will need to be spending to a far greater extent than the department is spending or that the two boards separately have been spending <e> <s> this is tied up with a previous amendment on which the minister as he rightly said was not very helpful <e> <s> that dealt with the power of the commission to be able to invest <e> <s> the capital sum is not meant for them to buy up property but to set themselves up and carry out all the duties they are supposed to carry out and to do so in this very much more creative and inspiring innovative way <e> <s> i think that it is getting rather late to pursue this <e> <s> i wanted to make the point of the amendment and then to seek to return to it later <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that explanation <e> <s> i take it that this means that if on a future occasion the royal palaces come under the commissions mangement that would need legislation <e> <s> is that so <e>", "<cs> as i understand what the noble earl was saying the government have no intention at the moment of putting in any enabling clause <e> <s> i raised this matter by means of an enabling clause to see whether they were going to do that <e> <s> may i say i am delighted to hear that the royal parks are going to be kept outside this bill <e> <s> that is absolutely right because they are different from buildings and ancient monuments <e> <s> if what are known as the money spinners like the tower of london and hampton court are to be kept by the department away from the commission then two matters arise <e> <s> one is the lack of incentive to make money and inspire more enterprise in the running of these places <e> <s> how are the commission going to show this entrepreneurial vigour on which the secretary of state puts such emphasis <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we are <e>", "<cs> when are we going to have the benefit of the governments thinking <e> <s> the noble earl made a very elegant speech and thanked us all very nicely but he said nothing at all about the future of the royal commission <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble earl will call a division on it <e> <s> in the absence of anything further for the time being i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not think i spoke to them together <e> <s> so far as i remember i did not speak to a <e>", "<cs> i certainly did not speak to the point with which i am now dealing <e> <s> i was concerned with the form of the charity trust or charity fund which would be part of the commission for ancient monuments and historic buildings <e> <s> what i am now discussing applies to a different part of the bill and this amendment is designed to have the commission for ancient monuments and historic buildings in england added to the list of museums so that it will not be subject to registration under the act nor to the supervisory powers of the charity commission <e> <s> that is all i am seeking to do and i beg to move <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords while accepting the governments view on privatisation would not the minister agree that even if there is a saving on the rates this should not be at the expense of efficiency in collecting the refuse <e> <s> if people are being almost forced to pay in order to get their rubbish collected this is not an efficient way of running a refuse collection service <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that much of this land remains vacant or under-used because of the cutbacks in the rate support grant and the capital control restrictions which were introduced by the local government act <e> <s> is it not also true that the government are perhaps unintentionally but nevertheless actually adding land to these registers every week as firms close down largely due to government policy <e>", "<cs> my lords we thank the minister for repeating that statement <e> <s> all in this house are aware that this is a very serious matter already millions of people are having to boil water <e> <s> the situation could rapidly worsen within two or three weeks by which time the sewerage system would become unusable with sewage flowing into the rivers <e> <s> under the law the government have a statutory obligation to provide all <e>", "<cs> my lords i will speak very briefly in support of the amendment moved by the noble viscount lord eccles and supported by my noble friend lord strabolgi although in his own amendment he makes a proviso <e> <s> it seems to me that the objections to this amendment fall into several parts <e> <s> one is that one should leave well alone <e> <s> another is that the whole staff and the heads of most of the museums are against this amendment <e> <s> another is that it just could not be worked out anyhow because people would gang up or because it would be impossible to choose the keepers to serve on the board <e> <s> all those are valid arguments only if one is first making it mandatory which the noble viscount is not doing and secondly if it is supposed to take effect immediately <e> <s> but as the noble viscount has pointed out and i strongly agree with him we are not going to secure legislation along these lines in respect of museums either in the near distant or even in the far distant future <e>", "<cs> my lords before he sits down may i ask the minister a question on this amendment as i moved a similar one at committee stage <e> <s> i am not sure that this is altogether clear <e> <s> he wrote to us in those terms and has spelled it out again now <e> <s> but he is very well aware that what is in <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his very clear and concise explanation of this issue <e> <s> with great respect it is all very well for him to say that this does not mean that they are any lesser bodies it does not mean this and that <e> <s> the point is that this is the way the people concerned feel <e> <s> speaking personally one can argue that it may not necessarily make all that difference whether it is the secretary of state <e> <s> this could apply to all the museums or just to the armouries <e> <s> it is unfortunate <e> <s> it is a very narrow view that the government are taking over this matter because it really is nonsense <e> <s> i have discussed this with a wide range of people who have a great deal of experience and a diversity of views on the whole question of the museums <e> <s> to say that its tie-up with the department of the environment means that the chairman of the trustees cannot be appointed or should not be appointed by the prime minister is quite frankly nonsense <e> <s> however as we have voted already so far as the trustees are concerned and as i imagine so many people who are not in the chamber at the moment would come in and vote against the amendment as they did before i shall not take up the time of the house <e> <s> i hope that in another place they will think that it makes more sense and shows more humanity and sensitivity if they take the line which the noble lord and i have put forward <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i welcome this amendment which covers broadly the ground that the noble lord and myself were anxious to get established <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords it is interesting to hear the contributions from the house <e> <s> i am grateful for the support from the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale and the noble lord lord sandford who i think hit the nail on the head in many of the points he made <e> <s> i am not sure whether the noble lord lord mancroft was or was not supporting me <e> <s> if as he says one gets used to a word it seems to me that it is very much easier and simpler to get used to saying heritage commission rather than saying commission for ancient monuments and historic buildings <e> <s> it is not a question of a strange word but of a string of words <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the house may i say that i omitted to ask the noble lord lord charteris before he sat down whether he felt the same objection applied to heritage conservation commission as he felt applied to heritage commission <e> <s> i am sorry i overlooked that point <e>", "<cs> he has not spoken my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming the charitable aspects of the statement which the minister has outlined which put the commission in line with the national heritage memorial fund i ought perhaps to point out that some other aspects have not been covered <e> <s> these will cause considerable anxiety and will create hardship for the commission <e> <s> i have not seen in print the ministers statement but i believe he said that so far as taxation otherwise is concerned the commission will be treated just like anybody else will be treated and that vat and other aspects of taxation except for the charitable dispositions will not be affected <e> <s> i shall not go into vat on this occasion <e> <s> nevertheless for many years many of us have felt very strongly about the imposition of vat on the repair and restoration of historic buildings and monuments because it makes it so costly and often impossible to conserve buildings before it is too late <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome this amendment very much indeed <e> <s> i cannot remember whether i moved the amendment but certainly i spoke strongly in favour of having a larger number of commissioners particularly when they get to the point of setting up committees <e> <s> i am pleased that the government have taken this view <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i should like to support these amendments and welcome them very much as i think they are a great improvement particularly in including history and taking out history of architecture because we have left architecture in <e> <s> i also welcome town and country planning <e> <s> i think this makes a more comprehensive and balanced list <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment although i am well aware of the reasons that the minister gave for opposing it previously and although i believe he does not oppose it on the basis of being anti-local government <e> <s> the way that the amendment is worded also having knowledge of local government could well mean that one of the commissioners could be doubling with experience of local government and some other expertise <e> <s> it is important that the relationships between what is now the department of the environment which is now handling all this work and local government should be carried on into the commission <e> <s> it is essential particularly when the commission becomes a quango on its own that there should be at least one commissioner with knowledge of local government <e> <s> frankly i imagine it will end up with a number of people having such knowledge in exactly the same way as have members of the historic buildings council for england <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble lord <e> <s> lord strathcona in his amendment <e> <s> as he rightly said this matter was debated in committee although the amendment was in a slightly different form <e> <s> i do not think that we are satisfied with the commission being left to carry out this task on its own <e> <s> as the noble lord pointed out if by any chance the commission has to be wound up it will go back to the government anyhow <e> <s> therefore it seems rather unnecesary to have started out on the other route <e> <s> it is also very difficult to see how it will be prevented from encroaching on grant-in-aid unless we have the firmest possible assurance that the pension content in grant-in-aid payments will he per cent <e> <s> once the government get that far i should have thought that it would be far better to leave the matter in the hands of the government as it is now <e> <s> so far as i can discover in recent years one quango which has had the same sort of problems was the countryside commission and the government have taken full responsibility for the pension scheme <e> <s> with everything else being added to a very new body and as i said before we are knitting the fabric of its existence as we go along why add a pension scheme when throughout their life the government have had experience of handling such schemes and could continue to handle this without the commission losing any independence <e>", "<cs> my lords maybe i did not explain it very well or i have created some confusion about this <e> <s> there was no intention that these committees should replace or in any way take the place of either in work or in importance the main commission <e> <s> i was moving that the commission which no doubt at least i hope it will otherwise it will not be able to keep up with the work will be setting up a number of committees should set up initially two committees to cover the work of the ancient monuments board and the historic buildings council <e> <s> the work they would be doing would obviously come to them via the commission itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that explanation <e> <s> as i said it was in the nature of a probing amendment and i will read his reply in <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house <e> <s> i may say that i wanted to avoid this <e> <s> i thought i had gone into that in great detail when discussing the name <e> <s> it is very difficult from the lexical point of view <e> <s> there is not very much difference but the words have altered over the centuries <e> <s> the word preserve on the whole has come to be used for archaeological remains and to keep things as they are <e> <s> it also implies to me and to many people that i discussed this with a sort of first-aid immediate action to be taken whereas conserve has a wider context <e> <s> it involves and this i think is important using the same building but restoring it and using it for another purpose <e> <s> i do not think that preserve would cover that <e> <s> preserve <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak again only with the leave of the house and i do not know how proper all this is i think that probably the minister is being very good natured about this <e> <s> i think we all want to try to get it as right as we can <e> <s> as i understand it historic buildings encompass the whole field from the largest stately home down to an historic cottage <e> <s> they are historic buildings <e> <s> many of them as we know however small or wherever they are are listed <e> <s> so it covers all <e> <s> i should like to refer the noble baroness to the governments amendment which refers to historic buildings <e> <s> the advantage and i would have thought that she would agree of my amendment is that it includes archaeological and conservation areas <e> <s> therefore it takes in a wider sweep of historic buildings because of the conservation areas <e>", "<cs> my lords this is very difficult <e> <s> the noble earl lord perth said that he agreed with part of my amendment but not with the other part <e> <s> the noble lord lord beaumont is clearly much in favour and so is the noble lord lord kennet <e> <s> i will take it that the minister is certainly going to look seriously at the question of preservation and conservation <e> <s> if at the end of the day it is felt that they are almost interchangeable then there is no harm and a great deal of good to be done by putting in both words <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not gain the impression that the house did feel that <e> <s> there was quite a body of opinion which accepted that there was a difference between these two words <e> <s> my own understanding was that the noble earl stated in his reply to amendment no <e> <s> a that this matter was something the government would look at including the words preservation and conservation because there was a difference between them <e> <s> that has not been completely denied <e>", "<cs> i did not say that my lords <e> <s> i was only using those words to illustrate that there was some inconsistency in the bill <e> <s> that did not alter my major argument that i considered that the words each had a particular place in the language of the two bodies concerned and that there were different nuances attached to the words <e> <s> if the noble earl the minister will say that he will look at this matter again not with a view at the present moment of cutting out one word then we can get on <e>", "<cs> i have moved the amendment my lords <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords i do not know quite what is happening <e> <s> all i am asking is that the noble earl the minister will look at the matter and at the inclusion of both words in the bill <e> <s> my noble friend lady white has pointed out as i did during the rather long debate we had on the title for the commission that there are two different meanings and the words are very often used in a different way <e> <s> archaeologists more often use the word preserve whereas conservationists and the historic buildings people tend to use conserve and so i cannot see anything wrong about having both words in the bill to cover every eventuality <e> <s> i was moving my amendment but was trying to avoid all this and i only wanted the acknowledgement of the noble earl the minister that i was right in my understanding that he was looking into this matter and was considering it at the moment certainly very favourably <e>", "<cs> but my lords <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with what has been said by the noble lord lord beaumont the noble lord lord kennet and the co-signatory of the amendment the noble lord lord montagu <e> <s> i find the position quite extraordinary <e> <s> it seems to me thinking back to our earlier debates that the governments line has hardened <e> <s> this is pinpointing the whole dichotomy of the government over the heritage commission <e> <s> the evidence is there <e> <s> it is not the noble earls fault <e> <s> it is just the way in which the government are now running <e>", "<cs> my lords it has a lot to do with it because against this amendment the minister has been arguing that one has to be so careful about the palaces and about their environmental state <e> <s> he then went on to the question of security and said that we would need tested people <e> <s> security can apply in just the same way as it does at the moment <e> <s> presumably the commission would be dealing with many people who were ex-civil servants and had been transferred <e> <s> it is very interesting that there has been this hardened line and that the government will not accept what is only an enabling clause <e> <s> like other noble lords i am quite amazed about this <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we should get one point quite clear <e> <s> as i understand it the minister spoke about his amendment <e> <s> did the noble duke then move the amendment to which some of us have attached our names <e> <s> there is an amendment in his name <e> <s> are we discussing that amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make my point on this amendment <e> <s> i also am grateful to the minister for what i am sure is the intention to meet what a number of us particularly the noble lord lord digby and myself were concerned about in committee <e> <s> the noble earl at column of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that explanation <e> <s> i am not sure at the moment that i feel that it is adequate <e> <s> i will read what he has said about it look at it again and in the meantime beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords naturally like the noble lord lord montagu i should have been happier if the government had found it possible or decided to accept the amendment <e> <s> i think they should have done because it is something that at some point some government has to grapple with <e> <s> every year an enormous amount of money is spent by the psa more than the sum spent by all the other property companies one can think of put together <e> <s> therefore there is not only an aesthetic and visual side but an important financial side to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his clear reply <e> <s> i am very disappointed by it because as i said this has been tempered down to the commissions requests <e> <s> i still fail to see that what is possibly done on scheduled monuments cannot be done with listed buildings <e> <s> it again raises what is a basic question <e> <s> we raised the point over the royal palaces and other instances throughout the bill <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> i am glad that he is going to look at this and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords these are very complicated amendments i agree and perhaps shorthanding them did not really help <e> <s> but the first paragraph of amendment reads <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to thank the minister for what he said about amendments nos <e> <s> and and secondly to ask him whether he is expecting to bring forward the amendments by third reading <e> <s> i thank the noble earl for indicating that he will <e> <s> as has been said before it is very important that we should get as much of this amended as possible before the bill leaves here and goes to another place <e>", "<cs> my lords after that government reply it is almost impossible to carry the discussion very much further <e> <s> i very much went along with a great deal of what the noble lord lord sandford said about this problem <e> <s> i quite understand the government deciding that they do not want to push the royal commission into a position where it is subsumed by the heritage commission because one is royal and i have not yet suggested calling the heritage commission the royal heritage commission and upgrading it to that extent <e> <s> so there is a problem here <e>", "<cs> my lords in these circumstances i think it would be quite wrong even if it were feasible at this time of night to press this amendment at all <e> <s> at this stage i think we have to hand it back to the government in order to try to start some sort of working relationship or have more talks or to say you do not have to do anything about this at all we have been able to make arrangements and to consult about this and not put it on any statutory basis at all <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way for a moment <e> <s> i have listened to most of this debate <e> <s> a great many points have been raised in fact an astonishing number from all over the house criticising the bill <e> <s> i am being quite serious when i say that what we want to hear are the governments answers to those points <e> <s> we do not really want to hear this evening although at some other time we might a wide discourse on the water industry generally or on water generally <e> <s> the remarks as regards the press have not been answered the remarks made on what was said by the minister when he first introduced the bill <e> <s> with great respect i would ask the noble lord if he could keep to answering points made on the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for repeating the statement and for placing in the library a copy of the letter sent to chief executives of local authorities <e> <s> when his right honourable friend the minister of housing introduced the airey house issue in another place <e> <s> he said it was a unique problem <e> <s> it is rather worrying that now within a comparatively short time these defects have been found in the orlit houses of which there are in england and wales <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for repeating the statement made in another place <e> <s> we are all aware that the country views with great misgivings the prolongation of this potentially exceptionally grave dispute <e> <s> what we all fervently want to see is an early and honourable end to the dispute before any major damage and personal and industrial hardship have taken place <e> <s> the secretary of state in his statement said that it was still on a small scale but for those people involved it is absolutely catastrophic at this time and for our industries <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i could intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords the point i wished to emphasise was that when i said the negotiations had not been real i was repeating a point that had been underlined in the quotation i gave from the acas report and the point was also made by the noble baroness lady seear namely that when there is such a complete muddle that people do not know what to expect they were told there might be rises of between and a week then they were told that the sum would be p and because of the structure of the industry it is difficult to know what it will be across the board then it is a great pity and i am not happy about it that negates the effect of the negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank the noble lord lord renton who in a very succinct way said exactly what i wanted to hear <e> <s> i was not sure whether the minister was accepting it or not <e> <s> but i now take it that the amendment is acceptable but that it is a question of weaving it right through the bill which means that it will then come up in the commons presumably then as a government amendment <e> <s> may i say something in answer to the two points about heritage raised by the noble lord lord winstanley <e> <s> it is not a question of my disliking the word or feeling that it should not be used but there was a feeling that there could be some confusion with the national heritage memorial fund indeed the chairman the noble lord lord charteris said he was not happy about it <e> <s> it has also been used by a great many other bodies and this proposal seems to tailor it down <e> <s> the noble lord lord winstanley made the point that one could do better <e> <s> i am sure one could but up to this point nobody has and that is the trouble <e> <s> i am grateful to the government for accepting this change and i hope to see it woven into the bill when it goes to another place <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for his very happy reply <e> <s> i am delighted that <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is perfectly correct <e> <s> i did not move my amendment because following the discussion on report on the amendment i then moved to bring in conservation the government have come forward with their amendment <e> <s> i am delighted to see it and i thank the minister for bringing it forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his explanation <e> <s> taking the last point first i am glad that in answer to the noble lord lord strathcona he had the opportunity to underline again what he said originally <e> <s> i am sure that it is not beyond the skill of the lawyers to find a way of making the wording clear <e> <s> that is essential and i assume that it will be tackled in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i also welcome this amendment particularly the trading aspects of it and the fact that the commission can keep the receipts <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not have any intention of pressing the amendment <e> <s> the minister was right i was trying to find a more acceptable version than the one that was moved on report <e> <s> i am not totally convinced that this one is absolutely right <e> <s> but i think the minister appreciates that we are trying to get the balance between the commission having as much freedom as they can and at the same time having the long stop upon which the minister and the government are insisting all the time of accountability to the secretary of state <e> <s> it is difficult but i think we have pointed out throughout the bill that this is one of the very large problems with which we have to grapple <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to everything that has been said in debating the amendment including the remarks of the noble lord lord montagu who stopped in midstream as it were in moving the amendment the statement of the minister the noble lord lord adeane and my noble friend lord beswick and i am sorry if i have irritated my noble friend in dealing with this issue <e> <s> the situation is i would say very much clearer now that the government have spoken forth on it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think this is a great improvement on the original wording in the bill and support it entirely <e>", "<cs> my lords as i think i moved the amendment on report to try to produce this result i am extremely grateful and welcome this amendment very much particularly paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot agree with the minister when he takes the point of definition because <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not angry i am just weary <e> <s> all mounted up together what it proves is that there are some very important and difficult problems that have not yet been resolved <e> <s> they will have to be resolved if the commission is to do its work properly if the local authorities are to be able to do their work without having an extra burden and if the department is not to be kept busy duplicating everybodys work and being showered with a load of papers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the government are taking that view on this amendment <e> <s> it raises a very fundamental query as to whether there is sufficient merit in setting up this commission if they are to be hamstrung in this way <e> <s> it is one thing to have two advisory bodies with the department doing the decision-making but it seems to be both wrong and quite absurd to hive off a commission as a more or less independent and autonomous body and then to keep clawing back part of the tools which they need in order to do their proper job <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords again the ministers reply does not surprise me <e> <s> however this amendment which does not contravene any planning law inhibitions or local authority objections is rather ingenious and i should have thought the government would have had the imagination and creativity to recognise it as such and accept it <e> <s> as for the grey areas when the minister reads the report of this debate i believe he will find that they are not grey areas but charcoal bordering on black <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot accept that explanation because the minister himself said that the responses received were evenly balanced and the government decided to come down on one side rather than the other <e> <s> with great respect the constitutional element is a bit heavy-handed <e> <s> whether or not it is an appeal system as the minister called it by another name does not matter <e> <s> if it is it means that there is still the right to go to the secretary of state <e> <s> there is therefore accountability <e> <s> the commission is being fined down to just a handmaiden or perhaps i should say a handperson of the secretary of state and the department with a tremendously expensive number of slaves in both places <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say a few words at this last stage of the bill <e> <s> i may say i am speaking about the second half of the bill my noble friend lord strabolgi wants to say a few words about the first half of the bill <e> <s> we all know pirandellos play <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that when the homeless persons act went on the statute book it was in the context of very much more housebuilding in this country than we have at the present moment <e> <s> would the noble lord not agree that with the diminution of the voluntary housing areas with the sale of the rowton houses-and i believe there is also one in birmingham-the whole situation is getting worse and worse <e> <s> are the government aware of the number of single homeless people is it being monitored <e> <s> are the government going to do something to enable the local authorities to provide accommodation <e> <s> without government help and without voluntary organisations being able to keep up their level of assistance the problem is going to increase and become worse <e>", "<cs> i agree that this has been an extremely interesting and wide-ranging debate <e> <s> it

sandford said about the two separate committees which with great respect seem to have got a bit confused in the governments mind as well <e>", "<cs> i understood the minister to say that there would be a report of the minutes of the proceedings <e> <s> a report of minutes is quite different from the minutes themselves a report as i understand it would be an edited version <e> <s> or have i misunderstood the noble lord <e>", "<cs> anote is not the same <e> <s> does he mean the actual minutes will be repeated <e> <s> otherwise a note could mean a selective version <e>", "<cs> exactly <e>", "<cs> my lords it is late in the evening but the business that we are discussing tonight is so miserable and of such importance that we are extremely grateful to the noble lord lord bethell for raising it <e> <s> practically every newspaper of whatever political view going straight across the spectrum <e>", "<cs> my lords i just put it forward that it was reported in the newspapers that the romanian embassy here said that he was not a romanian <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister really saying that someone who has spent nine out of years in prison in romania has motives that are entirely for economic improvement <e> <s> it just does not make sense to us or to anyone else <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first congratulate the minister on introducing his twenty-first bill to this house <e> <s> now that he has passed the milestone and reached what in the old days used to be his majority perhaps we shall find him rather more willing to give way on this bill than on the other that he has brought before us <e> <s> having said that this bill which the noble lord has presented so cogently i find profoundly disappointing because it does not address itself to the fundamental housing problems <e>", "<cs> those which are not the recipients of government support or have not received public <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord is going to write to a number of noble lords and i think that most of us who spoke are now here and will not see those replies which i understand in the interest of brevity could he circulate for instance what he is going to write to the noble lords lord prys-davies lord goodman and others <e> <s> we are all concerned about charities and the law <e> <s> this would help the noble lord and enable us to study this aspect at greater leisure and clear it up <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will give way i have been very restrained is he really saying that everybody who spoke against the government on clause today was misunderstanding or misrepresenting the bill and the clause <e>", "<cs> my lords before the house divides i should like to refer to what the minister has said and i have read what he said in committee <e> <s> unfortunately i was not present on the first day of the committee stage <e> <s> i am bothered and bewildered but certainly not bewitched <e> <s> the minister makes it quite clear that county and district councils will be invited to <e>", "<cs> if i had been in any doubt at all about this amendment or thought that it was unnecessary the remarks of the noble baroness lady trumpington would immediately have brought me to my feet <e> <s> unfortunately i was not here for the first day of the committee stage but i would certainly have given the strongest support to the original amendment <e> <s> i must declare a sort of interest since i am still a paid-up member of the nuj although work in this house seems to prevent me from putting it to much use <e> <s> the noble baroness spoke first about emasculating the role of the board but it will be a pretty weak board if what is written in the press is going to emasculate it <e> <s> she also mentioned a paper like <e>", "<cs> i have been a reporter in my time and i wrote down exactly what the noble baroness said <e> <s> what i am saying is that it is not the business of individual periodicals or of the press generally to be impartial <e> <s> that is what a free press is all about <e> <s> there are different views put by different organs of the press <e> <s> that is what we have at the moment <e> <s> we have the <e>", "<cs> i have one point to raise following the ministers reply which of course had to be quite long <e> <s> i am extremely concerned because he said that he could not accept subsection g referring to complaints to the ombudsman <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend lady serota will wish to comment on this <e> <s> when the bill was first before us the whole question of reference to the ombudsman was left out <e> <s> it is now in the bill <e> <s> to leave this matter to government flexibility or guidelines or whatever other step the government may wish to take seems completely wrong <e> <s> if anything should be on the face of the bill it is subsection g <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord not agree that the funds made available for prize money could possibly be better used if allocated as a system of grants since this would encourage a wider range of self-help activities in rural areas <e> <s> is he also aware that this approach has the support of rural voice which as i am sure he knows is an alliance of nine national organisations representing rural communities and interests right across the field <e>", "<cs> my lords when the home office refuses an asylum application would they give full details of the reasons for the refusal since not only is this justice but it would enable the person refused to get assistance in approaching other countries which might take a different view from the home office <e> <s> while we are delighted that the home office is now going to inform the united kingdom immigrants advisory service when it intends to refuse an application for asylum would it not be even more appropriate to inform the service as soon as the individual has been interviewed and before the home office comes to a decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support my noble friend lady jeger <e> <s> she is absolutely right and on to a good point about rebates <e> <s> if one of the alternative answers is to have ones water metered as some people do now because they find it less costly someone still has to pay for the installation of the meter <e> <s> it is these people who cannot afford to pay for the installation of the meter who will be at a great financial disadvantage <e> <s> this is another item which should be included with rate and rent rebates and the other schemes of rebate for people in financial need <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not ask a question <e> <s> i said it would be too expensive for people who would require or deserve a rebate to install a meter <e> <s> i am saying that to the minister so that he does not have to spend time answering a question that i did not ask <e> <s> i stated a fact <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to speak to this amendment but i am surprised at the governments attitude to it <e> <s> this is part of amendment no <e> <s> which was moved by the noble lord lord sandford most of which will now go into the guidelines <e> <s> but this amendment was quite deliberately picked out and moved separately because there is such strong feeling that it should be on the face of the bill <e> <s> my noble friend lady serota explained the matter so well that it is unnecessary for me to take up the time of the house by going over it again <e> <s> however the minister said that this would have no practical effect that they are smaller authorities <e> <s> the fact that the authorities are smaller makes out a case for the consumer consultative committees to be given more responsibility <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for explaining this amendment <e> <s> as he says it makes very little difference to the bill and even the point which he says was a more substantial one is not the aspect that is worrying us all <e> <s> there are a number of amendments which follow which seek with the best possible intentions to modify this clause <e> <s> personally and this is no discourtesy to the movers of these amendments i shall not be speaking to them and i believe that some of my noble friends may take the same view <e> <s> we feel and this view is shared by many across the committee that the whole clause is really the problem in this bill <e> <s> at this stage of the proceedings there does not seem to be a great deal of point in trying to prune the branches of what is an extremely unhealthy tree <e>", "<cs> we could in fact have approached this debate on clause stand part by deleting the first part of clause but we felt that it was only fair to the movers of the other amendments that they should have a fair hearing <e> <s> here i must apologise to the noble lord lord coleraine <e> <s> i did not quite understand his amendment when i saw it in print i had a slight idea what it was about but if he would like to separate his amendment from the other amendments that is fine <e> <s> to debate this on clause stand part enables the movers of other amendments to have a fair hearing <e> <s> it also enables the minister to give if i may put it this way a few winks out of the back of his head about what he might be prepared to accept in the future if this clause stands <e> <s> but it does not alter the anxiety and disquiet we all feel about the clause <e>", "<cs> from these benches i support the amendment moved despite the noble baroness lady seear having referred to us as elderly orphans <e> <s> unfortunately an orphan i now am but i try to pretend that i am not all that elderly <e> <s> nevertheless i feel that this is something that should be in the bill and should be spelled out in this way <e> <s> as the noble baroness said in moving the amendment it could be argued and probably will be that there is a general responsibility in the act in the reference to conditions under which a court could consider it reasonable to make an order but that is really rather a large generalisation <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if i misunderstood but i was sure that that was what the noble baroness meant <e> <s> although it is true that very often when this happens local authorities make sure that a person is not rendered homeless in this way or put into rather inferior accommodation i feel that unless the government can come up with a very good reason to the contrary this provision should be put in the bill and should be clearly in the statute <e>", "<cs> i waited to hear what the minister had to say about this amendment <e> <s> while i appreciate very much how the two noble baronesses feel about it i must confess that tonight my tribute is to the noble viscount lord ingleby who also speaking from a very strong personal experience of being disabled yet took an entirely contrary line a line which we certainly support <e>", "<cs> words almost fail me on this amendment <e> <s> i suppose the next step will be that the government will be giving houses away with a pound of tea or coffee <e> <s> it is quite amazing <e> <s> when the act was going through this house we had a tremendous battle over the discounts and over the figure of per cent <e> <s> going up to per cent <e> <s> then suddenly this bill is produced there is no talk in the bill itself of any increase in the discount and after going through the commons it comes here and on wednesday of last week an amendment was tabled by the government which increased the discount from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e>", "<cs> the noble lord said that they have nothing <e> <s> however we are discussing an amendment which increases the discount from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> it is quite ridiculous for the minister to say that they have nothing <e> <s> they will have the per cent <e> <s> discount anyhow <e> <s> what we are discussing and arguing about at the moment is that the per cent <e> <s> should be increased to per cent <e> <s> that can only be for purely political reasons <e> <s> otherwise let the minister tell me why this was not in the bill originally and explained at second reading <e>", "<cs> i am not entirely clear about this <e> <s> is this a form of a further subsidy to the tenants <e> <s> putting further costs on to the local authority seems to be an additional burden on them <e> <s> the end of the new subsection states <e>", "<cs> it is getting a little late and we have all been dealing with the bill for some hours <e> <s> i should like to reserve our position on this particular amendment and read when i am probably clearer-headed what the noble lord has said <e> <s> if necessary i shall return to the matter on report <e>", "<cs> is it not true that when this comes into effect it could result in higher rates <e> <s> is it not the case that financially this could be one of the results <e>", "<cs> i think that i shall have to read what the minister has said <e> <s> this is a complicated matter <e> <s> i am not satisfied either with the reply to myself or with the reply to my noble friend lady fisher <e> <s> but i will have the opportunity possibly of coming back on report <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> all my noble friend said is absolutely right and i quite agree with him <e> <s> what is now happening is that as both he and i pointed out and the <e>", "<cs> i agree that it is shadow boxing <e> <s> i think the noble lord lord bellwin agrees with me that there is not much point at this stage in prolonging the debate <e> <s> he intends to bring forward examples <e> <s> i too have examples which seem to me to be rather unfair <e> <s> parliament decided quite specifically by a considerable majority in this house that the dwellinghouse should be suitable <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but i have become confused <e> <s> when did the noble lord the minister speak to this <e> <s> on what amendment was it <e>", "<cs> is not that tied up with amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but i do not follow <e> <s> would the noble lord mind explaining how lines and being left out fit in with the other amendments <e> <s> i am sorry if he has to say it again <e> <s> i would be grateful if i could be clear about this point <e>", "<cs> are they unnecessary because they are incorporated in the other amendment <e> <s> the power of local authorities to contribute towards certain mortgage costs goes out and it has been placed with the other amendment regarding the tenants <e> <s> is that so <e>", "<cs> what about the statutory declarations <e> <s> does that provision disappear entirely <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord the minister probably has the answer to it in his notes <e> <s> this is leaving out statutory declarations <e> <s> is that included somewhere else in amendment no <e> <s> or does it disappear altogether <e> <s> we have the answer to the first point the power of local authorities to contribute towards certain mortgage costs <e> <s> it is now the statutory declarations <e> <s> if we could get that out of the way i think it would help us to go faster <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord very much <e>", "<cs> may i from these benches thank the minister very much for the statement he has made <e> <s> i think that on this occasion the government are absolutely right <e> <s> the feeling in the house was clear <e> <s> it is a great help and advantage to us all to know the governments intentions at this stage <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to everyone who has spoken <e> <s> i appreciate that it is an extremely complex matter <e> <s> in view of the undertaking i shall certainly not press the amendment at this stage <e> <s> if possible i should like to feel along with all those who are concerned about the matter that the minister will be in touch with us before report stage to enable us to know that something will happen <e> <s> i am certain that the noble lord appreciates that to have a ping-pong situation between the matrimonial side and the housing side may have a great deal of merit so far as the law is concerned but it is no comfort to the people concerned <e> <s> nothing that has been suggested covers the problem of the cohabitees <e> <s> in the hope of further reassurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his reply and also everyone else who has spoken in the debate <e> <s> it is quite clear that throughout the committee there is a sense of unease about the clause as it stands <e> <s> it is rather a pity that the discussions which we now understand are to take place did not take place before this clause was put in the bill <e> <s> the time for discussions was when the principles of the scheme as it affects both tenants and landlords were worked out because it is a crucial and very complicated matter <e> <s> sensible and workable arrangements could be worked out but with respect they should have been worked out before the bill was brought before us or in fact even printed <e> <s> however in view of the ministers reply and as i understand it his reply to my noble friend that it is accepted that the position is unsatisfactory as it stands at the moment at this stage i shall withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i was slightly worried because it sounded a little sinister when the minister said that there was a full answer given in column <e> <s> as i understood it this refers both to the previous amendment and to the one now moved by my noble friend if the minister is really going to look at them i was assuming perhaps naively that they were going to be looked at perhaps with the mind opened once again <e> <s> but if he is going to fall back once more on what has been said and let us face it most of these matters were turned down in committee in another place then i think we would take a rather tougher view on this <e>", "<cs> as i understood him the noble lord said that he would write to the noble lord lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> i do not think that that is quite good enough <e> <s> i welcome the spirit of what is intended in the clause <e> <s> i am afraid i had reached the stage of thinking that it was part of the clause and i did not entirely understand the way in which it was described <e> <s> but when two eminent lawyers opposite point out problems in the drafting of this clause it creates a great worry and it should be taken back for redrafting <e> <s> i do not think that a letter teaching the noble lord lord campbell of alloway and the noble lord lord renton how to find their way round the clause is the answer <e> <s> if they have difficulty about some points then i must ask the minister to take the clause back <e>", "<cs> i believe the noble lord said that he spoke to this amendment on clause but we did so much work the other day that i have no recollection whatsoever of it <e> <s> i am sure that he did so but i do not have what he said in front of me at the moment <e> <s> i am rather concerned about the amendment because once again the intention is to subsidise further the mortgage costs of tenants at the expense of the landlords financing <e> <s> that means that some local authorities will be contributing towards <e>", "<cs> i should like to support that which has been said by the noble earl and the noble lord opposite because we have encountered this same problem in other parts of this bill <e> <s> it is very difficult when matters are prescribed in regulations which are <e>", "<cs> i think that it is clear from what the minister has said and he has been quite frank about it that the government are not intending to move on this <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl lord caithness who asked me not to press this amendment will accept there is no point in our waiting for the next step because if the minister was going to have new thoughts on it i think that he would have quite frankly said so now <e> <s> he always does do that <e>", "<cs> we have had quite a long and interesting debate on this subject <e> <s> i agree with the noble earl that in many parts of the bill the wording is very flexible and this is particularly so in this instance <e> <s> i do not think that anything the minister has said has convinced any of us it certainly has not convinced me and my noble friends <e> <s> the present wording permits a wide range of bodies able to supply different criteria different views and differing degrees of discipline <e> <s> we are asking and i think that my noble friend answered very well the point made by the noble lord lord swinfen for one body to apply consistent standards but this one body as i was careful to explain would be more of a panel of different professional people with all the different expertise which the noble lord mentioned <e>", "<cs> the noble earl is quite right my later amendment is slightly different but is on the same lines <e> <s> we are again back to the minister saying that we should keep this as flexible as possible <e> <s> i say once again that we are in what my noble friend has called a grey <e>", "<cs> i do not think listening to what the minister has said in reply to my noble friend that it is really correct it is not provided in the bill and that is why we are moving this amendment <e> <s> we have to <e>", "<cs> i think that we are back again in the trap that we keep on coming to in this bill the flexibility and open-endedness of it <e> <s> we are in an entirely different situation <e> <s> we are not in the same situation with the local authority having complete control over all this <e> <s> we are in a situation now where there is privatisation and where there are approved inspectors <e> <s> the stop notice would give the local authority some breathing space and would also encourage the developer to reconcile things and work things out with the approved inspector <e> <s> as we see it the end result of the amendment ought to avoid the involvement of the local authority <e> <s> in fact it ought to help things along once a building owner has decided to take the private certifier route <e> <s> the minister said that the provision will be in regulations <e> <s> as i have said before there is a point beyond which it is difficult for us to accept so much government by regulation <e> <s> plans will have to be deposited <e> <s> but if that is so it seems to <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the support of the noble viscount lord hanworth and also of my noble friend <e> <s> i thought that they both put the case extremely well and stressed the importance and gravity of what is being done and how the bill would look without this amendment <e> <s> it is true that local authorities have been permitting or refusing relaxation for some time and they will continue to do so in their own right and for approved inspectors after the bill becomes law if in fact it does <e>", "<cs> even if the minister is correct having listened carefully to what has been said and having read the clause it seems there is enough doubt in it either for the minister to be able to go back or explain exactly what it does mean which does not seem to be entirely clear <e> <s> if there is no reason for the anxieties which have been expressed and which i really think are well placed at the moment so far as the present wording is concerned then it would seem that that part of the clause certainly needs redrafting <e> <s> one of the interesting things which has arisen from this discussion if we ignore for a moment its substantive point is that it is quite unclear <e> <s> if something can give rise to so much misunderstanding certainly among the people who have spoken who are though few all extremely knowledgeable in this field then there is something wrong with the way it is set down <e>", "<cs> my lords may i refer back to the first part of my noble friends question about the growing problem of londons homeless <e> <s> in the ministers reply did he not say that the government are undertaking something and that it would be through the voluntary housing movement <e> <s> i may not have quoted his exact words <e> <s> may we be informed at what speed this is being taken by the government <e> <s> can the minister give an estimate of the number of londons homeless what sort of provision is to be made and how many units will come out of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted with this amendment because i think at the end of the day after we had had a lot of tries at finding a better and less cumbersome name that i suggested this name <e> <s> i felt that it was the best we could get out of very difficult phrasing in the way of trying to get something shorter and a little crisper <e> <s> unfortunately we could not either here or in another place find a further way of cutting it or making the name rather more jaunty <e> <s> but i am very glad that in another place they agreed with what we decided here <e>", "<cs> my lords i support what has been said by the noble lord lord montagu of beaulieu particularly about the wider trading powers <e> <s> at third reading i remember that we said we wanted these trading powers to be expanded in the way that they now are so this is a great improvement <e> <s> i am delighted turning to amendment no <e> <s> that local government has been included <e> <s> we spent some time on this matter <e> <s> many of us were anxious that a representative of local government should be on the face of the bill <e> <s> that is now so <e> <s> turning to amendment no <e> <s> and the exemption of the commission from controls could the minister tell me whether under this or any other legislation there is any procedure non-statutory if necessary whereby national amenity societies or other bodies are able to call into question any excess of zeal which they think the commission have displayed over for example restoring an ancient building if they feel the commission may be destroying with good intentions nevertheless the very thing they are seeking to preserve by doing too much <e> <s> is no public inquiry procedure to be available to the secretary of state so that such matters can be argued in public as they should be <e> <s> i doubt whether this would happen very frequently <e> <s> i should have given notice to the minister of this question if i had thought sooner about this point <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> i had taken it a stage further to being able to set up a public inquiry <e> <s> however the indication which the minister has given will be understood by the new commission <e> <s> if however the minister finds that what i have said has been covered or could be covered in the future perhaps he will write to me about it <e> <s> i do not propose at this stage to hold up the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i remember that at committee and report stages in this house we had quite a lot of discussion on the question of terms of employment under the proposed new set up <e> <s> i expressed some of the comments and anxieties which had been conveyed to me by the unions on this question <e> <s> the amendments we now have before us both clarify the whole situation and i hope put to rest many of the very real anxieties and concerns that were expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords could the minister tell us why the government did not place an immediate ban on the importation of these barrels a power which they have under the control of pollution act <e> <s> secondly since representatives of county councils and port authorities recently told a select committee of your lordships house that they are not satisfied with the governments promises to close the loopholes could the minister reassure the house that the present regulations governing the importation of dangerous chemicals are adequate <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister what figures he was working from <e> <s> the latest figures i have been able to find relate to the situation in and one cannot get any later figures from his department <e> <s> i agree with everybody that any waste of housing under whatever government is a very bad thing with the housing waiting lists as they are <e> <s> is it true that these figures are due to over-eager purchase in the late s <e> <s> does he agree that the per cent <e> <s> reduction in the housing investment programme between and including a moratorium has had an effect as has also the operation of the project control system whereby many of the local authorities which have asked to carry out this work to make houses habitable have been rejected by the doe <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am sorry i am separating the right reverend prelate from my noble friend lord soper <e> <s> there was a mistake on the list <e> <s> i also should like to thank my noble friend lord longford for initiating this debate <e> <s> i remember his encouragement to me many years ago when i made my maiden speech in this house and that was on penal reform at that time <e> <s> i do not think i need in this debate to be very long on the state of our prisons <e> <s> it is only too well known and we are concerned with a rather different subject although obviously one cannot avoid saying something about the prisons <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i have misunderstood the minister <e> <s> he said that the reports should be strictly where custody was being considered <e> <s> but surely it is not the intention to cut down on reports where one wants to see whether the offender is suitable for probation a fine or a community service order <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i certainly do not think that he is naive unfortunately <e> <s> in fact i believe that he has never been naive and i do not think that he is likely to be <e> <s> is he aware that only per cent <e> <s> of total glc expenditure is spent on administrators and that those people who are remunerated in excess of are a very small proportion <e> <s> is it not also true that if the <e>", "<cs> my lords while appreciating the delicacy of the negotiations may i ask whether the minister is aware that i know there have always been great problems regarding actions not necessarily of this sort in dealing with foreign embassies <e> <s> can he say to what extent progress has been made by the fco with iran and what further pressures can be brought to bear <e> <s> is it not true and i think that the minister has said so that if it were not an embassy a repairs notice could certainly have been served <e> <s> although i appreciate the problems we should like to be more satisfied that some action is being taken <e> <s> if they ignore this what action will be taken in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords on this occasion the opposition are able to welcome the bill put forward by <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down since she commented on some of the points i made i am sure she would agree that even the authorities who are getting in as she quite rightly said a much larger amount of rates have tremendous demands made on them with larger populations <e> <s> their geographical position and also their needs for expansion and the possibilities for industrial and commercial expansion are very important not only locally but nationally as well <e> <s> i think the noble baroness knows too much about it all to stand on what sounded at times rather like generalisations <e> <s> i hope she did not mean to generalise about the whole of london or the whole of these big cities <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not the point i was making <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister finished on that point <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the minister has in his last remark covered the points that i wanted to draw to his attention that there has been consultation with the local authority associations and that this will continue <e> <s> but is he aware that we on these benches will certainly be very unhappy to see this bill which is a small bill for a particular purpose to legalise something about which there was some doubt used as a vehicle to do something for which it was not meant to be used at all <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the minister agree that extra work has been put on local authorities <e> <s> for instance the administration of the unified housing benefit scheme and mortgage interest relief at source <e> <s> are not local authorities now responsible for statutory sick pay and has there not been an increase in the police force <e> <s> also is there not a great deal of work to be done by the officials concerned with the problems of youth unemployment <e> <s> in those circumstances would not the minister agree that the local authorities have made a magnificent effort <e>", "<cs> may i intervene before the minister replies <e> <s> i listened very carefully to what the minister said in reply to the amendment moved by the noble lord lord kilmarnock and i must confess that i agree wth almost everything he said <e> <s> we have to get right back to the beginning of what this small bill is about <e> <s> it is to clarify a doubt which arose on whether local authorities would be in legal difficulties if they used section of the local government act for urban grant development <e> <s> with that doubt remaining numbers of local authorities of all political complexions are concerned about continuing with work which is extremely important to the development of the economy and indeed to employment <e>", "<cs> i want to speak only very briefly to this land amendment part of the upshot of which i think was not explained by the noble lord lord harris <e> <s> it means in fact that every transaction regarding land which comes within the clause would have to go to the secretary of state <e> <s> it really is the most ludicrous and outrageous suggestion <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the minister for repeating a statement made by the secretary of state in another place <e> <s> the statement is of the greatest importance to everyone in the country not only to those people living close to the sites to which the minister has referred who naturally feel more strongly about the matter <e> <s> the select committee on science and technology in its report published in july stated clearly <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that in the debates in this house on the last local government miscellaneous provisions act my colleagues and i tried very hard to get some control written into the act on this very point but we were turned down all the time by the government <e> <s> can the minister perhaps look back on those debates because he may find that there are some very useful amendments on which he could now legislate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure we are all grateful to the noble lord lord beloff for asking us today to address ourselves to the present state of relations between central and local government <e> <s> unfortunately the relations particularly in some areas are achieving the status of a broken marriage <e> <s> we hope that it will not end in a complete divorce which would be very bad for the country <e> <s> the interest shown in this subject can be gauged by the number of speakers who have put their names down today <e> <s> i am delighted that my noble friend lord graham of edmonton will be making his maiden speech later on this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has made his point about the selective scheme with which i do not happen to agree although i can see the secretary of states point <e> <s> but in that case why is the secretary of <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord lord bellwin replies can he be rather more specific <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i must say this in the absence of my noble friend lady fisher <e> <s> i listened very carefully to what she said and i think she was saying that rates many of them did not play as important a part in the costings of businesses as the government have made out <e> <s> more businesses are in trouble or have gone bankrupt because of the financial and monetary policies of the government than because of rates <e>", "<cs> my lords since the government want the glc spending for reduced by million or per cent <e> <s> will he agree that the glc has said that such drastic cuts can only be achieved by among other things putting up london transport fares by per cent <e> <s> ending all grants to community and voluntary groups not just the controversial ones ending concessionary fares for old people and cutting the fire service <e> <s> does the minister say that that is being completely careless about money <e> <s> how much will the glc services cost the london boroughs when the glc is abolished as these are i am sure he will agree essential services that i have listed <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true then that the under-spending which should be returned to the glc by way of block grant by the government has not yet made its appearance and it is not known whether it will be received by next summer when the rate support grant has already been arranged <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that although speed is essential the quality of decisions is equally important <e> <s> as in certain cases an authority may reject an application in eight weeks and therefore get a good mark for speed whereas more extended negotiations with the applicant could result in an approved application and reduce the costs and the time involved in appeals <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the minister swept so broadly aside any argument for a more lengthy time for applications <e> <s> will he not agree that there are certain cases where if the applicant can get together with the authority and the developer and there can be further negotiations an approved application can then be arranged <e> <s> would he not accept that that surely is much better than a decision going to appeal and the whole process being started all over again with the costs and time involved <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that as i made quite clear i am not making a general case for it i am saying that there are cases where flexibility ought to be encouraged <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> we naturally welcome the extension of assistance to the categories that he mentioned <e> <s> however i would point out that some of the worst houses were built after and are not subject to these proposals for example bison and the bisf houses <e> <s> can the minister say whether there are any plans for these <e> <s> by restricting the legislation as paragraph of the statement states to provide assistance for owners of houses which have been sold to those owners by the public sector it means that council house tenants are completely excluded <e> <s> most of these houses are in local authority ownership <e> <s> the quantification of the problem on a national basis is houses with repair bills amounting to around billion <e> <s> this is the result of an ama report which i am sure is well known to the minister <e> <s> does not the minister agree that this will have devastating effects on council house rents as local authority houses are not going to be helped <e> <s> is it not unfair to ask council house tenants to bear this burden <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister did not answer the question which i asked as regards clarification about the statement <e> <s> at the bottom of paragraph it says <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord to ask him a point of fact at this stage <e> <s> he refers to the all-party repeal group <e> <s> it is something unknown to me and i think it is important to the debate <e> <s> is this a committee established by the house of lords or is it just an informal group of like-minded peers <e>", "<cs> my lords may i start by thanking the noble lord lord vaizey for his courtesy in sending me a copy of his speech or at least two-thirds of it <e> <s> it was very helpful <e> <s> the noble lord has a nice quirky sense of humour <e> <s> i enjoy exchanging remarks and comments with him outside the chamber but i do not think this should extend to legislative measures <e> <s> i can only believe that he has his tongue firmly in his cheek when he brings this bill to the house <e> <s> the very title of the bill is a classic example of what george orwell called newspeak <e> <s> the title of the bill states it is a bill that repeals legislation restricting the freedom of tenants <e> <s> but this bill repeals legislation that protects the tenants not restricts their freedom <e>", "<cs> my lords it may not be inconsistent with his view but if a committee of the house of commons on which i repeat the government party was in the majority had come to the conclusion from the evidence it heard and its own deliberations that the rent control acts were an important factor in the decline of the rented sector it would most certainly have said so <e> <s> the noble lord can read the account himself as i am sure he has done and he will see that point <e> <s> in fact it does not <e> <s> i do not think with the greatest respect that the noble lords intervention was valid <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will give way and i realise that it is getting late and do not want to elongate the debate i think he must agree that the whole situation in new york is entirely different from that in london <e> <s> in new york you have apartments with very high rents <e> <s> they have much more atradition of renting than home ownership because of the difference in space <e> <s> secondly has the noble lord seen some of the properties that people are renting at the lower end of the scale <e> <s> i imagine that he is talking about property around manhattan and that sort of area <e> <s> certainly nowhere in his quotations from the report of the environment committee does it state that a repeal of the rent control acts would improve or increase the quantity of rented housing <e> <s> in fact when the committee discuss it and the noble lord has read it all so i shall not go over it again they point out what has happened and also what would happen if this was reversed that it would not make the situation better but in fact would make it worse <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord mind reading the following sentence <e>", "<cs> my lords thank you <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate what the noble viscount has said but it is not good enough to say that one should support something which is quite wrong <e> <s> he described it as a vehicle and then suggests that all the parts that we find distasteful can be changed at committee stage <e> <s> this is completely impossible <e> <s> he must know this if he has read the bill and obviously he has and sees the repeals <e> <s> if he is arguing in favour of having just a discussion on it and perhaps coming forward with other recommendations that is different but we are discussing the bill before us <e> <s> we cannot be discussing whether we should give a second reading to something which may be turned on its head at committee stage <e> <s> that is not what we are discussing <e>", "<cs> my lords i have recently been on the same side as the noble earl on the subject of housing and i know that he has a great deal of compassion as well as common sense <e> <s> but how does he propose to deal with people who cannot afford what he might consider to be a moderate rent <e> <s> is he prepared to tell the government that they should increase public expenditure on house building in the public sector so that people of lower means can afford to rent a house and live in it <e> <s> otherwise they will be entirely squeezed out and the situation will get much worse <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord is overestimating <e> <s> furthermore this debate is about housing <e> <s> the noble lord has said that he will support the bill which i do not think has to do with anybodys income <e> <s> unfortunately he is as wrong about my financial status as he is about the bill <e>", "<cs> do not be so silly <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not really wish to interrupt the noble lord again but he cannot really compare going into sainsburys or any other shop with housing <e> <s> the reason why it is inequitable is because there is such a shortage of housing it is not a choice between one soup or another <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness not agree that it really is high time that there was a general review of the british nationality act as so many important amendments are needed to correct situations which have arisen and since the act has resulted in so much doubt injustice and hardship to so many people <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to thank the noble lord lord ashby for initiating this debate on the report of the european communities committee on <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to put the noble lord right on a point of fact <e> <s> my notes have been whipped away to <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to thank the minister for introducing the bill and for explaining it so clearly <e> <s> he did not have to spend much time on it because it really is not much of a bill it is a very small enabling bill <e> <s> i should like to welcome the news that at last something is being done for somerset house which has had a long and chequered history <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg the noble lords pardon yes it was the tate gallery <e> <s> the british museum had the prints anddrawings and i thought that the noble lord was interrupting me on that which they did not want shown in somerset house <e> <s> the opposition to this and this is the main point was so great that the matter was always left in limbo <e> <s> in the early s the rooms were done up they were beautifully restored at great expense <e> <s> it was heartbreaking to see the dust gather in those rooms in that wonderful building on a prime site on the river opposite the national theatre for people could have visited and enjoyed the building <e> <s> as the noble lord lord skelmersdale pointed out somerset house is part of our heritage and should be treated as such <e> <s> during this period only the london and thames exhibition did this building any real justice <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may have the indulgence of the house i should like to answer my noble friends first question <e> <s> i seem to be getting nil today in exams on accuracy <e> <s> he is absolutely right i am sorry that i shorthanded it but the collection was left to he used to the advantage of the country <e> <s> that is what i meant <e> <s> he is quite right and i had the pleasure of being shown the von seilern collection by him <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord spoke about the lease he confirmed what i put forward that a lease of not less than years is now being spoken of <e> <s> but i was arguing that a -year lease was far too short to enable the courtauld institute to move in try to obtain the money and have security of tenure <e> <s> i should like to hear from the minister whether a lease of years similar to that granted for the hamptons site will be discussed because that is not in the bill <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the under spending to which he refers has been practically eliminated and that there is a great prospect <e>", "<cs> my lords returning to the housing debate which was initiated by my noble friend lord pitt i should like first of all to thank him for introducing such a pressing and urgent motion and also to say how much i am looking forward to hearing the maiden speech of the noble lord lord cornwallis <e> <s> my noble friends account of the conditions which exist and the actions taken by government do not constitute a happy story <e> <s> unfortunately there is no rosy tale to tell <e> <s> i thought the noble lord lord byers backed this extraordinarily well and with great expedition <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord can explain what he means by that <e> <s> i am sure that he did not intend it but it came over as rather a snide remark <e> <s> i do not know what he meant about coming round to it <e> <s> we have never ever said that there should not be a right to buy <e> <s> all we are saying is that the right to buy should not be taken to the extreme where we do not have houses to rent for those people who cannot afford to buy <e>", "<cs> my lords we were not against the principle but rather against the legislation itself with the enormous discount <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friends amendment to delete these clauses in order to support the case for the family court <e> <s> the noble lord lord mcgregor mentioned judge graham hall and the work she has done on this <e> <s> something over years ago she and i wrote a pamphlet on the family court <e>", "<cs> following upon what the noble and learned lord has just said i can see why he dislikes the compulsory form of conciliation but as he himself pointed out it is very different from reconciliation <e> <s> we are talking here about the results of divorce proceedings which are by then a little more removed and the question of children <e> <s> i fail to be convinced by the noble and learned lords argument that there should not be a statutory provision <e> <s> if people refuse to meet no one will physically drag them together <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for repeating the statement made in another place <e> <s> it makes extremely gloomy news gloomy listening and it will make very gloomy reading <e> <s> the minister started by talking about local authority current spending exceeding the provisions made in the public expenditure white paper <e> <s> i should like to know what are the comparable figures for government overspending <e> <s> is it not true that local government spending has been kept in far greater control and check than government spending <e> <s> is it not also true that the increased amount of overspend is a half per cent <e> <s> of public expenditure and a quarter per cent <e> <s> of the gdp that is million <e> <s> talking in the global terms of the budget we are considering for this country that is just a drop in the ocean <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to answer just one brief question <e> <s> he pushed aside any talk of the cuts in social services of which i gave just a few examples <e> <s> can he tell me how those authorities which are not spending on what we might call municipal frivolities and who are being as careful as they can be are going to be able not only to reinstate the social services but keep up their really basic and most important services under the sort of cuts we have heard about today <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the weight of these coins is so heavy in ones purse or wallet that i have already worn through one and that they also fall out of my husbands pockets <e> <s> in view of inflation it is very expensive both to replace the trousers and to replace the wallet <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the minister is not aware that the school for advanced urban studies was set up by the department of the environment <e> <s> apart from the opposition in the noble lords own party and by the local authority associations which has been expressed today when the bill has been published is he aware that professor jones professor of government at the lse and professor john stewart professor of local government at birmingham in a recent paper demonstrated that the rate limitation proposals destroy the basis of local accountability <e> <s> it was this on which professor jones expounded on radio this morning <e> <s> can the noble lord find and let us know of any objective academic or other impartial specialist opinion which supports the governments proposals and the so-called reasoning in the white paper <e> <s> if so we should be grateful if he could let us know so that we can read it and find out from whom and where it comes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to come back again but is the minister really saying that these <e>", "<cs> i think it is quite clear what my noble friend lord houghton was trying to do although as the minister has said it may well be that the draftsmanship is not perfect <e> <s> but what i am concerned about here as i believe my noble friend is too is the question of how the lease will be finally worked out <e> <s> i can see the problems that have been raised by the minister but listening to what has been said i was struck by the fact that we have a unique situation with somerset house <e> <s> it is quite different for example from the british museum the national gallery or the tate <e> <s> here the secretary of state will grant a lease and it is under the guardianship of the department of the environment although in fact it is a public building which really belongs to the nation <e>", "<cs> how will one know when to ask the question <e>", "<cs> may i say <e>", "<cs> again i imagine that the minister will tell us that this amendment is unnecessary that there is no question of the fine rooms being used as a theatre museum at any time in the foreseeable or even the unforeseeable future <e> <s> that point was settled many years ago <e> <s> to go down the road of nostalgia perhaps i could remind my noble friend that in october i was the minister at the department of the environment who was responsible for somerset house <e> <s> when it was suggested that somerset house <e>", "<cs> i was deeply disappointed that the turner bequest did not go to somerset house but as i say that is water under the bridge <e> <s> there is now no possibility of either of those two things happening <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble lord lord skelmersdale for his reply <e> <s> i have just two points <e> <s> the noble lord kept repeating that it would all work out and that everybody will be happy all round <e> <s> but he was very careful not to mention any figure at all <e> <s> i wanted to hear him confirm and i do not see why he should not because it is written down that a lease in the region of years will be acceptable <e> <s> i think that is what i needed and i wanted to have that on record because this is what the whole discussion was about on second reading and what the noble lord took back he has been extremely helpful about the whole matter and done a great deal of work behind the scenes since then <e> <s> i think it is important for the institute certainly so far as its appeal is concerned because it feels very strongly that a lease of years or over is going to be of great benefit <e> <s> if that is what is in mind as i understand it is i cannot see any reason why the noble lord should not say that <e>", "<cs> that is perfectly acceptable <e> <s> i under stand of course that we cannot negotiate across dispatch boxes <e> <s> the noble lord has said as i hoped he would that in the region of years would be acceptable <e>", "<cs> may i say a word before we come to dividing the committee and other drastic steps <e> <s> it seems to me that my noble friend has some points in his amendment <e> <s> he has made it quite clear in answer to the noble lord lord mancroft that he is referring to long leases for commercial purpose <e> <s> i feel that he is right about that unless it got to the point where it was impossible to find another lessee <e> <s> for example the government bill does protect the fine rooms and requires their use for artistic or cultural purposes <e> <s> but when it goes on <e>", "<cs> it is not a question of a commercial adjunct <e> <s> i think we cleared that point <e> <s> the noble lord lord mancroft raised it and my noble friend lord houghton of sowerby answered the point <e> <s> we are concerned about the whole thing being handed over as a commercial enterprise <e> <s> that was the point <e> <s> my noble friend never suggested for one moment that the organisation should not be able to sell catalogues or anything else <e> <s> that goes without saying for any type of museum or gallery <e> <s> the proposal is really a safeguard <e>", "<cs> my lords i was waiting to see what the minister had to say hoping that he would either accept my noble friends amendment or come forward himself with something which was very similar but rather less abrasive than he thinks fit <e> <s> the noble lord the minister as my noble friend has pointed out i am looking at the relevant paragraph himself used the word and perhaps rather softer wording <e>", "<cs> my lords since the severe cut-backs in public expenditure are starving these homes and since the ministers reply has made it quite clear that this aspect does not have a high priority why do the government continue to penalise voluntary organisations by charging vat on maintenance and repair work in residential homes and sheltered housing for the elderly <e> <s> secondly the minister mentioned tax concessions on covenants <e> <s> why then do the government not make equal tax exemptions in respect of charitable donations <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect i am not sure that the minister heard my question aright <e> <s> the answer given may be in response to another question which has not been asked <e> <s> my question referred to vat and also to tax exemption in respect of charitable donations <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill has on the whole gone through very smoothly and i should like to thank the minister and the officials of the department of the environment who have all been extremely helpful <e> <s> the main point with which i was concerned was the length of lease to the courtauld institute through london university <e> <s> the answer given by the minister in committee that years is in mind col of <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not use the word appropriate at all <e> <s> i used the word reasonable <e> <s> not once did i use the word appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his very clear exposition of the bill <e> <s> the noble lord has saved me the trouble and time of having to go through it clause by clause <e> <s> after all we have been here before because the bill was going through this house when the general election was called <e> <s> i am also very conscious of the number of speakers who have their names down to speak today and i look forward to hearing the maiden speech of the noble lord lord broxbourne who will be speaking very soon <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to intervene if it is a convenient moment for the minister though he seems to be in full flight <e> <s> what we are discussing this evening and he should concentrate his mind on it is the right to buy houses that have been designed for the elderly and the disabled <e> <s> it is no good the noble lord going back on all the old stuff and trying to tart it up in a general way <e> <s> that will not do either <e> <s> will the noble lord answer the points on what i have just mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked the noble lord in relation to that matter the question was also asked by the noble lord lord hylton and also i think by someone else how this is going to be paid for <e> <s> will more funds be given to the housing associations <e> <s> can we be told when we shall see the amendments <e> <s> will we have prior notice of them <e> <s> this is of interest to everyone who has spoken <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down can he say whether we shall have notes on clauses <e> <s> he is always very helpful on such matters <e> <s> also when will the amendment on charitable housing associations be ready <e> <s> because i do not think it would be fair if it were to be bounced on this house just before the committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister agree with my noble friend that this really is a minimal crumb to come before us today <e> <s> during the statement the noble lord said that by concentrating it in this way it will help local authorities with their administrative problems <e> <s> how by dealing in this rather stingy mingy way with tapers by increasing from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> in april then from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> in november is this going to help any administrative problems <e> <s> it is probably going to cost even more than it gets in by trying to deal with the matter in these two bites at the one cherry <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank my noble friend lady lockwood for initiating this debate <e> <s> the report before us today widens from a political football to an academic study the terms of reference of the current debate on the governments decision to abolish metropolitan authorities <e> <s> as my noble friend explained it compares the british system of local government with the systems in other western democracies <e> <s> one must begin where the author begins and acknowledge that he has indeed provided only a starting point for a vast and complex subject <e> <s> but i believe it is a starting point distinguished by its objectivity its care and professionalism <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we have a minimum number this evening and so i do not think that one can read too much into that but i take the noble lords point <e> <s> i was not sure whether he was looking at the matter on a larger scale <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister will give way have the government yet started costing this <e> <s> will it be costed and will we know the costing at some time <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord does not have the answers tonight but as he raised the point i wonder whether he can give some indication <e>", "<cs> i was interested to hear what the minister would say on this amendment and he has certainly said it <e> <s> he talked first about perpetuating a sense of injustice and i agree that there is some truth in that <e> <s> there is a certain amount of discrimination but that is brought about because of the law of supply and demand <e> <s> if there were enough dwellings for the disabled either purpose-built or adapted there would not be any question of having a right to buy <e> <s> this is not a question of whether or not one should have a right to buy <e>", "<cs> may i thank the minister very much for his explanation of this clause <e> <s> it is clear in the drafting but it was not quite clear what was meant by it <e> <s> i agree with what he said at the beginning <e> <s> my noble friends and i should like the opportunity to read what he has said and if we have any points that we want to raise such as on the common room to come back on report <e>", "<cs> i listened very carefully to what the minister said against the awful odds that he faced from all sides of the committee <e> <s> it was rather unfair of him to refer only to noble lords opposite him <e> <s> there were as many noble lords behind him who spoke up strongly for the amendment as there were on this side <e> <s> his offer is a sincere one <e> <s> nevertheless it does not deal with the core of the matter <e> <s> what all those who have spoken have been concerned about is the basic question that elderly people pensioners in this category which has been very tightly drawn whose houses have always been let to pensioners and are specially designed and adapted should be exempted from the right to buy <e> <s> what the minister may be coming forward with is only a sincere straw which he has clutched at and it will not deal with the basic problem <e> <s> therefore i am sorry to say this because the noble lord is making an effort as this is a central matter of principle i must ask the committee to express its opinion <e>", "<cs> i should like to explain that my noble friend lady fisher asked me to convey her apologies as she had to catch a train <e> <s> she was not simply leaving the chamber for no good reason <e>", "<cs> i was rather relieved to find that other noble lords are also slightly mystified about this and it has raised a number of queries <e> <s> my noble friend lord northfield has raised this matter but i was also about to query what reasonable means <e> <s> there seems to be a lack of understanding about this new clause and to the best of my knowledge i do not think we have a note on it <e> <s> noble lords opposite have the answer do they <e>", "<cs> i was about to suggest to the minister that in order to help both him and this side of the committee we delay further discussion until the report stage and perhaps it would be possible for us all to have not just a copy of the letter which he intends to write to my noble friend but an explanation of exactly what this means because it is rather complicated language <e> <s> a number of comments have been make about it and i have ringed the word reasonable <e> <s> i am still not sure that the points made by the noble lord lord monson have been adequately answered <e> <s> however i doubt whether we could sort this out at this time of night across the table <e>", "<cs> we certainly agree with this amendment because so far as i can gather it is a clarification point and anything that clarifies something in this bill must be a good thing <e>", "<cs> i think we now come to a rather difficult point because with the passing of the amendment on clause looking hard at clause i am doubtful whether it now has any life at all <e> <s> either it has been completely wiped out or there are only some peripheral edges to it <e> <s> i did not interrupt when the minister moved the three amendments to it because they seemed to be completely semantic and it did not matter one way or the other but when we get to the substance of the clause taking it in conjunction with the amendment passed earlier it seems to me certainly at first and second glance to be enveloped by what happened earlier today <e> <s> i do not know whether any of us has had a chance to go into it in great detail but it does not seem to be something that we can discuss with great knowledge now <e> <s> it appears that substantially there is not much left <e> <s> if as we have done we are making a group of housing exempt from the right to buy the whole pre-emption clause goes <e> <s> it cannot possibly apply <e>", "<cs> i just want to make it clear and have it recorded that what happened this afternoon was that <e>", "<cs> i certainly do not intend either to press the amendment or to lengthen the debate much tonight <e> <s> i am very sorry that when we began discussing this amendment the noble and learned lord was not in his place <e> <s> i am not sure whether he would have supported me or the government but he certainly would have said something useful in clarifying this particular point <e>", "<cs> i am sure it is defective <e> <s> practically everything is <e> <s> why should this be different <e> <s> it is getting rather late and we are tired anyhow <e> <s> i will read what the minister has said <e> <s> but it does certainly seem to make a certain amount of sense when there is shared ownership for the authority to have the first option to buy it back and then it would have the complete house <e> <s> if it wants to sell it as a complete unit or in the meantime let it again it has the property <e> <s> the minister explained the matter very carefully but i am afraid that perhaps i did not take it in as carefully as i should have done so unless he has something to add i will read what he has said <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this is quite a mouthful and an earful to take in so late at night <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that <e> <s> as this was an amendment put in after the notes on clauses came out we have not had any note on this schedule <e> <s> therefore it has been a case of trying to go through everything in the bill and not always quite keeping up with it <e> <s> it would be extremely helpful and we could have a more productive discussion on report since there are one or two points that i want to raise if the minister could let me and anybody else who is concerned and who would like it as well have an explanatory note <e> <s> it is not that it is so difficult to follow the grounds are simple to understand <e> <s> we want to know the general thinking behind all that relates to mobility which obviously we support but there are some points which i shall have to take up with the minister <e> <s> it would also save time if at report we had a better idea of what we are discussing <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for the answer he has just read to us <e> <s> we on these benches echo what his honourable friend feels about the assault on the reputation of this country as well as on that of football when events such as this take place <e> <s> unfortunately it does not come as such a surprise as one would have hoped because this has happened in the past two years not only in luxembourg but also in denmark holland italy and switzerland <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord harris of greenwich has asked a completely hypothetical question what i would call in more informal language an ify question <e> <s> i cannot believe that as he put it public interest requires an answer to such a hypothetical question <e> <s> i do not think that it is the governments job and i hope the minister will agree to answer questions of this hypothetical nature <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> he is right because it is not unique but it is also not on any of the governments hit lists of high spenders <e> <s> the council is locally elected and is locally accountable <e> <s> at the present time a constant debate is taking place in the council <e> <s> it is going on between members of the council between the councils employees between the council and the government and as the noble lord pointed out nupe and the nut have dissociated themselves from any illegal action <e>", "<cs> my lords no i shall not i am just coming to the end of my speech <e> <s> it is no good the noble lord laughing about this he knows as well as i do that this sort of thing and this type of publicity only acts as an incentive to those people who probably take a very much more extreme view than many other people <e> <s> confrontation does not produce conciliation and hypothetical questions are dangerous and irresponsible <e> <s> i am very sorry that someone who was once a member of my party should table such a hypothetical question <e> <s> i am not talking about his political views now for everyone has the right to change but i am talking about his sense of timing and if i may say so his common sense in doing something like this <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord sandford replies may i just make one brief comment <e> <s> i thought that the ministers explanation was extremely clear <e> <s> he made out a well-balanced case but it seems to me that there is one practical point about this <e> <s> there could be a certain amount of doubt or argument about the date of notification <e> <s> the authority may correctly have down one date the person concerned may have made a mistake and believe that it is another date <e> <s> the date of death is definite <e> <s> when the minister is considering this matter perhaps he ought to take that into consideration <e>", "<cs> there is one brief point that i wish to make <e> <s> i am sure the minister will remember we considered this ground last year and i think his noble friend lord skelmersdale replied then <e> <s> at the report stage in another place the minister said that this was of course under consideration <e> <s> i take very much what the noble and learned lord has said but this does seem to have been going on a tremendous amount of time and the examples of hardship have unfortunately increased rather than diminished <e> <s> we and those <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord sandford responds to the ministers comments i should like to point out that we find ourselves at one with the minister as regards this particular amendment <e> <s> there is another point to bear in mind <e> <s> the noble lord lord sandford was concerned about the question of overcrowding or what was happening to sheltered accommodation <e> <s> however paragraph says that sheltered accommodation is somewhere where there are social services or special facilities provided in close proximity to a group of dwelling-houses <e> <s> therefore i should have thought that what goes on in sheltered housing and the number of people living there can be far more easily found out than similar information relating to almost any other type of housing <e>", "<cs> we on these benches welcome this amendment and think that it is an improvement on what has been the rather loosely worded section of the act <e> <s> it makes the situation clear and it is also much more equitable <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may interrupt the minister <e> <s> i think that we all go along very much with what the noble and learned lord lord simon said <e> <s> my noble friend lord graham asked the minister whether he would take the amendments separately <e> <s> my noble friend lady fisher indicated to me earlier that she wanted to raise a point on this amendment <e> <s> if the amendments are to be taken together though we are having explanations but then running on it will be difficult to discuss points on the different amendments and everything becomes very complicated <e> <s> i should be grateful if the minister could stop there and if we could deal with these tenancies before he goes on to the next amendment in the group <e> <s> otherwise we shall be back to where we were before my noble friend lord graham asked for the amendments to be dealt with separately <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the ministers point <e> <s> but the list of groupings for the amendments came round very late in the morning and i had to attend another engagement before i came here <e> <s> therefore it was impossible to go through the list to the extent that it should have been gone through in order to decide to agree to it <e> <s> the noble and learned lord raised this question which was worrying a <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may follow up the very substantial points made by the noble and learned lord and say that i think he put his finger on why we have this problem at the beginning of the report stage <e> <s> i was in any case going to draw attention to it when i moved the next amendment <e> <s> on this side and i am sure the minister thinks the same we do not like to start a stage of a bill with a feeling of any animosity or tension between the benches <e> <s> it is quite <e>", "<cs> my lords may i help the minister and say that as i understand it there was a keeling amendment of this sort used in this house on the health bill and we tried to do the same thing on the national heritage bill which was another piece of legislation by reference in order to simplify matters <e> <s> perhaps the minister could go on from there and he might find that useful <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise only to <e>", "<cs> my lords i was so hasty because i wanted to congratulate the minister on the way that he explained the amendment <e> <s> i feel that if it had been put to music both the original and the replacement with the music written by andrew lloyd webber he would have a hit on his hands <e>", "<cs> my lords it is to remove subsection of clause <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has dealt passionately with this issue <e> <s> there really is no use in his bringing up this old chestnut all the time about the right-to-buy issue and the attitude on this side of the house <e> <s> we are discussing an amendment which increases the maximum rate of discount from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> i intend to restrict my remarks to that amendment <e> <s> the minister said there was a contradiction in what i said that on the one hand there would be people who would make profits from it and on the other there would be people who would undertake commitments that they could not afford <e> <s> these are two different sets of people <e> <s> the same thing can be happening to entirely different people <e> <s> we are not talking about the same people doing the same thing <e> <s> but the noble lord knows that <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that as i read it i did not understand it <e>", "<cs> my lords there is one question that i am not clear about <e> <s> obviously no one would go against the example that the minister gave <e> <s> but are there controls or constraints <e> <s> is there wholesale removal of the requirement to pay back discount if land is sold in under five years <e> <s> if that is a general concession it seems to me a rather dangerous one <e> <s> how is it restricted so that it only extends to the type of example that the minister gave <e> <s> that is what concerns me <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale and the noble lord lord molson for expressing a view on this extremely difficult subject <e> <s> as my noble friend lord graham of edmonton has just said we are concerned that what has been decided quite clearly in this house should not be entirely overridden by another place <e> <s> on a different occasion and upon a different bill the noble viscount lord whitelaw said that what we in this house thought was right we should do irrespective of what will happen in another place <e> <s> therefore i feel very strongly that it would be very unfortunate if by standing back from it anything we did here helped to slide away what we have achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord lord simon is absolutely right the point i was going to raise was on subsection <e> <s> subsection is far too esoteric for me <e> <s> i did not come to grips with it at all <e> <s> therefore i would be grateful if the minister would reply on it <e>", "<cs> my lords i understood the minister was going to take the whole clause back and look at it not to move the amendment <e> <s> that was our understanding <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a very real problem which the noble and learned lord has drawn to our attention <e> <s> that is why i think we have got off to a slightly bad start <e> <s> we have this very difficult grouping of amendments which are so complicated <e> <s> as i pointed out they are very difficult for us who are not lawyers and who have no department to help us with them <e> <s> there are two very important subsections in the new clause and there is the point raised by the noble earl lord selkirk on the necessity for the whole clause <e> <s> if as the minister said he is quite willing to accept either method of handling this problem my noble friends and myself would be happier if at this stage he withdrew the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am sorry that the minister has taken this matter so much to heart as to describe as mean and vindictive what i thought was a reasonable point of view which illustrated differences of opinion which even this afternoon have been echoed across the house <e> <s> there was nothing mean or vindictive in what i said <e> <s> i was taking the clause as it stood and arguing against it <e> <s> the minister said that what we are proposing was totally different from the amendment which was so resoundingly won last year <e> <s> it is not totally different it is simply trying to find a different way to deal with the same people <e> <s> it is a matter on which many doubts have been raised even this afternoon <e> <s> the noble lord lord moyne said that the government are putting in an extra million <e> <s> once again i must repeat that any extra money made available to the housing corporation or a housing association will come off the housing programme which has been reduced <e> <s> this is one of the important points <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there is widespread concern in the country that inadequate attention is being paid to the integration of environmental policy with agriculture policy and can he give us some information on what steps are being taken by the government to improve this <e> <s> is he further aware that as it now stands the act is of no <e>", "<cs> no i was not <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the reply may i say right away that i of course accept the apology from the minister <e> <s> he is quite right it does not very often happen and anybody can slip up but it has made things difficult <e> <s> one of the things it did i am afraid was not to give me sufficient time to be able to frame an amendment on subsection which was the other very strong point made on report i thought by the noble and learned lord lord simon and repeated today <e> <s> it was really the point to get something in by way of an amendment in order to raise the whole matter <e> <s> i do not think that the reply is entirely satisfactory <e> <s> i also agree with the noble and learned lord lord simon that there should be an opportunity for the other place to have a look at this and therefore i intend to press the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> the noble earl lord selkirk put his finger right on the point that i had been making like other noble lords throughout the discussion <e> <s> it is not so much that the money comes out of the housing corporation funds althought that is an important matter the corporation has itself said that it cannot meet future obligations <e> <s> however even if more is put into the housing corporation funds it will still have to come out of housing funds generally where there has been a reduction <e> <s> there is no projected increase in the public expenditure figures for housing <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should just like to support the noble lord lord monson in his amendment <e> <s> he stated it very clearly and made out an extremely good case <e> <s> i think that many people on both sides of the house would feel much happier about the whole scheme if the government felt that they could accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank the minister for his courtesy also for his kind references to my colleagues on the front bench and to myself and also to my noble friend lady denington <e> <s> i cannot thank him for his support for any of the amendments which we were trying to get passed <e> <s> i feel rather sad for him because of his notable lack of enthusiasm and i felt there was unease even from his own benches <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the amendment standing in my name on the order paper <e> <s> the amendment reads at the end of the motion to insert <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me nearly eight hours since i moved this amendment <e> <s> i only hope noble lords will have a very good recollection of it because i fear with great respect that the minister seems to have forgotten some of it or rather got it wrong <e>", "<cs> i think it is lord underhills turn <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that this is a difficult situation <e> <s> i moved an amendment which was reasonable in substance and i think reasonable in the way that it was moved and kept it quite apart from the bill with which it is connected <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord thorneycroft was not in his place when i moved the amendment <e> <s> may i repeat for other noble lords and for the noble lord lord thorneycroft that during second reading noble lords and these included himself referred to the problems and anxieties about local government finance and the rating system at this time <e>", "<cs> i had thought about it <e> <s> the government are then in a position if this is lost to bring forward something themselves <e> <s> the government can then put up their own amendment <e> <s> they obviously do not like this one anyway <e> <s> or any noble lord can come forward with a different amendment <e> <s> what i want to test is the feeling for the principle because however people vote the feelings that have been expressed during this debate have really been such as to ask the government to take some action and to show that they are going to take some action <e> <s> if the government do not do so they are going right in the face of the committee and are depending on the vote of people who have not heard the debate at all <e>", "<cs> i think that in this whole bill we are dealing with territory which is comparatively new in many respects and also highly dangerous <e> <s> at least that is what many of us feel <e> <s> i think that the minister acknowledged that there will be a lot of concern on behalf of the authorities themselves <e> <s> i feel that the main point about this is that the executive will take over the functions of parliament <e> <s> we all know that this is not a practicality <e> <s> no secretary of state can sit down and read every word in every report about every individual authority <e> <s> this has to be done by departmental officials who no doubt do their best but are very busy and often with very heavily-loaded jobs <e> <s> we are supporting this series of amendments because we want every check and balance that we can have when dealing with this <e> <s> the minister should keep in mind that this is very difficult territory <e> <s> whatever ones party political views are it is still something which affects the whole of our democracy and the concern between central and local government <e> <s> i am not concerned at this moment whether it is a labour authority a conservative authority or a liberal authority <e> <s> i do not think that this is the point at issue <e> <s> the point is that the authority should have the opportunity of explaining what it is doing <e> <s> this is why packaging it up in one report seems to me to be highly dangerous <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is a very simple soul <e> <s> he can say that again <e> <s> while there are two houses of parliament and while there is a house of lords then it must play its part in the working of our parliamentary duties and as part of our constitution <e> <s> that is the situation now that is what we are dealing with and that is what we should concentrate on <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will accept this as entirely confidential between himself and myself i would say that i do not think the party is per cent <e> <s> in favour of the abolition of the house of lords any more than his party is per cent <e> <s> in favour of a great many proposals they had in their manifesto <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt but i would like some guidance <e> <s> i thought that we had got to the point where the noble lord lord evans of claughton had said that he was going to divide the house on this amendment <e> <s> how much longer the debate now taking place will go on after that i do not know but i would have thought with great respect that it is out of order now <e> <s> he has indicated his wish and the question should have been put there <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the amendment in the name of the noble baroness lady stedman <e> <s> although the noble lord lord broxboume may be right on some of the points he has made as far as the wording of the amendment is concerned i do not like legislation by reference any more than he does <e> <s> we had a number of exchanges over that in which the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale took part on the housing bill <e> <s> nevertheless i think the aim of this amendment is of extreme importance <e> <s> following this amendment we have a series of amendments dealing with rather more specific disregards covering voluntary organisations and statutory duties health and so on <e> <s> further on there is one in the name of the noble viscount lord ridley on law and order on the police <e> <s> this amendment which sets the whole series up is of very great importance <e>", "<cs> if for no other reason although there are reasons i rise to support the amendment so that the noble viscount does not feel totally deserted <e> <s> in the final analysis he is absolutely right that law and order must be a national responsibility <e> <s> in spite of there being local police powers of which we are all well aware law and order is nationally defined <e> <s> as a priority of the present government i should have thought that this is one area where the government would accept an amendment <e> <s> the amendment is entirely different as the noble viscount explained from the other amendments which we have discussed and which unfortunately received rather a shabby reception from the government <e>", "<cs> i rise to support amendments nos <e> <s> and which have just been spoken to and i should like also to speak to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> the ministers reply makes me even more worried than i was when i moved the amendment <e> <s> the amendment says <e>", "<cs> i have sat down <e>", "<cs> i really must answer that intervention by the minister and of course i was quite happy for him to make it <e> <s> i asked whether if he objected to the per cent <e> <s> and felt that that was too high he would be prepared to come back with another figure <e> <s> hearing the murmurings around me it seemed both to me and my noble friends that the way he was arguing was very much on the selective scheme rather than on the general powers and it is the general powers i am talking about <e> <s> since i find the reason given totally unsatisfactory and very worrying i intend to press this amendment to a division <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the amendment to which i have my name and on which the noble baroness lady stedman <e> <s> and the noble lord lord chelwood have both made such powerful speeches <e> <s> we have spent two long days discussing the details of the so-called selective rate limitation scheme <e> <s> during that time we have failed to persuade noble lords opposite to assist in ameliorating the provisions of that part of the bill <e> <s> therefore we are left with a selective scheme of rate limitation which can become as wide as the secretary of state wishes <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e> <s> on the question of local accountability it must make a difference if the council has to come before the electorate more often and if it has been acting in some way that is considered extravagant <e> <s> this is something that has been advocated by a great many people including academics and other people in this field as well as politicians <e> <s> on the noble lords second point the whole question of rates and local government finance is something at which the government have been urged to look <e> <s> i will not delay the proceedings further by commenting on the implications of what the noble lord was saying otherwise because we may get to the stage where he will be arguing that if people are not paying taxes perhaps they ought not to have the right to vote anyhow <e>", "<cs> the minister i think appreciates as he mentioned that this proposal came in very late in the day and it has been extremely difficult to take in all the complexities of this amendment <e> <s> frankly it really makes me feel that had the government decided more wisely than the votes indicated here not to go ahead with the general powers at all <e> <s> we would at least have been spared all this stuff with which we are now faced in order to make the situation more flexible <e> <s> it really is a kind of alice in wonderland situation to have to deal with all this incomprehensible stuff in order to reassure people who need not have had to be reassured if the government had not done what they did in the first place <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness who moved this amendment explained it so clearly that there is not really much to add <e> <s> we from these benches support the amendment for the reasons that the noble baroness set out <e> <s> a rate cap according to what was said in another place by sir george young would have a grea a target and an expenditure limit determined in accordance with this bill <e> <s> we feel also that there will be a great deal of confusion and inequity in this situation <e>", "<cs> after hearing what he said i wonder whether it occurred to the noble lord lord mottistone and the noble lord lord broxbourne and the noble lord lord pennock in view of the other amendments that are going to come before us that they might suggest to their noble friend the minister that he sets up an inquiry into the rating system both industrial and domestic <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may ask the minister a couple of questions <e> <s> obviously account-ability is blurred by precepting <e> <s> i understand the point about bringing information from precepting authorities to ratepayers directly <e> <s> will this be done at the expense of the precepting authority or will the government make money available <e> <s> there will be an additional amount of expenditure involved <e> <s> at first glance although i have not had much chance to look at it <e> <s> it seems that this could be quite an expensive operation <e> <s> will it also be the case that the home secretary and the secretary of state for transport provide the information for the metropolitan police and the london regional transport precepts <e> <s> will parishes be covered by the amendment <e> <s> they are formally precepting authorities are they not <e>", "<cs> my lords as i had my name to that amendment perhaps i might add a few words to those of the noble lord lord molson and say how delighted we are on these benches that this amendment was largely accepted with some minor alterations by another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to reply to the debate <e> <s> we are very grateful to all those noble lords from all sides of the house who have spoken so strongly in favour of this amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord molson had some doubts about it and wanted reassurance on the rural side <e> <s> i do not think that he got the reassurance that he wanted but as someone who takes an interest in the welfare of the elderly and who is himself a very kindly man i put it to him that he should also look at the plight of the elderly in the urban areas in the towns and cities for it is the whole area with which this amendment is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that since national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty are designed to protect the open countryside it follows that scarcely any housing is to be found in those places <e> <s> does he not agree that this cuts down the amount of housing available in rural areas <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the costs of keeping people in bed and breakfast accommodation are far higher than the revenue cost of building new homes which is really the only economic and humane way of reducing the enormous number of homeless people <e>", "<cs> my lords i had intended to speak immediately after the noble lord lord sandford and support his amendment and that would have been at slightly more length than i shall now speak <e> <s> but wisely i waited to hear what the minister had to say and since he is taking it back he has the support of my noble friends and myself <e>", "<cs> my lords this is quite a complicated and very worrying amendment <e> <s> the first point i must make is that it is very late in the day for the government to have put down amendments of this nature to a bill which has only clauses <e> <s> we saw it for the first time only yesterday and its report stage is today <e> <s> it is really very difficult to deal with it at such short notice <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave i should like to welcome the ministers statement that if he considers <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him a question <e> <s> the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley quite rightly agreed that inflation can go down as well as go up <e> <s> in that situation there is even less reason it seems to me not to accept the amendment because as the noble lord has agreed it works both ways <e> <s> the amendment does not refer only to a rise in the rate of inflation <e> <s> it would deal with a situation where the rate of inflation went either down or up <e> <s> i should have thought that the minister ought to consider having another look at this for it is a small harmless but very practical amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister will allow me to intervene i did not mean on the constituent parts of the order <e> <s> every report would be the subject of one particular order <e>", "<cs> my lords i really do not find that the ministers reply has been satisfactory at all <e> <s> he compares rate capping to a discussion on the rate support grant <e> <s> they are not at all the same thing <e> <s> the rate support grant is something that the government decide they will do out of their own public expenditure and from the way that they see things <e> <s> rate-capping is a strongly penal process which we have not seen before <e> <s> that is why i am moving the amendment <e> <s> it is even more important that on this the government should be seen to be bending over to give the widest possible opportunity for each authoritys report to be discussed individually <e> <s> it is surely important not only that members of parliament should feel that but that the individual authority should again feel that it has had a fair hearing <e> <s> it cannot if there is to be this cluster of authorities <e> <s> we do not even know how many there will be <e> <s> a later amendment mentions the figure but we do not know <e> <s> we have not been told <e> <s> the government do not know <e> <s> i do not think they are hiding a figure from us <e> <s> but as that is the case each authority should be dealt with individually <e>", "<cs> my lords it is quite extraordinary that we were told all the time on the discussion of part <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble viscount replies i fear that i must intervene <e> <s> if it were not so serious this bill would be absolutely hilarious <e> <s> it is incomprehensible <e> <s> as my noble and learned friend observed it is full of gobbledegook <e> <s> the drafting is absolutely appalling <e> <s> its intentions are not known <e> <s> the motivations are all mixed up <e> <s> we see this all the way through the bill <e> <s> the minister is doing the best that he can with honestly almost the worst possible piece of legislation that he could have had thrust on him <e> <s> in that way i feel very sorry for him about it all <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley for his stalwart support <e> <s> he is quite right as my noble friend lord graham of edmonton was when he moved amendment no <e> <s> earlier this afternoon <e> <s> since principles in this bill are such a movable feast i do not see why the minister should be so exercised about whether one set is referred to in one lot or in different lots <e> <s> as the noble lord lord beaumont pointed out there is little point in pressing this to a division tonight and we shall have to find another way of approaching it perhaps in the last stages of the bill <e> <s> nevertheless the only way we can get any solace from all this is that when the government find unfortunately that they get into the muddle which we have all foreseen they will have on record the much stronger straws at which they can clutch than those with which they are building the bill at the moment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may well say hear hear <e> <s> i am sorry for all those who work in that building and who also have to look at it <e> <s> the government will try again to liquidate their way out of the chaos <e> <s> i would guess that in about months time we shall see again further local government legislation <e> <s> but this need not be the case <e> <s> why do the government not say now that enough is enough <e> <s> they now have their manifesto commitment to protect the ratepayers <e> <s> though one must ask at what cost in terms of the damage to local democracy <e> <s> one must also ask whether when it comes out in the wash it will in fact protect the ratepayers <e>", "<cs> i listened with great interest to what the noble lord lord henderson of brompton said and i shall want to give it some thought <e> <s> i am grateful to him for his suggestion <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that absolutely fascinating and very detailed <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to oppose the amendment but it is more cosmetic than substantial <e> <s> given the choice i would have preferred the words desirability of preserving public access <e> <s> on my reading of it desirability is more positive and would also allow for the hazards which the minister has pointed out <e> <s> nobody would think in those circumstances that access had to be given <e> <s> this has been precedented in other places and other acts <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord the minister has mistaken the bill which we are supposed to be discussing today <e> <s> we are not discussing the bill for the abolition of the glc <e> <s> we are discussing the local government interim provisions bill <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister if he would be so kind could possibly address himself to that bill as we are most anxious to hear the governments case on it <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill before us today was finally described by the minister when he got round to it as important but for those who care about <e>", "<cs> my lords i am rather worried about one of the comments made by the minister <e> <s> the second amendment refers to <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i heard and understood what the minister said <e> <s> it seems to me that it is a very dangerous precedent which is probably occurring more and more <e> <s> the fact that there is a tremendous government majority in the commons which takes all this for granted is rather disturbing <e> <s> the minister explained it and i am not blaming him for it but i think it is a worry that it should be so <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i found the ministers reply very unsatisfactory <e> <s> to say that this is clear and unambiguous i thought was really using way out language to describe any part of this bill and certainly these amendments <e> <s> when they were moved on report and i saw them on the order paper <e> <s> i was extremely concerned about them <e> <s> when the minister said he had looked at them <e> <s> i hoped as i said earlier although without much hope that he might do something about them but he has not <e> <s> as i said before what this has done is shackled authorities with an ever tighter noose <e> <s> therefore i shall do what in order to enable the minister to have another chance i did not do on report i will press this to a division <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not really very much comfort to know that the noble lord and his noble friend have discussed this and considered it with great care <e> <s> when replying the noble lord said that i and my supporters recognised that to have a report for each authority was not satisfactory <e> <s> that is absolutely not true <e> <s> i will reiterate that we consider that that is by far the best most important and safest way to have parliamentary scrutiny <e> <s> that was entirely supported by the very large vote and the very near miss when we put this to a division on report <e> <s> the only reason i have not put it hack is partly the convention that one does not put down exactly the same amendment when it has been voted on at a previous stage and partly because it is clear from the size of the house at the moment that i should not win it if i did so <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendments moved by the noble lord lord henderson of brompton are an extremely ingenious way to deal with a problem that has been troubling us all <e> <s> he is quite right when he says that they are purely non-party amendments <e> <s> obviously what they seek to do is to improve parliamentary invigilation of the implementation of the general scheme of rate limitation <e> <s> the noble lord is absolutely right <e> <s> he explained the position thoroughly so it does not need very much more explanation from me or from anyone else <e>", "<cs> my lords following what the noble lord lord evans has just said i should also like to stress that this is an extremely moderate and mild amendment which has been very moderately moved by the noble lord lord sandford and my noble friend lord northfield <e> <s> personally i prefer the amendment in the names of myself and my noble friends that i moved on report which covered a time limit for both parts of the bill because i think there is a strong argument for part i also having a time limit just to see how it works out especially as we have been unable to get from the government any idea of the numbers that they consider will be among those in the first part of the selective scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am sorry but it does not seem to us that this has anything to do with the amendment that is before us <e> <s> the amendment that is before us is a time limitation on part ii of the bill <e> <s> it is not to do with the selective scheme or rate capping generally <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late stage today it has certainly seemed as though we were spending all day on rate capping and indeed i think we were i should like to thank the noble lord the minister for his cheerfulness and courtesy and even his long suffering when i tried this time it was on only one occasion helpfully to keep him to his point <e> <s> i thought i was helping him and enabling him to undress what he was trying to save from the clothing that had been supplied no doubt by the department i am sure not by himself <e> <s> i am also very grateful for the help of the front bench team over here and for the help of other noble lords who have supported us in our opposition to the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords in spite of what various governments have done or have not done about vat relief on listed and other ancient buildings is the minister aware that the definition substantially reconstructing involves a great deal of gutting and demolition and the changing out of all character of so many of our buildings <e> <s> could the minister undertake to give further consideration in the coming year to the whole question of a newer definition and greater incentive in order to conserve and preserve buildings and also make them economically viable for other alternative uses <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the minister for the very clear and if i may say so the very charming and courteous way in which he put forward the changes which have been made in this part of the bill <e> <s> as the minister has pointed out when the bill arrived first in this house from another place all except sheltered housing was open for sale <e> <s> the provisions have been taken out subject to the old clause which covered the -year pre-emption buy-back which was discretionary anyway <e>", "<cs> what this amendment seeks to ensure is that the provisions of the paving bill including those dealing with the staff commissions and the provisions of clauses to cease if the main bill is not passed this is the core of the amendment and that the <e>", "<cs> on amendments nos <e> <s> and i think that the noble lord lord monson is right

did not and as we did not know what effect the amendment that has now been passed would have on it it made our task difficult <e> <s> having said that we now withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> if it is necessary when we have all had a chance to go into this matter we will come back with both amendments at report <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i say in answer to what the noble viscount the leader of the house has said that he is absolutely right and it is not what we thought at all <e> <s> but it means that there are certain amendments which are linked to that particular one <e> <s> i was anxious not having had a chance to go through the amendment to make sure that we were not wasting the time of the committee and going off on the wrong limb by moving amendments which had been overtaken by that <e> <s> i do not consider that amendments nos <e> <s> and a have been overtaken <e> <s> i was in the middle of moving no <e> <s> which is the same as that of the noble earl lord halsbury <e> <s> as i was going to say before amendment no i was slightly upset and felt rather distressed that the minister had not accepted my amendment which <e> <s> in fact was first on the list but took the amendment of the noble earl lord halsbury from the cross-benches <e> <s> that is a very small point but in substance it is exactly the same amendment <e> <s> there is the slight difference of an added word in the drafting <e>", "<cs> i shall be very happy to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> because the substance is the same as amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> i should like to know from the minister why he chose the amendment of the noble earl over mine <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord lord diamond made some points of great importance to this chamber <e> <s> it seems to me that we all ought to have the chance to have a look at what has been said and to think about it <e> <s> it is impossible to divorce any amendment of this type from the amendment which was passed originally <e> <s> it is also true that whatever the minister with great respect might say the noble earl himself in the debate on amendment no <e> <s> put this forward as an alternative <e> <s> earlier i was going to interrupt and say that this was really not the same sort of option but other noble lords including i think <e>", "<cs> may i say right away that i do not for one moment think that the noble earl wanted and he has never done so for all the time i have known him to mislead anybody <e> <s> as he has said he and his noble friends put it down to smooth ruffled feathers <e>", "<cs> i appreciate what the chief whip has said and i am withdrawing amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> but perhaps in order to save time after the dinner recess the noble earl there were other interventions and he did not have a chance to answer the invitation made by myself which was followed-up by my noble friend lord mcintosh will like me withdraw his amendment instead of having a rushed discussion during the dinner time <e> <s> then if necessary it can be put down at the next stage <e> <s> with great respect i do not think that the noble earl has had a chance to say what he wants to do <e>", "<cs> i beg to withdraw amendment no but i still say that the noble earl has not had a chance to say whether at this stage he wants to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> let him speak now <e>", "<cs> i have withdrawn amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> may i thank the noble viscount for what he said <e> <s> when we adjourned the committee for the other business to be considered the debate on this amendment had reached a slightly frenetic stage <e> <s> if i may say so i think that he has given the right advice and i am delighted that the noble earl has accepted it <e> <s> nothing can he lost by delaying something and thinking about it again <e>", "<cs> this is in the context of a different situation to the whole bill <e> <s> nevertheless the new clause moved by the noble lord lord evans of claughton will ensure that should that situation arise the making of a precept could be delayed until after elections had taken place to enable the new councils to determine budgets that reflect the policies on which they have been elected <e> <s> we are in a new ball game here <e> <s> for that reason it is important that we should have this amendment <e> <s> the fact that as the minister said it might he flawed in drafting is not the point as he said himself <e> <s> as of this moment i do not feel convinced by his arguments against the substance of it <e>", "<cs> that seems to be an extraordinary contribution from the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls <e> <s> he cannot ignore what happened a couple of hours ago <e> <s> we have to deal with the bill as it is now <e> <s> the bill is now as amended and this is how we are dealing with it <e> <s> we are going on and trying to deal with the amendments that are not incompatible with what happened when amendment no <e> <s> i was passed <e> <s> this does not mean to say that we do not take that into account <e> <s> it would be absolutely ludicrous to expect us to assume that the amendment that was won by votes is just going to disappear <e> <s> we are dealing with the bill as amended <e>", "<cs> nothing of the sort was agreed <e> <s> what was agreed was that where there were amendments which had no relevance to the original amendment we would go ahead <e> <s> but even as regards <e>", "<cs> i find it very strange and somewhat amusing that this government appear to have forgotten about the city of london <e> <s> the city of london with its powerful interests and with the amount of money that it spends and which comes to it is extremely small so far as residents are concerned <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> i am not ignoring them but that happens in many other urban centres <e> <s> unless people are living there and have voting rights they are not considered to be residents and are not electors <e> <s> we all know that the number of electors is very small indeed <e> <s> some of my best friends are electors in the city of london <e> <s> they are only a small group but they wield very great power <e> <s> perhaps the explanation as the noble lord lord lloyd said is that the government have misunderstood their own bill because since the glc boundaries coincide exactly with the parliamentary constituencies of london as a unit the city of london with westminster south is represented by a single glc member <e> <s> the department must have been under the impression that this arrangement would he carried over into the interim arrangements under schedule but it was pointed out during the committee stage in another place that the effect of the bill would he that city electors would be represented by one of the westminster appointees much as under the present arrangement <e> <s> this arose because schedule is based on borough rather than parliamentary boundaries <e>", "<cs> i am very surprised that in the circumstances the minister moved this amendment because it was tabled before the change in the bill when the first amendment was passed this evening <e> <s> the minister talks as though the bill will be out of the lords by april or may at the latest but there is nothing to substantiate that at all <e> <s> there is a very great chance that the bill will still be going through parliament at the time <e>", "<cs> i am not at all happy with the ministers answer on this point <e> <s> as he has more or less said he has relied on guesswork because this has never happened <e> <s> he said that this was a new situation of which none of us had had experience <e> <s> in a new situation of which one has not had experience it is always much safer to underdo things rather than to overdo them <e> <s> the noble lord lord evans with his particularly large realm of experience in local government my noble friend lady fisher from the midlands and my noble friend lady lockwood from south yorkshire all said the same thing <e> <s> they all spoke from great experience <e>", "<cs> i hope that when the minister takes it back he will look at it all again and not necessarily accept this amendment but see that there is a big problem here which could be exacerbated and become a much bigger problem <e> <s> we have got to the stage where the noble lord says i think it will be all right and we are saying no it will not be all right <e> <s> there is a limit to how long one can go on like that <e> <s> in the circumstances in the hope that the minister will come back with something that is more realistic and practical for the metropolitan county councils i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think my noble friend made clear at the beginning of the debate that in any case this is meant to be a probing amendment so i do not think the minister need exercise too much passion on it <e> <s> i do not think that he has as yet answered the points put by my noble friend lord mcintosh about groups which would not be called or recognised as political parties groups of ratepayers or other groups of people who would not consider themselves politically minded <e>", "<cs> in answer to what the minister has said in the first place we do not know what is in the main bill nobody knows i do not think the government know i do not think the department knows i do not think anybody at all knows except that the government intend to bring forward a bill to abolish the glc and the metropolitan county councils <e> <s> that certainly is not good enough on something which is for us to discuss and on which we have to make a measured and serious decision <e> <s> this is certainly not contradictory it follows the line of the amendment that was passed last thursday and what it does is absolutely consistent and entirely logical <e> <s> it gets rid of the interim councils because the amendment that was passed certainly includes the taking place of elections unless the whole of the main bill gets through by april <e> <s> this seems absolutely incongruous and quite impossible <e> <s> therefore what this amendment does is to cover the time factor and it gets rid of the interim councils which were really considered as a great anathema by many noble lords in all parts of this chamber and certainly not only from these benches <e>", "<cs> i understand what the minister has said <e> <s> i am sure my noble friend did not mean that the noble lord the minister was himself holding out on us <e> <s> he did not mean that at all what he meant was that we are waiting for a response from the government this afternoon <e> <s> the minister has really said again as i said earlier in moving the amendment that we seem to be indulging in shadow boxing this afternoon <e> <s> he has made it quite clear and his position is absolutely understandable that there is not much of any great consequence that he can say on any of these amendments because they are all entirely tied up with the central core of the whole argument <e>", "<cs> as the chief whip has now come into this discussion can he answer one question <e> <s> is he saying that what was said on the world at one news programme today by brian curtois of the bbc is completely untrue <e> <s> is no statement to be made by the government tomorrow <e>", "<cs> the chief whip also said that there is no reason why we should not continue with this bill after the passing of the first amendment <e> <s> i put it to him very strongly and clearly that this bill is very different from a great many other pieces of legislation which are before us because they stand on their own <e> <s> this is known as a paving bill to the main legislation <e> <s> that first amendment has made a tremendous difference to this bill and also to the paving to the main legislation <e> <s> we have already found from the first amendment and indeed from the ministers replies to it that it will be even more difficult to continue than i had previously thought <e> <s> i was very doubtful about it <e> <s> there are a great many amendments that we are not moving and which we cannot move because of the connections not only with our amendment but with what the government are now to do <e> <s> the noble lord lord boothby was not incorrect he was quite right when he said that it will be a big waste of your lordships time if nothing else <e>", "<cs> on that very sound note i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the reply is unsatisfactory and shows clearly the difficulties under which the minister is having to work as well as the difficulties we are in when asking these questions he being unable to provide the answers <e> <s> i do not think that the noble lord is unwilling to provide the answers <e> <s> i cannot understand why all the way through we are told that the interim councillors will be there for months <e> <s> i mentioned in moving amendment a what the secretary of state had said in another place about it not being worth having elections for a few months <e> <s> the government seem to have made up their mind but on the other hand we have no information that there is any substantial infrastructure to these beliefs of theirs that they can in fact complete all this tremendous work which i am afraid i spelled out in some detail within the months <e>", "<cs> or cricket <e> <s> i should prefer to watch wimbledon rather than to discuss these amendments in the political contours in which we are discussing them today <e> <s> although it may be and probably will be necessary to return to this question on another occasion i now propose to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg the noble lords pardon <e> <s> i was going from the original amendment and it is true that i changed the drafting <e> <s> it is the later amendment to which i am speaking <e> <s> however what i said was applicable to both <e> <s> if not i will if i may right it <e> <s> i thank the noble lord and i apologise <e>", "<cs> the responses to <e>", "<cs> a great deal of excitement has been generated about something which seems to me to be perfectly normal <e> <s> i say right away that the drafting of the amendment could have been better <e> <s> what we are really discussing is the substance of it <e>", "<cs> it was not a success we thought we had it was a success we did have <e> <s> the figures are there <e> <s> this is not an imaginary success <e> <s> the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls very charmingly and engagingly keeps referring back to amendment no <e> <s> as though if he mentions amendment no <e> <s> enough it will just go away <e> <s> he had better realise that it will not go away <e>", "<cs> the noble lord said that much of this expenditure goes to supporting valuable activities and so on and that there was nothing to fear from it <e> <s> i am frankly quite appalled at this <e> <s> one may talk about using a sledgehammer to crack a nut but this is really the most appalling incursion in this bill <e> <s> first of all the question i should ask is this <e> <s> what is it doing in this bill anyhow <e> <s> the noble lord lord grimond at the beginning of the proceedings last thursday raised the point about the inclusion in the bill at this point and the long title being stretched like a piece of elastic in order to encompass it <e> <s> the minister in moving just now talked about the specific context of abolition and the obstruction by outgoing leadership <e> <s> he quoted for us as evidence the leader of the westminster council <e> <s> it was not evidence he was quoting at all he was quoting a letter of opinion <e> <s> lady porter is entitled to her opinion about this the same as everybody else but to call that evidence is nonsense in the same way as was the quote the noble lord gave from somebody who he said was concerned with labours campaign <e>", "<cs> the noble lord said that the ratepayers of london will suffer <e> <s> he also said that i missed the point <e> <s> i did not miss the point <e> <s> i was concerned about the control not about the right of local authorities to exercise their autonomy <e> <s> the noble <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister has raised a number of points and has answered a great many of our queries as well as he could and as courteously as usual <e> <s> but i do not think that any of us can feel reassured by what he said <e> <s> on the contrary in his opening remarks when he moved the clause he referred to the so-called enterprise board <e> <s> as nearly everybody who has spoken in the debate has mentioned the same phrase i do not think we misheard him <e> <s> the noble countess lady mar then spoke and the noble lord paid tribute to some of the boards and said how good they were <e> <s> but if i had been termed so-called i would not like to be an enterprise board or any other body asking for help or money <e> <s> i would consider that i had started under an extremely grave disadvantage <e>", "<cs> i do not propose at this stage to go into it <e> <s> it is a recent amendment and we are not happy about it <e> <s> it is much too wide and general and again has dangers <e> <s> but it is far too late to start arguing the toss about it now <e>", "<cs> my lords as i was involved in this bill may i also underline what my noble friends have said about the courtesy of the leader of the house in coming to the house and being extremely helpful <e> <s> but i should like to ask him a couple of questions <e> <s> the statement itself says into <e> <s> in answering questions the leader said that it was basically april <e> <s> is it not unlikely that the government will be able to complete this extraordinarily complex process of abolishing the metropolitan counties and the glc in what will be less than a year and if it goes on afterwards it could be as much as months when the same councillors will be <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble viscount will give way for one moment <e> <s> i understood that there had been a certain amount of discussion about grouping <e> <s> the later amendments which the noble viscount mentioned are not in the original groupings <e> <s> the original groupings cover amendments nos <e> <s> and and nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i really must protest <e> <s> i carefully did not refer to the later amendments but the leader of the house did <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount the leader of the house really has my admiration <e> <s> he has made a tremendously good job of what is fundamentally a very bad case for which he personally is not responsible <e> <s> he was extremely fair when he agreed that the other precedents that have been quoted were in the main in legislation which is the point which i and others have been making continually <e> <s> but he also said that because on this occasion there was not time the proposal had to be in this bill <e> <s> what we are being asked to do is to vote in a way that would be quite contrary not only to how we voted before by a large majority but also to the constitutional issues as they concern this house and to the whole concept of elections because the government did not have the time to bring forward their main bill and include all these proposals in it <e> <s> that really is not good enough <e> <s> with great respect we cannot be asked to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords it causes me some slightly hitter amusement that on the other amendment we were told all the time that of course everything will be sorted out and the bill will he through before the end of the session that it is possible that the following year everything will be done so there need not be elections <e> <s> now the minister is replying to this on the basis that in case the bill is not through we should not put in this date <e> <s> what we are concerned with is that whether it is this date or another date there should be something which does not let what will be a <e>", "<cs> my lords i was going to withdraw the amendment but hopefully would have heard a word from the minister <e> <s> this is the problem with report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords many of us have discussed from time to time the last time during the housing act the difficulty of following reference in the delegated legislation and the problems it involves <e> <s> it seems to me that to carry on with this and leaving out something which is perfectly clear where we know which act to turn to the local government act and inserting the principal act is a retrogressive step <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been an extraordinary and very depressing debate with the exception of the speeches of the noble baroness the leader of the liberal party and my noble friends behind me <e>", "<cs> it is perfectly true my lords <e> <s> quite frankly i was amazed that more noble lords who are concerned with various forms of charity with enterprise and industry did not speak up in a rather less prejudiced way <e> <s> they gave us the same stories which we have heard before from noble lords opposite <e> <s> it is true that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter who probably has the list in his mind and does not need to have it on a worn out piece of paper produces the same number of charities or other recipients of money every time <e>", "<cs> my lords i have heard that same list several times but the noble lord does not give the percentage that it comes to out of the very large total funds disbursed by the glc <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that this amendment is quite as simple as all that <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> my lords it is quite clear that once again we have come up against a brick wall <e> <s> my noble friend lord underhill was quite right but again we have had vague replies <e> <s> the government do not seem to have confidence in any body or in anything <e> <s> in any area of life or work there are people or organisations who sometimes do not come up to the standards which one would expect in every case but you do not then put an absolute blanket over everybody else which is exactly what the government are doing <e>", "<cs> my lords we now seem to have reached the height of government control and restriction <e> <s> these powers that we are now discussing are virtually unprecedented <e> <s> this is not something which has just been said by politicians but is something which is felt by students of local government and academics who are concerned with it and historians as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i must ask the minister about this amendment <e> <s> i cannot work out where it fits in and i am not sure whether there is a mistake and it should be inserted after the or or before <e> <s> can the minister tell us where it goes <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister know exactly where it goes <e> <s> on what line does it go <e> <s> the amendment reads incorrectly <e> <s> there is something the matter with it apart from its content <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for the support of the noble lord lord evans the noble viscount lord mountgarret and the noble lord lord monson <e> <s> it was particularly significant that what they were concerned with was what could arise as a result of this amendment not being included in the bill <e> <s> they did not discuss the substance of the bill itself except that the noble lord lord monson made it quite clear that he was in favour of the great substance of the bill but was very concerned about the question of the date <e> <s> i cannot agree with the minister that the amendment is not necessary <e> <s> i think it is absolutely necessary and that has been spelled out by other noble lords <e> <s> i shall not go over that again <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave i waited to see whether the minister wanted to come in again after the other speakers and as he did not i spoke <e> <s> as to what he has said this is the whole point <e> <s> it would not mean that at all <e> <s> if it fell it would fall anyhow <e> <s> then abolition would have to be reintroduced in the new session <e> <s> this is how the parliamentary system works if a bill falls by the end of a parliamentary session and that is absolutely correct <e> <s> i do not think there is anything more to be said about it so i shall proceed to divide the house <e>", "<cs> amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to the house <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> and go together and i should have said in moving it that no

made clear immediately that amendments nos <e> <s> and go together <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter once again generalises without giving any specific examples <e> <s> the jobs created by the glc and the metropolitan councils to which my noble friend lord graham referred he dismisses as being partly paid for by the ratepayers <e> <s> what the noble lord fails to see is the amount of work that is generated by these schemes both by the local authorities and by the local authorities in partnership with other bodies mentioned by the noble lord lord evans <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has probably completely forgotten about the enterprise zones where special arrangements are made and where payment of rates is excused <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to support the amendment standing in the name of the noble lord lord evans of claughton and myself <e> <s> it is true that we have been over this ground before but i do not think that we can let this third reading of the bill go through when the whole bill has missed almost a complete stage because of the mess we found ourselves in at the committee stage and because of the very large amendments tabled by the government to the bill throughout the bills proceedings <e>", "<cs> my lords without this amendment if we look at the beginning of clause it says <e>", "<cs> no my lords that is too late for the noble baroness she would rather have had it yesterday not today and when the noble baroness is talking about contracts and so on she does not seem to make any distinction between whether they may be good or bad schemes <e> <s> what she does not seem to realise is that everything comes to a complete halt and it does not only affect the authority or the government but it affects

<s> the noble lord lord ezra did it so admirably and covered all the ground so well that all i think i need say is that we on these benches who have our name to the amendment certainly support it absolutely and hope that we shall get some satisfaction from the government as indeed the noble lord asked <e>", "<cs> my lords the ministers reply was very unsatisfactory <e> <s> after all we did not put in this <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down and i assume that he has not i would point out that this was something that the government put into a temporary bill <e> <s> it should be looked at in that way and it is only applying to those authorities concerned in this matter <e> <s> this is not a political point <e> <s> it seems to me wrong on any ground to make those penalties so penal which they are in this bill <e> <s> it is not the right place <e> <s> if the government want anything else they should wait for the abolition bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i think with respect that it is the custom for the front benches to speak first <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank the minister for repeating the statement made in another place by his right honourable friend <e> <s> this is a landmark in the history of local government <e> <s> it is the first time in years of rating history that a secretary of state has possessed powers of this kind <e> <s> this marks the beginning of a disastrous future for the hit list authorities and it will inevitably mean a cut in essential services <e> <s> is the minister aware that four of those authorities namely haringey thamesdown sheffield and portsmouth have increased their expenditure by less than the average of all local authorities <e> <s> why are they included when the city of london is spending at per cent <e> <s> above its grant-related expenditure and is by far the biggest overspender <e>", "<cs> is the minister also aware that any reductions in rates will largely be achieved at the expense of the exchequer and therefore the ratepayers because of the manipulation of targets and penalties <e> <s> this statement goes far beyond the immediate rate capping <e> <s> the government are imposing a per cent <e> <s> cut in local services which will be enforced by an unprecedentedly harsh penalty regime starting at per cent <e> <s> for the first per cent <e> <s> of overspend an enormous increase on the present position with per cent <e> <s> for the second and then per cent for each per cent <e> <s> after that <e> <s> however rate capping will still be totally unable to provide this level of cuts <e> <s> therefore todays statement cannot be taken as being aimed solely at the hit list authorities it cuts deeply into all local government <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that nothing was removed from the disabled and that in fact the right to buy in relation to houses adapted for the disabled was brought in by the act it was not in the act at all <e> <s> further will he agree that the vast majority of houses adapted for the disabled have now come under the right to buy provisions and that it is only a small minority of those houses which have been extensively and therefore expensively adapted that are exempt from the right to buy <e> <s> i think that is a provision that he would agree many of us in this house were even then unhappy about <e>", "<cs> my lords i start by thanking the noble lord lord ashby for moving his motion this afternoon and giving this house an opportunity to discuss this very important report <e> <s> i sometimes feel that one of the reasons for sustaining the house of lords and its survival is that probably these commission reports would never be discussed if it were not for this house <e> <s> the noble lord lord nathan also moved his report extraordinarily well <e> <s> the two reports together have given us an enormous amount to chew on in one afternoon and my noble friend lady nicol will be concentrating largely on air pollution <e>",

have brought forward the legislation that is going to keep him up <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not want to interrupt the noble earl too much as this is his maiden speech so to speak as a minister but i cannot let that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank all those noble lords who have spoken in this very lengthy debate <e> <s> i am rather sorry for the minister that there were so few speakers on his side <e> <s> it would have been interesting for us and for him to have heard some enthusiastic support for what the government intend to do <e>", "<cs> my lords how can the minister say that this can only be beneficial to the construction industry when the housing budget for will be cut by million and when the reduced expectation of receipts from council house sales the vital lowering of the cash limit and inflation have all been taken into account <e> <s> is the minister aware that a million cut means the loss of jobs in the construction industry <e>", "<cs> since understandably the minister in replying to me has also taken in the arguments for amendments nos <e> <s> and perhaps in reply i may deal with some of those points <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> he is quite right <e> <s> it was not as sympathetic as i had hoped <e> <s> but it was not as bad as i had feared it might be <e> <s> i introduced the other amendments perhaps unwisely because i thought that the minister was covering the wider field <e> <s> i said i shall say it again briefly when we come to them that i was not too happy at the moment with their drafting because i see the point about the exclusiveness of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> there are also problems in connection with amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> the minister was talking before about the polluter pays but on this occasion the local authority certainly should not be paying <e> <s> it would be acting as an agent of the government in the same way as other bodies <e> <s> that was meant to be a i hope humorous aside <e>", "<cs> having now heard this and had an answer to a question as well as an explanation of the amendment and i hope the minister will agree having been the catalyst in raising the point which was put by the noble lord lord hunt i think in the circumstances we have been around this point enough <e> <s> i would be very interested in the answer that the minister gives to the noble lord lord hunt when he has investigated the matter further <e> <s> perhaps the minister will let me have a copy of the letter he writes to the noble lord lord hunt on his point about british sea-fishery <e>", "<cs> thank the noble lord very much <e> <s> just a signal that i am right would be very helpful <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i see the point that the minister has made but i think the advantage of the amendment not necessarily in the form in which it is drafted is that the local authority would be aware in advance of what was happening in its area <e> <s> the example i gave was of where material is imported from europe <e> <s> certainly in all cases it would not involve a <e>", "<cs> i am aware of that <e> <s> to be frank we do not have the amendment right <e> <s> i am not happy about the way that it is drafted but i think that there is an important enough point here for the government to have a look at it <e> <s> i shall certainly take the amendment back and have a look at it to see whether we can reach what we are trying to get at by an easier and better drafted means <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble earl the minister for reading the statement so beautifully <e> <s> as it is the first rate settlement statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to remind the minister that there were two or three questions that he did not answer <e> <s> i thank him for the answer to the question on the announcement to be made on capital grants although it does not seem to be in sight <e> <s> i asked him whether he would confirm that every council spending at target this year will receive less grant in real terms in <e> <s> i assume as he did not mention it that that is so <e> <s> that is the way it works out from the figures <e> <s> i asked him to tell us how many councils spending at target this year will receive less grant taking into account tsg <e> <s> i also put it to him that major spending councils will receive less in real terms <e> <s> i think that was a point that was also made in a slightly different way by the noble baroness lady stedman <e> <s> all these will add up to fewer services for the elderly fewer services all round and difficulties for local authorities maintaining what they have been trying so hard to maintain for all these years in the face of the difficult criteria set down by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords following the ministers answers to the two noble lords may i ask whether he is aware that two of the three boroughs that will be looking after hampstead heath will be rate-capped next year <e> <s> can he give assurances that his department will provide continuing funds to preserve the present high standard of maintenance and conservation of hampstead heath <e> <s> further do not the events that took place in another place last night reflect strong and passionate support for an elected authority for our capital city which is the appropriate body to run kenwood and hampstead heath together <e>", "<cs> my lords may i return to the point that the minister made that the vote last night was on a different subject <e> <s> it was not a different subject because this is an absolutely prime example of something for which an elected authority for london must be responsible <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble earl the minister for repeating that statement <e> <s> it is however just another tragic example of the governments harsh policies towards those least able to sustain them or to fight back <e> <s> the government intend to reduce the money available to local authorities which are already in desperate straits by what will amount to billion in capital expenditure across the board <e> <s> the prescribed proportion from housing receipts will be reduced from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> which represents a cut of million <e> <s> this again means that the government do not appear to be taking into account the housing conditions in this country the plight of the homeless the number of unemployed and the community who benefit from a healthy infrastructure <e> <s> the number of families accepted as homeless by local authorities continues to rise it is now more than annually <e> <s> how will this new measure help those people <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> that was second reading <e> <s> now we have seen a bare majority of and the bill still has quite a long way to go <e> <s> i do not think that the opposition in another place within the governments own party can be under-estimated since it takes a fundamental issue and a grave crisis of conscience and frustration for members of parliament of either house to vote against their own government <e> <s> this is something which is absolutely true and which the government have to take very seriously which <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not have the papers about procedure with me but i remember reading that there are a lot of precedents even for voting orders down in this house and for tabling amendments to them <e> <s> there are very many more than perhaps the noble lord seems to realise indeed many more than i realised until i looked it up <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord will give way <e> <s> the noble lord must agree that the indications do show what is going on <e> <s> when a government with a major piece of legislation and with an enormous majority in the other place are able only to produce a majority of on an amendment which has been moved by members of their own party he cannot decry that <e> <s> it was only one of the examples which i took <e> <s> i only raise it with him because he is making such a fuss of it and turning it on its head <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to prolong this debate but it is important that we get this right <e> <s> under the interpretation act which i quoted the order can he revoked <e> <s> i made it perfectly clear that it was up to the government to decide but what it means is that the governments hands are not tied and if enough expression of feeling came from this house that we were unhappy about this way of dealing with the elections then it would be up to the government to decide <e> <s> the government are not forced to do anything but at least they have the opportunity to think again about these elections <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i am going to win this one but i should like to remark on one or two of the comments made by other noble lords <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne said he could not wait to get rid of the glc <e> <s> he was answered so specifically and so vigorously by my noble friend lord sefton that i do not need to say anything more about that matter <e> <s> so far as the noble baroness lady stedman is concerned she made an excellent speech <e> <s> why she spoilt it with the comments she made towards the end i do not know <e> <s> still we are all entitled to our views and to freedom of activity <e>", "<cs> my lords am i to congratulate the noble baroness because her presence was not necessary in the glc or because it was necessary here <e>", "<cs> my lords where is the logic at the moment in compelling water authorities to increase their charges to the ratepayer at a time when local authorities are being forced to do exactly the opposite <e> <s> secondly is it not true as the cbi has pointed out that at a time when the target is to reduce industrial costs the increase of to per cent <e> <s> in real terms over the next three years for an essential commodity is a serious blow for manufacturing industry <e> <s> so is it not true that both domestic and industrial consumers are suffering very badly industry as a whole and the ratepayers as a whole through the governments actions alone <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to intervene again but the minister said that per cent <e> <s> is quite low which of course it is as an increase but it is not the real increase <e> <s> the real increase is the rate of current replacement which is four times as high and works out at per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the minister is delighted about that but i do not believe that the million or more people on the housing waiting list or the homeless families will feel very delighted nor will those people who need improvements to their homes <e> <s> is the minister aware of the very strong feelings expressed by a multitude of organisations concerned with construction and economics over the fact that neddy has calculated that it will cost disproportionately more to put right the longer we delay <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> i cannot say that it was very satisfactory from my point of view but he did explain it again <e> <s> what worries me is that it does not really help to have placed on record in <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister <e> <s> i express the hope that this main point of principle apart from the adminstrative details will be looked at again <e> <s> i hope that he will discuss that point once more with his right honourable friend because i should not like this situation to be left as it is at present <e> <s> the reason why i am not pressing this amendment further today is to give this matter another chance in the discussions which are to take place before third reading <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a brief word on this amendment to which i have put my name with that of my noble friend lady nicol <e> <s> what has been said by my noble friend lord melchett and the noble lord lord mackie of benshie is absolutely correct <e> <s> the two amendments are not on all fours though my impression is that the minister feels that they are <e> <s> they are saying different things <e> <s> the noble earl lord onslow said that it isolates the public interest but if he looks again he will find that the contrary is the case <e> <s> if he is using the <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i put this question to him <e> <s> despite what he has said i am still asking him to reconsider <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> a applies to a different part of the clause it relates to line <e> <s> that is a different set of words from those at line <e> <s> i think it should be put on record that there has been no implication that the minister the department or anyone else is acting in a sinister manner <e> <s> we are arguing that the way this has been drafted is not achieving the result that the minister has explained so eloquently <e> <s> i am afraid that we still feel that this is so <e> <s> that is why i ask the minister to reconsider <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for repeating the statement made in another place and to say first that the people of billingham certainly will be greatly relieved when they hear of this statement <e> <s> the trouble is that if one shifts the place one shifts the anxieties and what the statement does is to raise even more questions but with very few answers <e> <s> the instructions to nirex should be fully published not just in parliament and incidentally we have not yet had a chance to see the principles or the consultation instructions so that the public themselves can know what is going on <e> <s> this is a matter which causes enormous anxiety among people all over the country particularly in those areas certainly down the west coast where they are concerned that theirs may be the place that is next chosen for nuclear waste disposal <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to thank the minister for explaining this bill so clearly and also so briefly <e> <s> it is certainly not the type of bill which is going to get high television ratings but nevertheless its importance is very much greater than perhaps the interest displayed in it generally would appear to suggest <e> <s> the bill expresses an intention which all interested parties these include local authorities the british steel corporation geological and environmental groups support and my colleagues and i on these benches agree that although some details may need to be clarified and perhaps adjusted the bill is one which should be widely welcomed <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a number of points which i know the noble minister has to answer before he goes on to others but i should like him to deal with this because it was a point supported also by his noble friend lord middleton <e> <s> we are now discussing this bill in your lordships house but it started in another place <e> <s> i ask the minister to take this back to see whether it is possible to include this matter <e> <s> we are all used to the technical reasons i was trying to find a more felicitous word than excuse but that will do for a moment for not including items on the face of a bill <e> <s> this is important <e> <s> it does not involve putting in a special sum but saying subject to annual review <e> <s> with great respect assurance in writing to the ironstone royalty owners association has from my point of view exactly the same small amount of impact as its being in <e>", "<cs> my lords in spite of what both noble lords have said about this i still find it unconvincing <e> <s> the minister has said that there is a difference of opinion about whether it should be mentioned on the face of the bill <e> <s> my noble friends and i as well as the local authority associations consider that it should be so mentioned <e> <s> today i received a letter from the adc saying that it supported this proposal <e> <s> but it is not just a labour party or political move <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank the minister for repeating the statement made in another place and say that we on this side of the house feel that it is an important statement and also a timely one <e> <s> there has not been a full inquiry into local government or even a semi-inquiry since redcliffe-maud <e> <s> councillors and officers have an increasing burden to bear today which gets more difficult all the time <e>", "<cs> my lords on that point i wonder whether i may say that the minister would of course acknowledge that there is a difference between the internal inquiry into finance which is going on at the moment and the broader and external inquiry into finance in local government to which i think the noble baroness lady stedman and i were referring <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government raised the expenditure levels for rate-capped authorities <e> <s> if not will not the cuts be of even greater magnitude for those authorities since they will be having to pay more interest on their loan charges and <e>", "<cs> i first apologise to both the noble lord lord sandys and the noble lord lord mottistone and other noble lords for the lateness in tabling the amendment <e> <s> frankly one of the problems was that we are having the committee stage two days earlier than we should have done and this particular amendment literally arose over the weekend <e> <s> it seemed to me better to table it and to have an initial discussion on it because i was obviously not wrong in guessing that the minister would not say this afternoon yes that is lovely <e> <s> we accept it <e> <s> do not bother about it any more <e> <s> at least the amendment is on the order paper <e> <s> we have had a certain amount of discussion on it and there will be an opportunity to go into it in further detail later <e>", "<cs> i wondered what had happened <e> <s> i thought for a moment that the minister was perhaps speaking to a different amendment from the one that i moved <e> <s> unfortunately he is only too right what he is now saying is very different from what he said on second reading <e> <s> this afternoon we are probing and finding out what the government feel <e> <s> as the noble lord lord sandford said a few moments ago in regard to his amendments i do not intend to press any of my amendments today <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lord in this amendment <e> <s> if it is to be effective it means that eventually the government will accept either my amendments nos <e> <s> and or some form of them <e> <s> while i cannot see the government centrally accepting the cost of paying the compensation the noble lord lord sandford is absolutely right when he talks about the financial restrictions on local authorities today <e> <s> in addition to everything else it will be a very grievous problem for them <e> <s> therefore the cleanest simplest and best answer to this whole problem is to get rid of the compensation <e>", "<cs> i should just like to support the noble lords who moved the amendment to which i also have my name <e> <s> i can see that there is a problem here <e> <s> nevertheless when we are looking at these planning procedures even if this is supposed to be a short small bill we ought to get the best out of it that we can and a strong case has been made about the overshoot on pavements <e> <s> but where i take issue with the minister is when he talked about confiscating compensation rights <e> <s> if we are going to alter compensation rights which many of us want to do by the amendments moved today there is no question of confiscating anything <e> <s> we are just trying to see that they are either cancelled out or dispensed with <e> <s> i do not think that the word confiscated is correct and in these circumstances it gives a wrong impression <e>", "<cs> i should also like to say how pleased i am to see this amendment on the marshalled list in the name of the minister <e> <s> the only proviso i would add is that i hope it will be possible during the progress of this bill to extend the horizons a little further <e> <s> but this is a very good start top marks <e>", "<cs> in view of what the minister says i shall naturally withdraw the amendment and come back to it again later <e> <s> in doing so i should say that the great importance is protection <e> <s> i do not mind under which schedule or article it is done <e> <s> the important point is the protection of listed buildings <e> <s> i am absolutely aware that they have a protection in one way but at the moment the conservation areas do not not in the terms in which we are speaking today <e> <s> in view of the support from other noble lords who have put their names to the amendment but have restrained themselves from speaking in the interests of time and the tremendous support from all over the country for the amendment even if the minister would like it differently drafted i hope that he will accept that this is a very serious matter <e> <s> i withdraw the amendment in the hope that the minister will find a way to solve it from his point of view and at least leave us with the protection that is absolutely necessary <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the minister <e> <s> he is absolutely right <e> <s> a bill of this sort cannot be passed with the opportunity for abuses which must arise <e> <s> as the minister explained very clearly abuses would certainly arise particularly in this area of planning applications <e> <s> i hope that the minister sticks to his guns about the date and i am sure he will so that there cannot be an abuses however few <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the amendment in the name of the noble viscount lord craigavon and myself <e> <s> at the committee stage of the bill the amendments that i moved proposed that the right to compensation should be removed where there was a national amendment to a development order or an article direction <e> <s> the removal then was to be total without any period of grace for the submission of claims <e> <s> today the amendment moved by the noble lord lord montagu and now the amendment to the amendment are concerned with a very much narrower area <e> <s> i completely support the amendment referring to conservation areas proposed by the noble lord lord montagu apart from the -month period of grace which frankly i do not like <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what the noble viscount has said and the fact that we went over this in committee i give him my support as i have my name to his amendment but i do not think that there is any reason at this time in the evening for me to say anything more about it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with very great pleasure that i rise to support this amendment moved by the noble lord lord montagu <e> <s> a few minutes ago the minister mentioned that his assurances were received so quietly <e> <s> i think the point is certainly so far as we on these benches are concerned that assurances are all right up to a point but meanwhile as has been pointed out by my noble friend lady white and others a tremendous amount of damage and loss can take place during that period <e> <s> the amendment that we are now discussing is really a very narrow amendment <e> <s> it is designed simply to remove the right to claim compensation if permission is refused for an extension to any building which existed in july and which is situated in a conservation area <e> <s> that is all it does <e> <s> it has really come down to a very narrow point indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first of all apologise to the minister and to the house for only having arrived when the minister was on his feet <e> <s> i thought that the films bill would take longer than in fact it did <e> <s> this bill has had very much wider mauling if i may use that word in this house than it received in another place where it whizzed through almost like a hot knife through ice cream without very much deliberation <e> <s> i should like to say immediately from these benches that we appreciate very much the fact that the noble lord lord skelmersdale was thrown into the middle of the bill at a fairly vigorous report stage <e> <s> we recognise the difficulties he probably had <e> <s> i should like also to take this opportunity to say how sorry we are that his noble friend lord avon is ill and to wish him a speedy recovery <e> <s> i think we should all be grateful if that message could be passed on to him <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put that right <e> <s> i was adding together the time taken to get the consultation paper out for the consultation paper to receive responses and for the government to consider them and perhaps to introduce legislation <e> <s> i find that this is the general time scale which is accepted by most people and not just by me <e>", "<cs> i think the noble earl lord gowrie said something about public money <e> <s> the amount of public money that is being wasted in trying to put through this wretched piece of legislation is absolutely outrageous <e> <s> the government are meddling with a structure of local government while bucking the major policy issues <e> <s> there will almost undoubtedly be another major upheaval within the next decade possibly sooner <e> <s> but can our structure of local <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may intervene i have tried very hard not to interrupt the noble lord because i am aware of time but he cannot get away with what he has just said <e> <s> the london boroughs will not have the same amount of money to give to voluntary organisations as those organisations have been receiving from the glc <e> <s> i shall be very happy to give the noble lord a copy of a non-political statement which has been produced by the london association of voluntary services which points out the difficulty <e> <s> because they will have no stated income they will have to depend on boroughs which as the right reverend prelate quite rightly pointed out are in difficulties themselves because of their own limited resources <e> <s> they will not be able to spare the sums required <e> <s> that is so <e> <s> i am sorry but it is a fact <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords i really tried not to intervene because of the reasons that the noble lord lord bellwin has given but he has now twice mentioned me in connection with this bill and i must say something <e> <s> he said that i had not said that most of <e>", "<cs> my lords some time ago yesterday i moved an amendment to the second reading motion <e> <s> over speeches later i now rise to wind up the debate on that particular amendment <e> <s> i shall resist the enticing temptation of trying to explain to the noble viscount leader of the house why we consider that democratic rights are lost in this bill and also to try to clear up his concern about the metropolitan counties which i assure him are extremely happy about this amendment <e>", "<cs> yes the noble lord may say hear hear but that is not what is happening <e> <s> something entirely different is being done <e> <s> the functions are not going to the boroughs and the districts <e> <s> the boroughs and the districts will be handling much less of the expenditure of the services with which the metropolitan counties and the glc are concerned than will the joint boards joint committees and other quangos <e> <s> in fact per cent <e> <s> of expenditure of the glc will go directly to the boroughs and per cent <e> <s> directly to the districts <e> <s> therefore it will not be simpler and the services will not be closer to the voter though that was the point made by the noble lord lord elton when he opened the debate at second reading <e> <s> local democracy and accountability will be far less and not greater <e> <s> that has been pointed out by numerous newspapers and various people who have commented on this <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the minister so early on but i think it would be a pity if we started off on the wrong foot <e> <s> it would have been unfair of me not to have made it clear that i did not like the bill but i think that i also made it clear to the point of tedium that i was discussing a very narrow amendment and a limited inquiry in order to improve the bill <e> <s> that is what the amendment is about <e> <s> it is no good the minister trying to widen it <e>", "<cs> i wonder if the noble lord will give way for a moment <e> <s> i am sorry but i really cannot let him get away with saying that the amendment i moved is a wrecking amendment which would delay the bill <e> <s> it does not have to delay it at all <e> <s> the arrangements would go on as the government want them to go on while the inquiry sat <e> <s> the inquiry would report it would then be up to the secretary of state as the minister pointed out there is a problem and i see it but it is the only fair and right way to do it to take action or not <e> <s> it is quite wrong and totally unfair and inaccurate for the noble lord to say with all the magisterial authority at his command that this is a wrecking amendment which would delay the bill <e> <s> it is not <e>", "<cs> we have had a long and lively debate as the noble earl said <e> <s> if i may i think i shall first take up some of the remarks of the soft policeman as he termed himself before i get to the hard cop <e> <s> if this amendment and the debate are not something of substance i am surprised that we have had a cabinet minister wheeled in to wind up on it <e> <s> we have had our very distinguished minister of state who took it to himself to speak immediately after me and we have had i do not know how to describe them all the noble lords lord boyd-carpenter lord campbell of alloway lord beloff and now lord bellwin who are all highly qualified to speak and who all come to the aid of the party at a very high level <e> <s> so i do not think one can talk of this as not being of any substance <e>", "<cs> yes they were because she was quoting what had been said by the sub-committee on science and technology <e> <s> one of the other points she made which i should like to reinforce is this <e> <s> we are all aware of the amount of material we have received and of pressures and discontent from organisations of every kind <e> <s> i shall not take up the time of the committee by listing them because we know them <e> <s> however i think there is something of which we should take note <e> <s> it is that i am sure all of us have received and are continuing to receive more and more updated material since this bill went through the house of commons <e> <s> it did not stop there <e> <s> thus the dissatisfaction is just the same and in many cases is greater <e> <s> now it is being transferred to this chamber and we are being asked what we can do <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord not agree that it would be better if we proceeded with the amendment instead of having all these recommendations <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the noble lord is but perhaps he will wait until i am out of the way to make signs <e> <s> i hope quite seriously that we can rest ore a little better humour in the committee than has existed for the last couple of hours <e> <s> it seems quite wrong <e> <s> we are debating a very important bill <e> <s> there are i agree strong feelings about it <e> <s> but it will not get us anywhere at this very early stage of the bill if one gets upset about it <e> <s> so after that ticking off i hope that everyone will behave better <e>", "<cs> the minister has not yet said whether he agrees with the amendment <e> <s> he has explained that it is not at all alarming <e> <s> if that is so i <e>", "<cs> i find that a strange answer <e> <s> if the government do not think it is necessary i again come back to the point i was making <e> <s> we are in a parliamentary democracy not an authoritarian state and people are concerned about this matter as are other political parties <e> <s> we are all i hope moving towards or we feel that we should like to move towards more open government <e> <s> in those circumstances what on earth is wrong in the secretary of state giving an account of what he is doing <e>", "<cs> in that case i find it totally unsatisfactory because nobody has asked the minister or the secretary of state to take those powers unto himself <e> <s> when secretaries of state do this they must find some method of making it clear and explaining what they are doing to the people <e> <s> i think we are all entitled to know <e> <s> it is our money they are using not their own <e> <s> again because of the lateness of the hour i <e>", "<cs> i shall speak to the two amendments of the noble lord lord hayter and the noble lord lord molson <e> <s> before doing so i must take up some of the comments made by the minister who has just spoken <e> <s> he started off by saying that what the amendments do is just trim what is already in existence the glc and the metropolitan county councils <e> <s> that in fact is absolutely untrue as i shall seek to show <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is quite right the reasoned amendment referred to a framework for strategic services <e> <s> that is correct <e> <s> nevertheless i and a great many other noble lords some of whom did riot support the amendment but afterwards explained to some of my noble friends and myself why they did not believe that that amendment was treated at second reading as a vote of confidence in the government and a vote of confidence in the bill <e> <s> that is entirely different from discussing individual amendments today once the house is in committee <e>", "<cs> the minister then went on to talk about abolition how that had been decided and how anything of this nature was contrary to that decision <e> <s> i put it to him that in taking the best part out of what one is abolishing preserving that and improving upon it one is doing something constructive <e> <s> this is what these two amendments set out to do <e> <s> on the other hand if with the machinery of abolition one gets rid of the good with the not so good or the bad however it is described ones actions are destructive <e>", "<cs> what i said was that these amendments set up the structure <e> <s> there are further amendments already on the marshalled list which deal with the functions <e> <s> in fact i have two such amendments in my name following <e> <s> they run all through the marshalled list of amendments from all sides of the committee <e> <s> we are not making them up at all <e>", "<cs> i rise to support this series of amendments to which i have added my name <e> <s> i feel that they have been very well spoken to in the first place by the noble baroness lady stedman who moved them and then by the noble viscount lord esher who expressed so much better than i can the way i feel about these amendments <e>", "<cs> he is absolutely right to do so <e>", "<cs> it warms my heart to hear the noble lord say those words because on one occasion when i was sitting on his side of the chamber a note arrived and i said this does not make sense <e> <s> so then a further note arrived and i could not read the writing and i said this makes less sense <e> <s> thus i am glad to hear that we all get into the same box at times <e>", "<cs> yes we have <e>", "<cs> i have <e>", "<cs> i have considerable sympathy with what the noble lord lord sandford is attempting to do <e> <s> he is obviously trying to find a mechanism for selecting one voice to represent what might be quite disparate voices gathered together over this question of co-ordination and coherence in planning policy <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> i was just asking my noble friend how she was today <e>", "<cs> my answer to what the minister has said is well he would have to say that wouldnt he <e> <s> he has to defend what is in the bill even though it makes i still maintain for much greater confusion and more complication <e> <s> my noble friends lady lockwood and lady fisher of rednal are absolutely right <e> <s> they have made out powerful cases that have not been answered by the minister <e> <s> the noble lord said something about criticism of civil servants <e> <s> that is not the point <e> <s> the point is that ministers will be overloaded with what is put on them <e> <s> i do not imagine that the noble lord or his right honourable friend are going to be able to spend a great deal of time and even if they did spend from morning to night and did not sleep at all they would still not be able to deal personally with all the powers given them in the bill <e> <s> so of course it comes down to the civil servants to different layers of different civil servants doing these jobs <e>", "<cs> i should first like to thank my noble friend lord shinwell for his very encouraging intervention and also for the way in which he has pinpointed the governments obduracy about this bill <e> <s> i am thinking now of its passage through the commons <e> <s> we have not yet got very far with it here <e> <s> the signs so far are not very bright but of course the government could put all that right by showing much more flexibility and give <e> <s> i hope that the very wise words of my very experienced noble friend lord shinwell may encourage the government to be a little more flexible in their approach particularly when these are really practical matters <e> <s> we are not talking about what they may consider to be points of political principle <e>", "<cs> i said he is a clever young man i did not say he is not <e> <s> i said he is a clever young man but not as experienced as the noble viscount lord esher <e> <s> i do not want to upset him and i did not say anything critical <e>", "<cs> i am a little worried about the way the minister put that <e> <s> he is saying all right the amendment is not the right amendment the government think that and so does the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i will do that as well <e> <s> we will all get together on the adc <e> <s> if i understood from what the minister was saying that he will take it back and consider it i am content about that <e> <s> i accept that he is not accepting the amendment as it is but if we can achieve some improvement even if it is on a slightly varied point that at least is making a little progress <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder if i may support the amendment moved by the noble baroness lady stedman <e> <s> i think that she herself acknowledged that it is not a very weighty amendment but it is a very useful one as i see it <e> <s> i think that really it is on a rather different point from that dealt with in the next amendment of the noble lord lord molson <e> <s> it strikes me as having the advantage of making the secretary of states guidance more open to public scrutiny but it proposes that local authorities not only have regard to such guidance in the preparation of plans but also have to state in the explanatory memorandum how such guidance has influenced the formulation of policy <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount lord colville of culross has been very explicit and articulate in what he has said about the amendment <e> <s> i think that by the complexity of his own arguments he has illustrated the complexity of the bill as well <e>", "<cs> may i first just give a brief answer in principle <e> <s> it seems to me that this is a circular matter which runs through the bill <e> <s> the whole bill is full of areas where we do not know how things stand <e> <s> we have to take things as they are <e> <s> i think that it would be quite wrong not to make some form of improvement while we are waiting for yet another problem area to come up as we are slipping into these all the time <e>", "<cs> i shall speak to my amendment <e>", "<cs> i did not quite hear what the noble lord said <e> <s> did he say he intended to table an amendment that will in fact put this situation right <e> <s> i may be wrong but i understood him to say he was reading from a brief that it was possible to do this that and the other <e> <s> but what we want to see in the bill in the schedule quite frankly is a reversal of what is there at the moment <e> <s> it reads very clearly there is nothing obtuse at all about the drafting and unless this is what the noble lord is offering i do not think we can find it acceptable <e>", "<cs> in that case i must test the opinion of the committee and i hope that noble lords will take the point that it really is something that should be in the bill <e>", "<cs> i do not intend to press any of the amendments that i am moving now <e> <s> i am really concerned about this subject and i am also trying to get information <e> <s> i have to remember too when listening to the ministers honeyed words that he is on the side of the treasury as well as of the angels <e>", "<cs> it was very helpful to hear the intervention of the noble lord lord montagu but perhaps i may put one or two points to the minister <e> <s> the glcs expenditure on the archaeological service in was around <e> <s> is the minister able to give an assurance that that amount will be available for archaeology for the historic buildings and monuments commission <e> <s> secondly it is important to distinguish between the project funding of individual digs and the core funding for continuing professional services to provide an integrated service <e> <s> this is where a very deep financial and resource problem arises when you cannot keep a service of trained skilled and experienced people going and they then have to melt away <e> <s> what i am asking for is rather more assurance than i feel i have at the moment <e> <s> i shall not press this to a division but as i said in moving the amendment this is not mentioned in the bill and i am concerned about the future of archaeology as are the many bodies that have naturally been in touch with me and with other people <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for those words and of course we shall have to wait and see <e> <s> it depends on what the funds turn out to be and whether they are enough for archaeology so that money does not have to be stretched away from all the other areas with which the historic buildings and monuments commission is concerned <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> however i am still a little worried about the actual system that i a m talking about and the technology involved <e> <s> we have to look at this in an international as well as a national context <e> <s> it is quite outstanding <e> <s> what i should like to know is whether all the machinery the work the computers and so on is going over to the historic buildings and monuments commission because otherwise with all the good will in the world it cannot parallel what is being done by the glc unless it has the necessary equipment to do it <e> <s> perhaps the minister can advise me on that <e>", "<cs> the noble lord will soon be wondering why he is abolishing the glc <e>", "<cs> i hope that when everything is transferred they do not forget to take the computers with them <e> <s> with what i hope were assurances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the hour is very late <e> <s> i am very conscious that if we do not make more progress my noble friend who has been extremely helpful on this amendment will not reach his own amendments tonight <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the minister is doing the best he can <e> <s> many of us however are worried about the possible outcome <e> <s> i do not believe that he has any influence over it although he is doing his best <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister very much for that explanation <e> <s> this amendment expresses real concern about the care of these buildings <e> <s> the reference to adequate technical expertise was not in order to criticise the commission for not having it but in order to make sure that with the extra responsibilities the commission is given the resources to employ the extra expertise and necessary staff <e> <s> that was the reason <e> <s> i beg leave <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> yes i think they can all be dealt with together <e>", "<cs> may i just explain and it might help the minister as well in regard to what the noble lord has just asked about <e> <s> i think the reason is that for over years now <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the amendments have been grouped so that most of these major amendments on waste disposal are together <e> <s> i am sorry <e>", "<cs> i am speaking to the next one on hazardous waste which is really incorporated in this and there are other amendments which do not apply to me at all but i am coming on to that point now <e>", "<cs> yes i am sorry <e> <s> i thought it was for the noble lord the chairman of committees <e>", "<cs> i am speaking now to amendment no <e> <s> b and to amendments nos <e> <s> c and <e>", "<cs> what i said and i am sorry that the noble lord the minister seems to find me so difficult to understand today was that the residuary bodies are in the bill and i take it that he would agree that that is so <e> <s> they are in clause <e> <s> at the moment they are there for five years but the secretary of state can prolong their lives <e> <s> i was saying that they could be made permanent if it is the will of parliament that they should be <e> <s> that is what i was saying <e>", "<cs> noble lords may laugh but it is something that affects everybody and it has to be undertaken by whoever may be the government or the local authority <e> <s> what i am saying is that if a system is working well you should change it only if you can improve upon it <e> <s> all that we have seen so far are the plans in the bill which would make it a far worse and more ineffective system <e> <s> i quoted very distinguished expert sources to support the point of view that you should change it only if you can improve it <e> <s> this is an outstanding example of the importance of this chamber using its revising powers in the interests of millions of people in this country who will be gravely affected by whatever is decided in this very important area and to whom we owe a deep responsibility <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> this is the committee stage but i have always been taught to believe since i have been in this house that when one is discussing an amendment at committee stage one should try to restrict oneself to the amendment <e> <s> i am discussing the amendment which is before us amendment no <e> <s> b <e> <s> the minister knows perfectly well that as parliament can do anything it can certainly make this residuary body permanent <e> <s> we shall hear the governments view later no doubt <e>", "<cs> whatever form the residuary body takes in order to guarantee continuity and consistency there will have to be a permanent body set up <e> <s> that makes sense <e> <s> there are powers in the bill to have a strategic body <e> <s> there is no point in having a strategic body for a very short time <e> <s> we believe in a strategic body and if your lordships decide that a strategic body is necessary obviously one would expect an element of permanence to be attached to the strategic bodies <e>", "<cs> not at all <e> <s> the minister has no right to draw that conclusion <e> <s> it will go into a residuary <e>", "<cs> i really must intervene otherwise words that i have not spoken will be put into my mouth and i really cannot allow that <e> <s> i said that the residuary bodies would then become as they would have to permanent bodies and whether they were appointed or elected would be a matter for your lordships <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord <e> <s> i am certainly not very touchy i quite enjoyed the exchange it livened things up <e> <s> but i did not think the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter was very courteous <e> <s> i do not like being told to sit down and wait for a moment i would not have treated him in that way <e> <s> i just want to say before this point gets lost in a rather lengthy debate that i think the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter is a debater of almost olympic standards <e> <s> however this is not the oxford union it is not a debating society <e> <s> we are discussing the future of a very important function which affects everybodys lives <e> <s> if i may say so it seems to have become confused between the collection responsibilities of the boroughs and districts and the waste disposal responsibilities which although in a wide sphere are part of local government were in fact set up as waste disposal authorities <e> <s> i do not know if the noble lord is aware of that <e>", "<cs> i listened very carefully to what the minister said in reply to this quite lengthy and interesting debate <e> <s> i must confess that i did not find his arguments convincing to any degree at all <e> <s> he said that he was looking forward to receiving views on paper which will be put out by the government <e> <s> it is hard to understand why the government need any more views on any more papers when they have had the report of the select committee chaired by the noble earl lord cranbrook <e> <s> they have also had the report of my noble friend lord gregsons select committee on hazardous <e>", "<cs> with great respect to the noble lord lord home of the hirsel as i read it and as i think any other noble lord reading it would agree the amendment does not set up an overall authority <e> <s> in my submission it is not a matter of principle <e> <s> as the noble lord lord molson explained very thoroughly and succinctly and the noble viscount lord ingleby as well added to our knowledge on this what it is doing is gathering together police fire and passenger transport authorities which are in the bill anyway <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> i do not accept that at all <e> <s> they are bodies that have been set up <e> <s> we are not setting up new bodies and then gathering them together <e> <s> they are bodies dealing with functional services <e> <s> all that the amendment says is that these interlink <e> <s> to continue the sentence when the noble lord intervened there is the obvious police-fire link which all of us must agree go together <e> <s> there is then the link between highways and the policing of traffic control measures <e> <s> as to waste disposal the transport of waste and hazardous materials is very relevant <e> <s> this is a purely functional matter <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down although flattery will get him almost anywhere it certainly cannot extend to trying to read my mind <e> <s> the noble lord cannot look into the future with or without his crystal ball <e> <s> i was talking to the amendment and it is the amendment before us <e> <s> we are not talking about going back to a glc or a metropolitan county council we are not talking about them being elected <e>", "<cs> we are in committee <e> <s> i would remind the noble earl lord onslow that there is provision in the bill itself for joint committees and i cannot see what all the big fuss is about <e> <s> evidently the governments supporters are absolutely terrified that anything should be done to improve the bill which is our job that is to help revise it to save the taxpayer money and to enable the bill to work more efficiently <e> <s> they just think that the word abolition applies to everything and everybody <e>", "<cs> certainly not i shall not say that i shall or shall not do anything at all <e> <s> this is just ridiculous it is childish <e> <s> i expect better of the minister than that <e> <s> we are not playing kindergarten games <e>", "<cs> i am not going to say that <e> <s> this is absolutely ridiculous <e> <s> are noble lords so uncertain of themselves that if they are faced with something that makes sense like the amendment moved by the noble lord lord molson i was going to say moved by my noble friend but i had better not it will do him no good they are not alive enough and cannot read and take in any other amendments that come forward and treat each of them on its merits <e> <s> it is just absurd to take one amendment and say that it will lead here there and everywhere it is nonsense <e> <s> it must be examined on its merits to see what it says and then noble lords will see the sense of it <e>", "<cs> perhaps i too may add my thanks <e> <s> i have said i think more than once how inflexible the government are <e> <s> it is very good to hear of this little piece of flexibility <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord has misread the amendment <e> <s> i interrupt because in a lowlier position i also had responsibility for the royal parks in the previous labour government and i also feel that they should not go to any other body <e> <s> but this amendment refers to <e>", "<cs> will the minister allow me to interpose on this <e> <s> i think i raised some of these points when we discussed clause earlier in the committee stage <e> <s> i am still concerned about the question of adequate funds for the commission <e> <s> it will be undertaking a great deal of extra work and responsibility <e> <s> at least when the commission started and i was involved in the legislation which led to setting it up it had a certain amount of money behind it in order to get going and so that it had some resources and reserves to fall back on <e>", "<cs> i was <e>", "<cs> just a slight ignorance of history <e> <s> of course the minister was not discourteous <e> <s> what i was really trying to do was to avoid as the time is late having another debate on clause stand part so i rather enlarged this as we were in this area <e> <s> of course i am aware and in government i was responsible for the very area we are discussing tonight <e> <s> but i was never faced with this sort of takeover if you like of a great deal of extra responsibility and extra matters to be dealt with without extra money in order to cope with them <e>", "<cs> that is much better <e> <s> i am reassured now especially if the chairman of the commission is happy about it <e> <s> i wanted to make sure that it had a good enough financial start <e> <s> i was aware of the rolling programme but you need to have enough to start rolling <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to take part in this particular debate but i found myself becoming more and more transfixed as i listened to the contributions <e> <s> i have thought for a long while that there was a great deal wrong with this bill <e> <s> even if i had not thought so hearing the kind of discussion which is now taking place in this committee really makes one wonder what we are letting ourselves and the boroughs and districts in for <e>", "<cs> my i ask the noble baroness since she seems to be very involved in this are the boroughs queueing up and fighting with the glc because they want to provide these child care centres which the glc insists on doing <e> <s> is there that sort of situation <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the minister for that very full reply <e> <s> i was pleased to hear the way the governments intentions were expressed so far as equal opportunities are concerned <e> <s> i only wish i felt as optimistic and hopeful as the minister evidently does about the resources and where they are going to come from <e> <s> but at this time of night i will beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the minister has given a full answer but like my noble friend lord pitt i am not satisfied <e> <s> he is taking so much for granted <e> <s> first he is assuming that the boroughs and districts will all carry out what is being carried out on a county-wide area basis <e> <s> the fear is that even if they are willing to do it and have the resources to do it it cannot be done properly and efficiently for the people unless it is done on a much wider area <e>", "<cs> i was a little unclear about what the minister said <e> <s> i share what may be some of the confusion that the noble lord lord tordoff expressed <e> <s> my feeling when the minister started speaking was that he was talking about bringing forward an amendment which as i understood it would be very much along the lines of amendment no <e> <s> now before the committee <e> <s> further into his speech the noble lord seemed to be relying upon what is already in the bill <e> <s> he explained how under various clauses and schedules what had been mentioned was built into the bill <e> <s> it is this aspect that is rather mystifying some of us <e> <s> is the minister intending to bring forward an amendment on report <e> <s> or is he relying on what as he explained carefully is in the bill <e> <s> we are a little confused <e>", "<cs> i do <e>", "<cs> it is an improvement on the bill <e> <s> i am not misleading the minister <e> <s> i am not going to press it to a division but as i think that most things would be an improvement on the bill it would be awfully difficult for me to speak about the bill without saying something improving <e>", "<cs> there were a number of points that i wanted to take up but they were mainly points that were raised by the noble viscount <e> <s> he talked about how the secretary of state had issued guidance for areas when he was in the territory of my noble friend who sits behind me the area of the west midlands <e> <s> when he spoke about the secretary of states guidance a great deal of what he was saying was really being done by the west midlands county council and the forum of county councils <e> <s> however that is by the way <e>", "<cs> the work in the past had been done by the west midlands county council unless we are talking about two different areas of work <e> <s> perhaps we should sort that matter out afterwards <e> <s> i do not think that strategic guidance is firmly built into the present system but structure plans are built in <e> <s> i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> we have given the subject another airing <e> <s> i do not think that we have had a great meeting of minds on it but in view of the time and the number of amendments still to follow on i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is very late but really i cannot let clause pass without making as brief a comment as i can <e> <s> i do not intend to oppose the question but i must make some comment on it as the noble baroness lady stedman who has joined me on this has had to go <e>", "<cs> i did not say it was terrifying it was the noble lord who said it was terrifying <e> <s> what i said was that it was very bad <e> <s> it does not have to go to the councils because if the secretary of state makes the decision and intervenes that is where the matter rests <e> <s> it is the secretary of states power against which i am arguing which removes from the local council whether it be district or borough the power to make decisions in its own right <e> <s> i am sorry that probably through having condensed by intervention so much it may not have been as clear as it should have been <e> <s> but the noble lord need not fear i shall return to it <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but certainly i cannot possibly welcome this new clause <e> <s> one reason why i am speaking to it now and i shall do so briefly is because the minister brought it in aid when we were discussing the scientific and technological amendments but it did not seem right at that point to go into the ins and outs of this question because we were in fact discussing those amendments <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that the minister did not actually move it or speak to it he just referred to it in passing <e> <s> he did not say he was going to speak to it <e> <s> exactly the same sort of thing occurred on clause bringing in the two-thirds majority and so on <e> <s> i only wish that we could stimulate as much interest in this to help make it successful in a division so that it may receive an endowment fund but there are not enough of us present tonight to be able to promote that point <e>", "<cs> i cannot do anything else about that <e> <s> it is beyond my control <e> <s> it is not because i want it to go in <e> <s> but i am absolutely certain that when it was referred to earlier in committee many members of the committee were then concentrating on the other amendments and probably had not read this one very thoroughly <e> <s> it is not a good enough alternative <e> <s> to put the specialist services into a residuary body for the time being is one thing but i think the minister will find that i shall not be alone in my opposition to putting them into something like this <e> <s> i shall not repeat myself all over again because i think everyone is getting very tired <e>", "<cs> i have listened very carefully to the minister <e> <s> it was quite difficult because there were a great many complicated points with which he dealt at length <e> <s> i am not criticising that because i think it was very helpful to us that he should <e>", "<cs> make up your minds but i think that the minister should speak first <e>", "<cs> do keep quiet for a moment to let us get on <e> <s> it is nearly one oclock everybody wants their lunch <e>", "<cs> the minister really did not need that help <e> <s> he made himself perfectly clear <e> <s> he did not need an interpreter <e> <s> he did not say that he would take this amendment back for another look <e> <s> the minister was frank and honest <e> <s> he presented a whole series of extremely complicated alternatives which even if they threaded together which i doubt would not do the job and would not deal with the immediate problem that concerns us <e> <s> in that case i intend to divide the committee <e>", "<cs> i cannot let this new clause go by without making a number of comments <e> <s> subsection seeks to lay an entirely new and sweeping statutory duty on all the relevant authorities and their officers <e> <s> as the minister explained that duty is <e>", "<cs> the minister has underlined the point i was making <e> <s> he says that this is just a general statement <e> <s> he compared it with something that one of the right reverend prelates might say from the pulpit <e> <s> i do not believe that the right reverend prelates would agree for one moment that what they say should be lifted and put into a piece of legislation but that is what the minister is doing <e> <s> he is doing exactly that <e> <s> that is what i object to <e>", "<cs> even in regard to this bill our job is not to legislate for people to be good <e> <s> where would that lead us <e> <s> we were talking earlier about slippery <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord does not mind i shall finish <e> <s> i do not have much more to say and i am coming to a part where i can give a little to the minister <e> <s> i should like to make one quotation from the glcs director-general maurice stonefrost cbe <e> <s> he said <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may respond to what the minister said and thank him on behalf of this side of the committee and perhaps everyone for what he said about the proceedings on this committee stage <e> <s> i must tell the noble lord that although we do not like the bill we like him very much <e> <s> the minister has really had a very difficult job and i cannot resist saying that it has been made more difficult by the nature of the bill <e> <s> however he has kept his cool so far as it is possible to do <e> <s> i think that the best help we can be now is to let him have some lunch or tea <e>", "<cs> my lords we have an amendment on the metropolitan counties moved by the noble baroness lady stedman and an amendment on london <e> <s> the metropolitan counties and the glc situations are slightly different but the thrust is exactly the same and these amendments are aiming at largely the same situation <e> <s> my noble friends on these benches and i support the amendments and all those which have been grouped together <e> <s> i shall not spell them out now <e> <s> what we are discussing is of course strategic planning <e> <s> it is not a phrase that trips off everyones tongue every day of the week <e> <s> nevertheless the matters which it embraces are of tremendous importance <e> <s> they are rapidly becoming very well known to everyone and are talked about <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will give way for a moment <e> <s> yes i shall do my best to be as well informed as i can <e> <s> i try to be well informed the whole time even on this difficult subject <e> <s> however it is not in the bill <e> <s> the bill is completely vague on this matter <e> <s> as far as the bill is concerned there is nothing in it which replaces our present system of strategic planning <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> i am sure that he sent the letter but i have not received it <e> <s> had i received it i would have read it and had i read it i would not have pretended that i had not read it <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister puts me in an almost impossible position <e> <s> the discussion on planning started at second reading when several noble lords raised the whole question of planning and strategic planning <e> <s> at committee stage we had two further big bites at that cherry <e> <s> there were amendments moved on an earlier clause and on a later clause of the bill <e> <s> they were probing amendments but they were strongly put at the same time <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister because he is trying to be as helpful as he can <e> <s> i still cannot help feeling it is a pity that this whole debate did not take place between committee and report <e> <s> this amendment and amendments similar to it have been on the marshalled list for a long time <e> <s> i trust i can now accept that the minister will go away and consult and that something will appear along the lines of what is evidently wanted not only by this side of the house but all round the house <e> <s> i hope also that amendments will be published on the marshalled list in plenty of time for all of us to be able to consider what we want to do about them <e> <s> that is most important because we cannot have things sprung on us at the last minute particularly on third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i do my very best <e> <s> it is often difficult as the minister knows <e> <s> as he pointed out earlier he has a bigger staff than i have <e> <s> in view of that undertaking which i accept seriously i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not happy about this amendment <e> <s> there seems to have been some confusion about this and this amendment has not solved the problem for me <e> <s> i cannot speak for the noble lord lord campbell of alloway but re-reading what took place when this matter was originally debated i should not have thought that this has become clearer for him either <e> <s> the noble lord lord skelmersdale will remember what he said when this arose <e> <s> it was on a question of structure plans that the amendment arose <e> <s> i was concerned that these plans would disappear and not be used unless beforehand they had been agreed to and accepted by the secretary of state <e> <s> the feeling among many people was that a great deal of work would go into a waste-bin that it would be a costly exercise and very unfortunate for planning departments <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i must ask him something <e> <s> i have found my place in the schedule <e> <s> all this does is to take out <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not rise to speak at all in this debate because my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones covered the field so extremely well and thoroughly <e> <s> also it was very interesting to hear what the noble baroness lady macleod said but as i am also a magistrate in middlesex i felt i had to express the feelings of all my fellow magistrates on my bench highgate middlesex and other magistrates in middlesex and this is irrespective of their political party or other views <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i could intervene and help in some measure to put the noble lords mind at rest <e> <s> i shall not be moving amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be in the interests of the house if i now moved the manuscript amendment which as i think was explained was an oversight and not that it was put down late in the public bill office <e>", "<cs> my lords it is in the hands of the house <e> <s> the arguments are largely the same <e> <s> i am not moving my amendment <e> <s> i have my name down to the same amendment as the noble lord lord beloff and my noble friend <e> <s> i think that it would be clear if i just spoke to my amendment while at the same time supporting the amendment moved by my noble friend unless there is any objection to that <e> <s> the noble lord lord beloff can then make his position which he has already indicated absolutely clear <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that the noble lord lord campbell would be in a better position to make up his mind on what he thinks about my amendment if both amendments are discussed together <e> <s> this is not a party political matter in my view but if it is the wish of the house we can discuss the amendments separately <e> <s> i just thought that it would save time <e> <s> i think that noble lords can keep clearly in their minds what they are supporting and what they are not supporting <e>", "<cs> my lords what i was trying to say was that as i understand it and as the minister has said there are current papers and current records <e> <s> he is right <e> <s> then there are those papers to which one wants to refer from time to time which are more modern than the antiquated or ancient archives to which one refers perhaps very infrequently <e> <s> i think the position is as the minister has said <e> <s> it is because the archivists themselves feel that such archives should be placed with the residuary body rather than going to the city of london and are very concerned about that that i have spoken to that amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down i should like to ask him a question <e> <s> i listened very carefully to what he said and also to what the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes said <e> <s> however we are now in a different situation <e> <s> prior to <e>", "<cs> my lords first perhaps i may thank the noble lord lord campbell of alloway for his very welcome and extremely strong support for this amendment <e> <s> i was rather surprised that the minister either did not take the trouble or perhaps did not have the necessary material to answer the points that his noble friend made <e> <s> the noble lord took a slightly different approach from mine <e> <s> i must conclude that there is not a strong enough answer to this amendment that i have moved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry i thought the minister wanted to say something first <e> <s> if he is waiting for me to respond to that i am very grateful for what the noble lord has said and of course i would be extremely happy to respond <e> <s> what i am concerned about together with my colleagues is the subject matter and the substance of this it is not just a question of dividing the house <e> <s> i am really concerned that we should make some progress in this particular area <e> <s> it is not very often that the noble lord lord campbell and i are in agreement inside the chamber although we are very good friends outside the chamber <e> <s> i think this is something which the minister should consider quite seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for what he has said <e> <s> obviously until we have seen what is going to be put down i cannot say that what he has in mind would meet the case but it would certainly be moving towards agreement <e> <s> perhaps he would like to arrange a meeting with his noble friend lord campbell and myself to discuss this <e>", "<cs> i shall withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to delay the noble lord lord wigoder speaking but i had also spoken on the amendment and i think had asked for a little bit of flexibility <e> <s> i felt that in the absence of the noble lord lord tordoff and also on my own behalf i wanted to thank the minister for coming back with an amendment which is differently worded but which i think largely covers the point <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the minister will not think i am nit-picking but two points have occurred to me <e> <s> should this provision really be in clause at all <e> <s> clause has as its sideline chairman and vice-chairman and deals specifically with that matter <e> <s> if we are now to have a provision dealing with an executive a clerk to the authority should it not be a separate clause <e> <s> it is a different point <e> <s> one is an executive and the other is chairman and vice-chairman <e> <s> perhaps the minister will answer me on that point in a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not intend to intervene but what the noble baroness and the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter have said is not in line with the facts as they are <e> <s> first we are not talking about odd urban parks which belong to and are run by many of the boroughs <e> <s> we are talking about open spaces and green belt land which does not always respect borough boundaries <e> <s> a widespread city such as london is so built up that it is of tremendous importance to ensure that the land which we call green belt or open space is kept and is respected otherwise it will be encroached upon and there will be no rural surround to london at all <e> <s> everything will be built up <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that that was a hell of a long answer to a very simple and quite short amendment and introduction <e> <s> at one point the noble lord the minister rendered me almost speechless when he talked about fossilising the arrangements for archaeology <e> <s> if we are going to stay with archaeological metaphors i would say that i feel he is absolutely scraping the barrel in order to find reasons for refusing the amendment <e> <s> incidentally i did not move the amendment in committee <e> <s> it was my noble friend lady lockwood who unfortunately cannot be here this evening as her husband is unwell <e> <s> i have read very carefully everything that was said <e> <s> on that occasion the noble lord the minister carefully explained how wrong it was for this responsibility to go to the residuary body <e> <s> now he is talking about it going to the residuary body and suggesting all sorts of extraordinary motives behind this very simple amendment which suggests only that the districts should get together <e> <s> the noble lord lord montagu of beaulieu said in committee at cols <e> <s> of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister very much <e> <s> i have seen that amendment on the marshalled list it has been there for some days now <e> <s> i find it rather weak in structure but we are not discussing that at the moment <e> <s> i am disappointed that that is the answer but perhaps as we go along we can strengthen it <e> <s> however i do not think i shall get any further tonight so i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords briefly i support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord henderson <e> <s> he explained it very carefully in some detail so there is not much for me to say <e> <s> it is purely a question of arithmetic <e> <s> because of the way it is worked out as the noble lord explained the difference between the districts in the metropolitan counties and the boroughs in london means that there is an element of grave unfairness built into the system in the metropolitan counties which i cannot believe was intended by the government <e> <s> applying the same two-thirds rule makes it impossible to make the division come out correctly because although in <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we all remember very well the circumstances in which the minister announced the million <e> <s> it managed to head off a revolt against the government but i must point out that if the body that is the body which was the subject of the amendment which was defeated after the announcement of the million had been set up we should not have needed the amendments which have taken up a considerable time this afternoon and which have dealt with all kinds of aspects of the voluntary organisations because those aspects would have been covered by the original amendment <e> <s> however it would be quite wrong and churlish not to appreciate that there is some money now being given to the voluntary organisations and that it will be extended to the metropolitan counties as well as to london <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not really like doing this but the noble baroness arrived about halfway or <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect my remarks were addressed to the noble baroness in front of the noble lord <e> <s> the noble lord may rest peacefully <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that this is the second time round but i stress that the amendment is rather different this time and takes into account all the objections made by the minister <e> <s> the noble lord lord campbell of alloway referred to all the letters he had had from boroughs which were quite willing and able to do these repairs themselves <e> <s> there is nothing to stop them doing this <e> <s> our amendment does not stop the boroughs undertaking the renovations themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make sure that i am quite clear about it <e> <s> i appreciate the difficulty <e> <s> i also appreciate that the minister is going to a lot of trouble to try to get it as clear as possible <e> <s> it is very difficult <e> <s> is the minister suggesting that when he has moved his amendment amendment no <e> <s> cba the noble earl then moves his amendments and after that will there be a general debate <e> <s> will the noble baroness move the amendment in her name and the name of the noble lord lord plummer <e> <s> it seems to me they have to be discussed as alternatives <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e>", "<cs> my lords it is absolutely essential if this amendment is either to be carried or accepted by the minister that that should be a date <e> <s> this is a date only a month before abolition and the amendment of the noble earl says not later than so i imagine he would hope that some of these things would have got under way before that <e> <s> when i hear the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls saying that things may slip it makes me even more worried about what will happen by the time we get to abolition date <e>", "<cs> my lords having listened to what has been said and having read the amendments as carefully as i can i certainly support the noble earl and the noble lord lord tordoff because what the amendment is quite rightly doing is cutting down some of the discretion of the secretary of state and there is plenty of discretion still left as it is <e> <s> this is really quite otiose and is not only not necessary but makes the whole case much weaker <e> <s> i think that a very good <e>", "<cs> my lords the subsection states that the body shall make a report to the secretary of state who shall take it into consideration <e> <s> therefore he has this element of discretion in taking it into consideration <e> <s> it seems to me that this is what i would call a belt and braces job because in addition there are the words <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may interrupt the minister to ask him a question <e> <s> he says that it does not increase the secretary of states discretion but <e>", "<cs> my lords this is extremely complicated and makes things more difficult <e> <s> we are left a little in the air over what is to happen between the minister and the noble earl when they presumably get together over his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords yes the noble earl lord cranbrook <e> <s> i am speaking to the ministers amendment but as he has explained carefully taking in the comments made on it by the noble baroness lady faithfull <e> <s> i should like to take the ministers amendment which deals with an important subject and get it into perspective <e> <s> it is rather ironic but also refreshing that following a committee stage during <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this is the sort of thing that we should have discussed in committee <e> <s> it is so complicated that i do not think that we can just let it go like this <e> <s> in view of the great concern over the whole subject and the fact that it is quite late and there is a very thin house will the minister consider taking this back to look at it together with the amendment which has been spoken to but not moved by the noble baroness since it comes after the ministers amendment <e> <s> will he do this to see whether he could bring it more into line with the points which i shall not go over again because i outlined them quite fully where we feel that it is at a disadvantage compared with the other amendment which follows his and which causes part of the trouble <e> <s> i think that in the circumstances it would be a great help if he would do that because we are on to a very important subject very late at night and very late in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that they were contradictory <e>", "<cs> my lords there is nothing at all wounding about it <e> <s> there is a question of using the word correctly <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord glenarthur probably misunderstood what i said <e> <s> he had said that i thought ministers were inconsistent <e> <s> i said no i had not said that at all and i was being very kind to the ministers <e> <s> what i said was that they were entirely consistent in regard to themselves and their departments but contradicted the inconsistencies of other departments <e> <s> it was not wounding at all <e> <s> it was just a statement of fact which i think should be accepted and applauded <e> <s> i intervened only because i thought that we may have a little lighter exchange in the middle of the ministers very expert and extremely good answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first thank the minister for giving such a long and detailed explanation <e> <s> while i do not agree with the upshot of it it is important and useful to have on record exactly what is intended in this clause <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter naturally concentrated on the costs and on the dangers of the costs getting out of control <e> <s> i really must tell him that there are other means for dealing with the matter <e> <s> this is not entirely the purpose of the clause and in any case the government with their financial controls on local authorities and their use of rate capping can deal with that quite satisfactorily <e> <s> the question of costs even under the clause with the amendment would have to be taken into account by the local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has made great play of the fact that this is a very temporary measure that the whole scheme will last for only three years <e> <s> my concern is that the transitional period is of great importance given a cobbled-together bill of this kind and the very short length of time there will be between the moment when the bill goes on the statute book and everything comes into operation <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not altering the words which state that <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> all i am removing are the words <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the minister for taking trouble over this matter and writing to me in advance <e> <s> however having welcomed the amendment to the extent that it is an improvement on what is in the bill i am sorry to sound churlish but i cannot welcome it wholeheartedly <e> <s> it does not cover the point that i was making and the point that the noble lord lord campbell of alloway was making as i understand it from the <e>", "<cs> my lords of course that is so if the scheme is subject to the affirmative resolution <e> <s> nevertheless it is quite different from being able to question the secretary of state before the order is made <e> <s> the original amendment was much stronger <e> <s> as i said the amendment goes some of the way but it does not go far enough <e> <s> i appreciate what the noble lord lord campbell said sometimes one has to be thankful for small mercies <e> <s> we have often been in that position on the bill <e> <s> i do not intend to argue further about the amendment <e> <s> i am quite certain that n the circumstance the minister did his best <e>", "<cs> my lords i wanted to ask a question on that specific point <e> <s> the minister made a point about there not being a demand for a service <e> <s> in general one cannot find fault with his statement that one goes on and perhaps builds things and so on <e> <s> this is something different <e> <s> the noble lord is using that argument about demand <e> <s> research and information has become built into the county-wide system in local government and has spread its wings as i and my noble friend explained <e> <s> as this is so important can the minister give me the evidence that there is less demand for the type of research and information service that we are discussing <e> <s> i think that this is absolutely crucial to this whole question <e>", "<cs> my lords it was never my intention to press this amendment but i must say that the ministers reply makes me even more depressed than i was before <e> <s> i should very much like to be optimistic about this whole question but there is nothing in the bill that gives one any feeling of optimism <e> <s> in my intervention i asked the minister very specific questions about the evidence that there was less demand for this county-wide research and information service and obviously he could not say <e> <s> he just went back to saying that we should start all over again and build up a demand <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so i think the minister is making the most out of a really bad case <e> <s> we are not in any party political area we are in <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not keep the house for more than a few minutes <e> <s> i share the reservations expressed by the noble lord lord hayter and the noble baroness lady faithfull <e> <s> the government have recognised the drawbacks of the voluntary joint arrangements both for grants to voluntary organisations and for the research and collection of information but i certainly do not feel that this amendment takes the place of the sort of scheme that i put forward <e> <s> i think the same applies to clause covering the voluntary organisations <e> <s> the trouble is that it does not answer the fundamental objection that it is a permissive power only and that the district councils and boroughs may be unable or unwilling to agree to such schemes in time for payments to be made in because of the very short timetable for implementation <e> <s> i think that is the point which the noble baroness made that they slip out of the arrangements altogether <e> <s> it is important to realise that if the districts and boroughs do not agree to schemes there is no fall-back mechanism to protect the countywide and trans-district voluntary bodies for the transitional period <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i think that this must be said again <e> <s> the amendment goes down the right road of realising that there is a need to co-ordinate services but the provision is still weak <e> <s> it does not place a firm duty on the district councils or boroughs to investigate all opportunities for joint working arrangements as well as the incidental provision of services and goods <e> <s> local authorities have power to provide each other with services under the local authorities goods and services act <e> <s> that power is mainly used by one authority to buy in a little-used service from another which needs to provide it on a larger scale and payment is normally on a reimbursement basis at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise only to say that it is pleasant on this the last amendment to say that i have no objection to it whatsoever <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord the minister asked whether we on this side would accept that <e> <s> yes we accept it and we will accept the first amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the amendment standing in the name of the noble baroness lady stedman and myself <e> <s> later i shall come to another amendment which is quite different and that stands in my name and is supported by the noble baroness <e> <s> in doing that i should like to give a small <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the confusion is that amendment no <e> <s> is really in the group with no <e> <s> but i do not think that that matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply i think that is the courteous thing to say but i cannot say that he has convinced me in the slightest degree nor has the noble lord lord sandford <e> <s> i was not under any impression that the guidance was going to be in extreme detail but even in its broad brush attempt it would still be special guidance for london coming from the secretary of state rather than regional guidance <e> <s> there would then be the joint committee giving the guidance as mentioned in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords in the absence of my noble friend perhaps i may say that we are delighted to see that the government have honoured their word and tabled the amendment but i still have to say that it does not go far enough <e> <s> it does not alter the substantive content of the clause which will force ilea which will be a directly elected education authority to consult authorities with no specific educational responsibilities on its budget and policy objectives <e> <s> no other education authority is subject to such consultation and constraint <e> <s> as has been said before we consider that the whole clause is unnecessary <e> <s> however half or even quarter of a loaf is better than none and we welcome the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that rather negative reply <e> <s> on this amendment i was as was the noble lord lord henderson of brompton very much impressed by the speech of the noble baroness lady faithfull <e> <s> it is obviously difficult and i appreciate her dilemma when one is arguing even in the gracious and charming way she does against ones own government <e> <s> one has to feel very strongly about something to do that <e> <s> she also speaks from a vast experience and what she said about realism having to be mixed with idealism is absolutely right <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister very much for underlining and clarifying what i thought he meant <e> <s> that is what amendment no <e> <s> says but what it does is to spell out the services <e> <s> it was clear from the questions put to the minister that people were not satisfied about having a general statement on archives but picking out the particular services if there had been anybody here who wanted to talk about libraries or other services such as financial and personnel services <e> <s> profession is a much wider word than technical i know the minister said that was stretching it to breaking point <e> <s> i shall not argue about administrative although i should be prepared to say that administrative would come within the confines of professionalism because administrators are professional people <e> <s> i do not think that i can accept that point either <e>", "<cs> my lords what on earth does one say about a bill such as this <e> <s> it is more than a bill <e> <s> it has become almost a way of life for many of us <e> <s> we seem to have lived here on this bill for a great length of time now <e> <s> it is however nice to be able to say something nice about it <e> <s> that is really about the minister not about the bill <e> <s> the noble lord lord elton has really done a quite remarkable job <e> <s> he was thrown in at the deep end and came to environment to deal with something like this and did so with great confidence and extremely good humour and patience <e> <s> he has always been very quick to his feet with the right words to say well right from his point of view <e> <s> he always put it over extremely well and was always courteous to everyone <e>", "<cs> my lords since as the noble lord has pointed out stonehenge belongs to the secretary of state for the environment but is being managed by the commission can he assure the house that in the consultations which will take place with the commission on future measures to be taken what will be borne very much in mind is the need for people who genuinely wish to see the monument to be able to do so without exciting a total ban on it <e> <s> further will the department probably in conjunction with the home office go into the whole matter of the type depth and manner of the police action taken during the holding of the festivals <e>", "<cs> my lords may i from this side of the house say how pleased we are that the other place accepted the amendments which had all-party support in this house <e> <s> may i also say that as i understand it my chief whip is very pleased to support what i have said <e> <s> we are at least starting off on a happy note <e> <s> it will probably deteriorate very quickly but nevertheless it is a good start <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the motion moved in the name of the noble lord lord ezra <e> <s> i think i must start by saying that we are considering now something entirely different from the motion we have just considered on highways and transport <e> <s> they are both very important motions but i think it is only fair to view them entirely differently and to look at the reasons why we believe that these amendments that were made by your lordships should be insisted on <e>", "<cs> my lords if wages councils are being abolished for the under-s does that mean that there will be no minimum wage <e> <s> if so how will that prevent wages dropping below the level of unemployment benefit and then supplementary benefit to which the young people would be entitled if not in work <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord not aware of his governments own green paper on this subject published on th may which encourages the repair and improvement of housing <e> <s> is he further aware that in that green paper there are proposals for redefining repair so that disrepair means dangerous structural disrepair and damp is defined as dampness so pervasive as to be a threat to the health of the occupant <e> <s> does this not mean a great lowering of standards <e> <s> perhaps the minister can tell the house how many houses now classified as unfit would under the new proposals be reclassified as fit <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to come back on this matter but the noble lord has still not answered the point that these redefinitions were proposed and put down in the governments own green paper <e> <s> is the noble lord saying that there is no redefinition intended or if there is redefinition intended is he also then prepared to agree that this will lower the standards considerably and mean that there will be more and more housing in a lamentably poorer condition even than there is at the present time which is making it as low as it can be <e>", "<cs> my lords in making some response to the statement i must point out although i am sure that it is no fault of the minister here that i did not receive a copy of the statement until much later than usual <e> <s> it is a very difficult one <e> <s> i have also not had a chance as he will appreciate to go through the consultation paper <e> <s> i shall of course give a qualified welcome to doing away with targets but i certainly take issue with the noble lord about this being a very much simpler way of putting things <e> <s> i find it just as complicated as these statements always have been and no doubt always will be <e> <s> one just changes one bit of gobbledegook for another but it does not make things any clearer especially for those who prefer to speak simple plain english <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister consider that it would be more sensible not to consider stud farming apart from the agricultural industry with which it has much in common <e> <s> is not this something which should be being considered by his right honourable friend in his study on local government finance <e>", "<cs> my lords may ithank the minister for reading the statement which was made by the minister for the arts in another place <e> <s> i shall begin by saying that the one thing i can welcome and i am sure the arts council do as well is that there has been an early announcement of the governments intentions <e> <s> having said that i think that the rest of the statement is really extremely disappointing <e> <s> the increase in the base budget barely covers the rate of inflation at or around per cent <e> <s> what it really means is an increase and i am talking now about the base budget of million on the million the arts council had last year <e> <s> so in fact there has been a real cut in their base budget <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to have to speak again and to hold up the debate but i cannot leave the answer that the noble lord gave about the contribution by local authorities <e> <s> it is not a case in most instances of whether they choose to support the arts it is whether they are able to do so <e> <s> when a local authority is faced with having to make provision for old people for recreational facilities for young people or for any of the myriad of things on which they are pressed to make choices and decide priorities it is inevitable unfortunately that the arts have to be pushed down lower in the list however much the local authority may dislike having to do that <e> <s> will the noble lord not agree that at a time of very high unemployment and disturbances in the inner cities the quality of life for people needs to be encouraged and improved <e> <s> it is not the time to make cuts <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister assure the house that sufficient government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i interrupted the application for one of the jobs by the noble lord lord somers <e> <s> can the minister assure the house that sufficient government money will be made available for the new south bank entrepreneurial programming <e> <s> that will evidently have to include the salaries of the general directors for arts and administration and the nine senior directors referred to by the noble lord lord somers which is in excess of what was spent by the glc <e> <s> noble lords opposite thought that was highly extravagant <e> <s> can this be done without transferring resources away from the regions and other london arts bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may press the noble lord the minister a little further on his reply to me that it was a matter for the arts council to decide how the money was allocated <e> <s> the arts council was given in its total budget the amount of million to compensate for the shortfall which would be suffered over the abolition of the glc and the metropolitan counties <e> <s> is the noble lord the minister aware that the arts council had asked for million <e> <s> is it not quite a coincidence that the difference between the million and the million is almost equivalent to the sum for which the south bank board is asking to run the south bank <e> <s> that figure is about million <e> <s> therefore will the minister not have to agree that if the arts council gives the south bank board what it wants then other bodies all over the country must suffer <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that although business sponsorship is very welcome it leads to rather random benefit largely to prestigious bodies which is very understandable <e> <s> can he therefore assure the house that the government will not use industrial patronage as a substitute for a more generous arts budget which is essential if young talent is to be nurtured experimental work undertaken and the less immediately popular art forms supported since all these are vital if we are to maintain our unique leading position in the international field <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the longer the work on the victoria tower is delayed the more it will cost and that it will probably be put off again and again <e> <s> he said that the ceiling in the peers lobby had been made secure but is he aware he must be that the ceiling has been scaffolded for a considerable time <e> <s> will he confirm that it is not envisaged that funds will be made available in for its restoration and the completion of that work <e> <s> is this not extraordinarily unsatisfactory <e> <s> will the minister urge his right honourable friend to make funds available in for work in a very central part of the palace of westminster that is very much used by both houses <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case will the minister please make it known not only to myself but to the house whether this is not as i understand it envisaged to be budgeted for in <e> <s> this is of the greatest importance as we are only at the beginning of <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that i have some sympathy for him in answering this rather difficult question as i feel that he is rather more aggy than arty <e> <s> nevertheless what he has said about the arts council must be pressed further <e> <s> is he aware that the arts council has cut its funding for the reasons that he has mentioned and that which the bta was getting from the glc stops after abolition <e> <s> can he give any indication of whether the bta will not be receiving some of the million which the arts council was given as replacement money following abolition <e> <s> will he not agree that the which we are delighted to hear that the des will continue to give the bta is really quite inadequate and that the office of arts and libraries is surely the body to make a grant to this association the value of which has already been mentioned by other noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to have to come back but the minister mentioned the question of contributions from local authorities <e> <s> i must put this to him <e> <s> is it not true that the association is a national one and that it is extremely difficult to ask or expect local authorities with all the other demands on them to contribute to that <e> <s> is the noble lord also aware that the british theatre association has written to the richmond scheme for that very purpose but has not surprisingly received no response <e> <s> in these circumstances will the noble lord agree that this must be treated as a national matter and bearing in mind that the acting profession has about the highest unemployment of almost any other profession that the chances of getting more contributions and even sponsorship are very low compared with other activities <e>", "<cs> my lords i start by thanking the minister for his clear explanation and description of the bill <e> <s> we were also pleased to see that two minor amendments were accepted by the government in another place one which is in the bill while the other on the reporting of the findings on the archaeological service and on what the museum has been doing will be moved in committee here <e> <s> so far so good <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that that is now a statutory function <e> <s> i gained the impression that the minister may have thought that there could be a number of other institutions or museums that should be included if one included the passmore-edwards but that is not so <e> <s> just the two museums are responsible for rescue archaeology in london as i said one with the five and the other with the <e> <s> i should like him to bear that very much in mind when he is considering the point <e> <s> it is a simple drafting point but very important archaeologically <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that while providing means to encourage business sponsorship which the minister has mentioned the governments own inadequate arts subsidy discourages a climate of comprehensive support for the arts <e> <s> without larger sums from the public sector being made available the arts will continue to retain their low priority and remain susceptible to the whims of patronage instead of developing their huge revenue earnings and employment potential which they are unable to do at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords on that point is the minister not aware that the arts councils estimate was for million to make up for the effects of abolition and that in fact they have got million so that for starters they are million short <e>", "<cs> my lords even with the amount that has been given by the arts

to repay the residuary body which is replacing the glc the sum of which has already been spent on building the new studio and that if this comes about it will bring sadlers wells to irretrievable ruin <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply which indicates that some action is being taken <e>

perhaps in this case even more important the heritage will suffer unless there is very tight and strict control <e> <s> the matter is i submit one of great urgency <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that it is not with any pleasure that i raise this question <e> <s> it is with great concern <e> <s> is it not the case that however good the commission are in many of their activities with

minister in comparing their position now with when they were in the department where as he knows very well the controls are very strict indeed <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to everyone who has taken part in this debate and particularly my noble friend lord jenkins and the noble lord lord donaldson <e> <s> the noble lord lord donaldson has made the point first that we have two past arts

will write to me about the matter before report stage <e> <s> i say that because the point comes into the area where the minister responsible is in the department of the environment and the minister responsible for the arts in this house is answering now <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister very much for that reply <e> <s> i am aware that the commission will get something like an extra million for the next financial year to take care of post-abolition activities <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but with great respect i simply must reply because i think that the noble lord is wrong to make a comment like that <e> <s> i was not referring to newspaper reports on my basic point <e> <s> i was referring to the answer given by the minister from the department of the environment to my question last wednesday when he said <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the minister for moving this clause <e> <s> it is a very useful one which as i understand it arose out of something that was originally put forward by my

it <e>", "<cs> my lords having listened to all the speakers in this interesting debate it is clear to me that we are not just discussing finance or even basically whether there should be voluntary

the museum of london but a number of archaeologists are very concerned about this including the association of rescue archaeology <e> <s> rather than having to look up the relevant reference in <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords how does the minister reconcile that reply with the statement made by the arts minister on th november in another place and repeated in this house in which he stated when <e>", "<cs> my lords then i must ask the minister what are the reasons for talking about putting in an order at this moment when the million has been agreed and accepted and the draft order that has been sent out as the minister knows does not make any provision for a review but provides for million irrespective of inflation or increased needs just to continue until another order is put forward <e> <s> what are the reasons for that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the noble lord for that reply i should like to ask him whether there has been any contraction in the other projects of the other divisions for instance in historic buildings or archaeology <e> <s> the noble lord in his reply said that the excess expenditure in the marketing division was million which represents a per cent <e> <s> increase over the original budget for that division <e> <s> i should like to know who authorised this <e> <s> who was responsible for controlling it <e> <s> are those who were responsible for it still with the commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to press the minister but the situation really is not satisfactory <e> <s> the noble lord has not answered the question which i put to him about who authorised this and who was responsible for this expenditure which the noble lord described in his written answer on st april at

is being carried out <e> <s> however is it not the case that bookspace has been operating for only a few months has been very successful and is the one way of bringing literature and books together in

continuity will not be broken <e> <s> is he aware that the year i have heard mentioned is <e> <s> it would be a great pity if nothing were done about books or literary events until then <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but i should like to take up the point about the poetry library <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned that the poetry library will be accommodated on the south bank <e> <s> is it not the case that it has been offered the waterloo room which it believes quite rightly is extremely inaccessible that people just passing through that area will not visit it and

perfectly in order to bring a bill on this subject at any time that he wants <e> <s> the noble lord although he may have been in order was quite wrong in spirit and sentiment in what he said <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will give way <e> <s> the point at which the proceedings came to an end was when all the debate had taken place and the question had been put for a division to take place <e> <s> surely in view of what has now been said both by the noble lord and the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale it should now be for the noble lord to have the question put as the chairman suggested as one of the alternatives <e> <s> we all have <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i can get a word in here <e> <s> i was hoping to speak before the minister but he jumped up <e> <s> first

that or have other things which would attract people like throwing coins in a fountain making it an attractive proposition to contribute to the museum <e> <s> this does not mean that this is different from the charges <e> <s> from what my noble friend has said already i think he would be prepared to amend the bill himself or accept a reasonable amendment but not on the lines of some of the amendments that have been put down <e>", "<cs> it is a private members bill <e> <s> the party policy is against charges but not against voluntary donations <e> <s> i do not agree with some parts of my noble friends bill and he knows that as well as i do <e> <s> nevertheless the question of contributions and donations is something which i certainly support and from what he has himself said this

or disagree <e> <s> so far as i know that has not been worked out in detail yet <e> <s> my own view is and i stand by my view to go along with the donations <e> <s> but that is not what the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls was trying to do when he moved the amendment <e> <s> he <e>", "<cs> no i am sorry what i said was that i am in favour of voluntary donations <e> <s> i did not discuss anybody else

for government money to match business contributions is now running out <e> <s> will the minister give assurances that money will not be taken out of the direct public arts budget and that his right honourable friend will ask the treasury for additional money for this particular scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true however that as i said the success of the scheme has meant that funds are running out and by october the present amount will probably be exhausted <e> <s> therefore will not his right honourable friend then be in a dilemma <e> <s> he can either boost this scheme by taking money from directs arts funding about which we should all be very upset or he can go to the treasury to ask for a special addition for this scheme <e> <s> i should like an answer to that question <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the labour party has made clear that it considers that this is absolutely undesirable censorship by the libraries <e> <s> is it not the case that under section of the act two library advisory councils one for england and one for wales were set up to advise the secretary of state on matters concerned with library facilities and that the one for england was later named the library and information services council <e> <s> is not part of that councils terms of reference now to provide guidance advice and comment on library and information matters for the providers and users of the relevant service to promote consultation and co-operation and to cover the whole field where anything of this sort arises <e> <s> has the council been brought into play on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords may i come back on this <e> <s> i put a question to the minister to which his reply was that he was not aware of the point <e> <s> since the body to which i referred was established it has been staffed i understand by volunteers from the office of arts and libraries <e> <s> is he aware that there is a feeling that a more independent body might be of greater use in matters such as this <e> <s> is he aware that the terms of reference include advising the minister for the arts on matters that fall directly within his sphere of responsibility for library and information affairs <e> <s> if the minister does not have the answer available now will he inquire as to whether action is being taken through a body set up under the act <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that these two companies enjoy unique national and international prestige and also earn a great deal financially for britain <e> <s> is it not because they are so successful and a great deal of the credit for that success must go to their artistic directors that this matter has arisen <e> <s> if there are guidelines produced then it will be a result of their successes <e> <s> can the minister reassure us that if this controversy is used to attack government investment in the arts ministers will resist this action rigorously and loudly <e>", "<cs> my lords i was pleased to hear the ministers intervention because although as my noble friend lord mishcon pointed out once again this evening we are unhappy about criminal trespass being included in the bill if it is to be in and it appears definitively to be so it would seem to me as someone who had considerable experience of looking after the heritage as a minister in the labour government that <e>", "<cs> my lords while we on these benches have made it quite clear throughout the passage of the bill that we do not like criminal trespass to be included in it it now appears beyond doubt at this stage that it will remain in the bill <e> <s> in this case it would be quite wrong if while agricultural buildings are to be given protection scheduled monuments are left to take their chance against vandalism and all the other things which can occur to this very fragile part of our heritage <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that the building will not be vacated and can be used until march <e> <s> would it not make economic and artistic sense for those rooms to be used during the interregnum as concert rehearsals rooms of which the south bank is short or for the national theatre or for the exhibitions that the glc promoted which london misses as it does its tremendous support for the arts <e> <s> will the minister tell us what can be done in the interregnum <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all extremely grateful to the noble lord lord fanshawe for raising <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i put one point to him <e> <s> he said several times that the government were awaiting the report of the working party <e> <s> that worries me a little <e> <s> the effect of this directive going through if it does is much wider than concerns just the fine arts dealers in london <e>", "<cs> my lords seldom if ever have so many speakers spoken in a mini-debate in this house <e> <s> the breadth of concern which flows from the smallest organisations to the largest from london to the regions from theatre opera music dance films and video from the visual arts to museums and galleries which we have heard from all sides of the house today is obviously a reaction to next years budget which was announced at a most propitious time for this debate <e> <s> also since the government have broken what was an all-party consensus which ensured an increase in the arts councils budget in real terms every year <e> <s> like my noble friend lord donoughue who made an excellent speech in introducing his motion i do not propose to go into percentages <e> <s> there was an annual increase and the arts budget of last labour government in which i had the honour to be a <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has put forward the legislative case very clearly and several times has stressed that this is a very modest measure <e> <s> it is not as modest as all that because the implications of this bill are very large and wide-ranging <e> <s> the noble lord referred to the debate on the peacock committees report which is due to take place in this house later this month <e> <s> that of course will be an in-the-round debate and i should have thought would <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself somewhat in the uncomfortable position of not having any interest to declare except that of a viewer and a sometime participant in programmes <e> <s> perhaps it is only fair to say that i was connected for many years in one way by marriage some years ago <e> <s> what this debate has shown and what the peacock committee report indicated right away when it was published was that the original scenario that the peacock committee would recommend advertising on the bbc backfired <e> <s> here i am absolutely at one with the noble lord lord bonham-carter because they came up with the wrong answer and from there i think everything else has flowed <e> <s> it fell down on the economic side <e> <s> otherwise i think that we would be faced today with the recommendations for advertising to be introduced in the bbc <e>", "<cs> my lords if this happens which i very much hope and if the tenor of this debate has any influence it will not the fourth channel will no longer be channel <e> <s> it will be a fourth channel limping along and trying to keep up and compete with the other itv companies <e> <s> as has been pointed out the companies have been quite open about what they would do <e> <s> as one managing director of one of the commercial companies said to me we would all schedule aggressively against channel if it was on its own <e> <s> one does not have to be brilliant to see that this must result in a deterioration in the standards <e> <s> the auctioning of companies again has been discussed by many noble lords <e> <s> what worries me tremendously is how a committee with all the talent of the peacock committee although it appeared to be done rather rapidly could come up with a suggestion such as that without realising the dangers that could result <e> <s> i apologise to the house but i must stress although it has been stressed by many the problem for the iba if it does not accept the highest offer how it would then have to justify itself and how difficult it might be to do so <e> <s> again there is a change in the relationship i am sorry to be looking at the noble lord lord quinton all the time while i am saying this because he is a good friend but he is the only representative of the committee here so i have to address my remarks to him as he also spoke in the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure what point the noble earl is making <e> <s> the point i was making when i was saying why i thought television in this country is good was that it is because it is a combination of the public service and the commercial stations as well <e> <s> i was trying to get away from using the one phrase public service <e> <s> it was in answer to something the noble baroness lady warnock said so i do not see how the quotation pleasant as it sounded really helped <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister also take into account my other point <e> <s> i asked whether people could really opt out of it or whether once it is there they will have to pay and have a subscription gadget when they buy a new television <e> <s> that is what i wanted to know <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not like to keep jumping up and interrupting the minister but that is grossly unfair <e> <s> what i was doing was pointing out the advantages of the present system why it is as it is and making comments very similar though it was difficult to find different words to use to what earlier speakers said from the cross-benches and from the benches opposite <e> <s> it is not at all a negative attitude <e> <s> if the minister will read <e>", "<cs> at the very beginning when i introduced the amendment i thought i had made it clear that it was a probing amendment <e> <s> i can put at rest the mind of the noble lord lord aylestone because i shall not be pressing it to a division <e> <s> i was quite rightly using the amendment as a means of raising the concern that i felt about the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that bbc local radio has a high speech

minister agree that we need this wide range of local radio stations <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his remarks <e> <s> nevertheless in the light of the issues arising in this bill i am not yet convinced that the extension of the franchises was necessary <e> <s> i am also extremely disappointed that the whole question of a green paper on television which the noble lord received with enthusiasm at committee stage has not been accepted <e> <s> it seems to me a simple modest and sensible idea <e>", "<cs> my lords i noticed that the minister said that the government favour the council of europe convention rather than the ec draft directive <e> <s> how do they intend to protect the high proportion of british-made programmes which i think runs at per cent <e> <s> in the light of the fact that even the convention would drastically reduce our <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first thank the minister for her kind remarks <e> <s> is she aware that although i was appointed by a labour secretary of state my term as chairman was extended by a conservative secretary of state and that both of them recognised the great advantage of being advised by an independent body even if sometimes it was uncomfortable for them <e> <s> such a body can run campaigns of considerable impact such as the pregnant man poster of years ago which understandably a government department would not be able to do <e> <s> the same applies to the aids campaigns today <e> <s> can the minister tell me whether the new authority will have the freedom to commission and publish research on controversial subjects irrespective of whether they are in sir brian baileys words political dynamite <e> <s> will it also be able to initiate controversial publicity campaigns without feeling a heavy departmental hand on its shoulder <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for explaining the order <e> <s> i confess right away that having examined it vertically horizontally upside down backwards and forwards

the problems attached to finding sufficient funds to get dbs off the ground have they given themselves enough time <e> <s> it is not that i am asking for an extension but i wonder whether dbs will become viable in the early s as the government seem optimistically to think <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord forgive my interrupting <e> <s> before he leaves the question of the green paper on television i thank him for what he has said <e> <s> i accept what he has put forward <e> <s> one point puzzles me i think that i heard it correctly <e> <s> the noble lord talked about there having been consultation <e> <s> i do not quite know what he means <e> <s> there has not been consultation <e> <s> there has been a large report by the peacock committee <e> <s> and so far that is it <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister was answering the question on underspend to the best of his ability <e> <s> but does he accept that it is rather worrying <e> <s> even if english heritage can carry over a certain amount is there not the possibility given considerable underspend that its budget could be cut next year <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> is it not the case that on th june during the passage of the abolition bill the then minister lord elton said that he expected to come to a solution before abolition day <e> <s> then on th october he announced an invitation to the city of london to take over the heath <e> <s> this decision was deferred to consider an offer by camden and the heath then passed to the london residuary body which as the minister said has been consulting for some considerable time now <e> <s> does this not show how difficult it is to find a solution satisfactory to all in the absence of a london-wide body <e>", "<cs> my lords since the minister mentioned as we are all aware that the consultation period is being extended may i ask how soon after the end of that consultation period the residuary body will be making recommendations and when we will finally have a decision from the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the london scientific services are both responsible for the day-to-day needs of the different successor bodies and also for the strategic planning of londons needs <e> <s> how can

an end and i hope that we shall have an opportunity to debate the green paper in this house <e> <s> but can the noble lord give us some idea of how a greatly extended system as proposed in the green paper which covers national local and community stations will be financed in practice <e> <s> this is not covered it is just glanced at in the green paper and there is considerable worry about the financing of these new proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords like the other speakers in this short debate i too am grateful to the noble viscount lord torrington for giving us a stab at this subject tonight <e> <s> i found it rather ironic that the moment it was announced that the debate would he televised the covers were immediately put on the cameras though i think that it was the lateness of the hour rather than any particular prejudice that led to that <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in its most recent report the house of commons environment committee unanimously recommended that the owners of listed buildings should be relieved of the burden of per cent <e> <s> vat on repairs and maintenance by allowing them to recover it through the taxation system <e> <s> i repeat that it was the committees unanimous recommendation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware as i am sure he is that <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that a general election is a special event of great importance in a democracy and that public service broadcasters regard it as their duty to provide adequate coverage <e> <s> is he also aware that the bbc scrupulously scheduled its programmes

minister whether he is aware that on nd august my right honourable friend the then secretary of state for the environment announced that the government had decided to go ahead with plans prepared by william whitfield the consultant architect for restoration of the fine interiors of richmond terrace to make the most effective use of an attractive listed building and to preserve the existing character and appearance of whitehall at a cost of million <e> <s> why then have only five of the fine rooms that were put in store been reinstated against the advice of the consultant architect <e>

are debating whether they fulfilled their statutory responsibilities in the period leading up to the general election which is really a different question <e> <s> as has been pointed out by the noble lord lord annan the debate has gone all over the place <e> <s> some noble lords have kept to the aspect of the general election while others have talked about broadcasting in general terms <e> <s>

generous terms about the bbc than the noble lord from the cross-benches <e> <s> the noble lord lord chalfont appears to be to the right of the noble lord lord thorneycroft <e>", "<cs> my lords the remarks that the noble lord lord chalfont made appeared in an article that he wrote on i believe th june published in the <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord should allow me to finish the sentence <e> <s> i was about to say that what has worried me is that he and other noble lords in this debate have quoted themselves as being quite impartial viewers and listeners <e> <s> in fact the noble lord lord maude of stratford-upon-avon i felt was taking a better line when he admitted that these perceptions were subjective and went on to say that he was an impartial viewer and listener <e>

valuation of constables flatford mill which was accepted in lieu for million <e> <s> it is responsible for providing the minister with expert advice <e> <s> that sum of million was over double the price of any other picture by constable and is considered by experts in the art world to be way above its current market value <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister mentioned the van gogh that was sold a little later <e> <s> will he accept that the valuations and prices of different artists vary absolutely enormously and that my question dealt with the constable <e> <s> that painting was taken in lieu at a price far above not only that for any other constable but for any british artist <e> <s> is this not a dangerous precedent and will the minister for the arts make sure that the board of the museums and galleries commission is not bypassed in this way in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept the fact that we on these benches welcome the statement <e> <s> we are delighted that the statue is to be erected <e> <s> will the government make sure that maintenance is sustained <e> <s> that is extremely important <e>", "<cs> we on these benches support the amendment <e> <s> i have had something to do with the work of teaching film-making as a governor of the british film institute for many years and chairman of its education committee <e>", "<cs> i raise a point on the wording of subsection of this clause <e> <s> unless it is redrafted so that copyright and so on is not infringed by being copied or by adaptation of it it appears that there will be no exemptions in respect of adaptations <e> <s> such an exemption exists under the copyright act and it is difficult to see why the present exemption is more restrictive <e> <s> rather than draft an amendment to this i have raised this query in clause stand part to elicit a reply from the minister <e> <s> i should also like to know whether this clause covers the open university because there is no reference to it <e>", "<cs> i and my colleagues support what my noble friend lord peston has just said <e> <s> it is essential to clarify the matter because as my noble friend pointed out it is not clear how educational establishment will extend to educational institutions other than schools <e> <s> even if the secretary of state wants to designate other establishments it is doubtful whether he has the power <e> <s> i am going on what is in the bill <e>", "<cs> i shall read what the minister has said think about it and perhaps come back to the matter at another stage with a more precise amendment not so wide as this one but at least extending the present clause <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will do that because as my noble friend so rightly put it at the same moment that i was about to get up and make the same point the bill is quite specific about that <e> <s> the minister may be being generous and kindly in saying that he does not think it would count but that is not what the bill says <e> <s> the bill does not mention an exclusion for parents who may pop in for another reason or not realise that there is a performance going on <e> <s> the bill does not say any such thing <e> <s> that is how the position stands at the moment <e> <s> i am arguing that what we should look at is whether in these cases it should be considered a private rather than a public performance <e> <s> that is all <e> <s> that would cover teachers pupils and close relatives <e> <s> as i tried to explain it would not really be of interest to anybody else <e>", "<cs> in the circumstances i shall withdraw the amendment and think about it <e> <s> however i hope that the government will have something to say on the matter at the next stage <e>", "<cs> i think my noble friend was absolutely in order on his point concerning educational establishments <e> <s> he had obviously listened carefully to the debate we had earlier as far as the bill is concerned an educational establishment is a school <e> <s> however when we are talking about photocopying we are thinking in terms of institutions and establishments of higher education as well <e>", "<cs> yes we are <e> <s> one of the practical effects of the amendment is having regard to the fact that spending by students on books has declined by per cent <e> <s> over the last years that the problems and the expense of paying for photocopying are going to mount tremendously and it will be even more expensive in the future <e>", "<cs> it is with trepidation that i point out to the noble and learned lord that as i <e>", "<cs> i have not really been convinced by any of the arguments which have been deployed against this amendment <e> <s> first the minister himself had to admit that he was not sure whether a signature on a picture or a title on a book was in itself an assertion <e> <s> i should have said from reading clause that he was right <e> <s> it is not necessarily so <e> <s> so this means an entirely new and different act <e> <s> my noble friend asked how that would be carried out but we seem rather to be left in the air over that <e>", "<cs> i am not very happy with the amendment <e> <s> i do not wish to cross swords with the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> however i should be happy to see people such as gropius and many other architects being allowed to have their names on houses <e> <s> i agree that many houses are built by architects who one hopes will feel so ashamed when they see the results of their work that they will not want to put their names on them <e> <s> however i think that is a great pity to leave private houses out because there could be quite exceptional pieces of architecture which are built as private houses <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will think again <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend pointed out clause seems to add very largely to the confusion <e> <s> there is no doubt that this clause even with the governments intention behind it is certainly far from clear <e> <s> it still does not give any practical information on assertion <e> <s> subsection states <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord lloyd has almost convinced me but i shall read in <e>", "<cs> it was for information and in order to make that point that i moved the amendment <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> should any more information come my way between now and the next stage of the bill i may reinstate the matter in another form <e>", "<cs> very briefly i would very much like to support what my noble friend lord morton of shuna had to say and also what the minister said <e> <s> i do not always agree with him but on this occasion i thought he made out a first-class case for what is an absolutely first-class point <e> <s> i am a paid-up member of the nuj and used to do a lot more journalism than i do now <e> <s> i have always had a contract in one form or another even as a freelance <e> <s> when you are freelancing fairly regularly you can have a contract for that <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> we feel that it should be a matter of consent and should always be in writing <e> <s> we are not happy about <e>", "<cs> on behalf of my noble friend i support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord willis and supported by the noble lord lord graham and the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that we are taking these amendments together <e> <s> i shall therefore speak to amendment no <e> <s> in the name of the noble lord lord morton of shuna and myself which seeks to <e>", "<cs> my lords with the exception of the stalwart support from my noble friend lord graham of edmonton there does not seem to have been all that much joy expressed on this amendment <e> <s> i must confess that i think that one of the reasons for that is that this is something new which both breaks new <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know what the minister has received <e> <s> however i received represent-ations some time ago as a governor of the british film institute <e> <s> we are attempting to introduce directors jointly rather than suggesting that they take over the kudos rights or established rewards of authors <e> <s> so far as concerns the producers it remains open to them as i said in moving the amendment to take an assignment of that interest and they may do so in advance of the making of the film <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what the noble baroness has said i am glad to hear the minister supporting the lending of works of art and travelling exhibitions <e> <s> can he say whether the government still intend to legislate to empower trustees of the national gallery the tate and the national portrait gallery to sell pictures from their collections <e> <s> is he aware that the trustees who are the present guardians of these collections are opposed to any selling off and that it would also be a betrayal of the generosity of donors who either have made financial contributions or have given actual works of art <e> <s> these gifts will dwindle to a trickle if a policy of selling off is imposed <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said that this was a work of fiction <e> <s> does he not agree that there are other works of fiction this was a drama which refer to all sorts of groups of people within the population <e> <s> nobody believes that such a production has any connection with reality at all and therefore it should be treated in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords following on what has already been said i believe that an early agreement must be reached between the city of london and archaeologists that the remains which are acknowledged by all sides to be of immense importance will be preserved <e> <s> will the government ensure that there is wide and open discussion to forestall the building over of the three sites involved even though recording may have taken place <e> <s> there is a difference between obtaining the records and having the sites preserved so that people can see them in an interpretative centre <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the pictures given by donors will probably be excluded in the legislation <e> <s> will the government also exclude all those pictures now in the three galleries to which members of the public including children have contributed with donations ranging from large to very small for example the two paintings by stubbs the haymakers and the reapers and also constables the opening of waterloo bridge <e> <s> if the government intend to exclude those which they should what is the point of bringing forward this very bad legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords like everyone who has spoken thus far on this bill i naturally accept that proper radio communication for londons fire service is absolutely essential <e> <s> however i think we all appreciate that that factor is not in doubt <e> <s> indeed my noble friend lady phillips who quite rightly said that this could be a very emotional matter did not rely on emotion when she made her proposal <e>", "<cs> i beg the noble baronesss pardon <e> <s> that is right but the same point applies <e> <s> the instruction is necessary or the bill would be sent on without any comments about what took place on second reading in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add my congratulations to the noble baroness <e> <s> i hope that she will fight as stalwartly in the interests of the arts as she does as regards all her other responsibilities <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall go back to how the bbc started with its charter and licence <e> <s> the charter and the licence provide a remarkable degree of freedom to the bbc and its governors to do what they think best in the interests of broadcasting and to act in a phrase first employed in as trustees of the public interest <e> <s> the charter contains almost nothing about the making of programmes <e> <s> the licence and agreement say little more <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not give way because we are having a timed debate <e> <s> perhaps the noble baroness and i could have a word afterwards <e>", "<cs> in that case i think i had better speak to my amendment which is an entirely different animal altogether <e> <s> it is amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> one of the reasons that i consider it to be quite different is that it takes two words that are in the bill and asks for a slight substitution <e> <s> it does not bring in new subjects or areas <e> <s> in fact it is unfortunate that the amendments are linked in this way <e> <s> however i am sure the minister will deal with them all separately <e> <s> i do not envy her in that task but we seem to have got into what i would call an unfortunate mix-up <e> <s> the amendment in my name and the names of three other noble lords is at least short and simple <e> <s> it replaces music art with the arts <e> <s> of course i was delighted to find the word art in the bill <e> <s> naming only music and art and art in this context i imagine is generally understood to mean fine art or visual art by definition excludes drama dance design film tv and other aspects of the media <e>", "<cs> i have just one point to put to the minister <e> <s> the arguments which she used against accepting the amendment were much the same as those which i used for moving it <e> <s> that does not get us very far <e> <s> i hope she will take the amendment back and reconsider it <e> <s> i appreciate that the hour is very late but i think the issue should be looked at again because all she said was that drama would go back into english and ballet into physical education <e> <s> i realise as do those people who are concerned with the arts that that is not a good arrangement <e> <s> perhaps she will look again at the matter because none of the amendments has yet been moved <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that when there is insufficient financing to keep the books in good condition universities are encouraged to sell some of them as happened at the rylands library at manchester university <e>", "<cs> my lords it all sounds very good listening to the minister <e> <s> can she tell the house how quickly a decision will be reached on the completion stage once the feasibility study is completed <e> <s> i understand that if the work were speeded up the building could be completed by with great economy of cost and improvement in services <e> <s> secondly can she assure the house that the government will not dispose of the land behind the new building at st pancras after completion of the first stage in <e> <s> although that may be tempting it would be improvident and short sighted <e>", "<cs> my lords i can hardly thank the minister for the answer but i thank him for warning me in advance not his words but mine that my ace is to be trumped this afternoon <e> <s> does the minister appreciate that the much-heralded statement is likely to fill many of us with the gravest concern <e> <s> the proposal for a broadcasting standards council undermines the credibility and the constitutional independence of the bbc and the iba <e> <s> if it is true that sir william rees-mogg is to be chairman then is it not the case <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i do not believe that i am offending against any order of procedure at all <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> one can read from the front bench <e> <s> i had to change several times what i was going to say in view of the unpleasant and unexpected news that hit me just before i came into the chamber <e> <s> my concern is this <e> <s> is it not the case that sir william rees-mogg with his past record in broadcasting will if appointed chairman probably bring in a very strong whiff of censorship as he seeks to shape british television into line with his wishes and those of the government <e> <s> will there not be a great increase in control <e>", "<cs> it is a great pity that the noble baroness lady blatch is not in her seat because she may have been so convinced by the arguments in reply to what she said that she might have changed her mind <e> <s> i cannot agree with the minister when she says that this has not been the case <e> <s> the provision may not have applied before <e> <s> however the subject then became part of the curriculum <e> <s> i must put to the minister that it is a clear change in the law <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord somers for saying that <e> <s> that is exactly the point i was trying to make <e> <s> there is a great difference <e> <s> when one is dealing with young people encouragement is of extreme importance <e> <s> this is what we are talking about <e>", "<cs> i too am delighted to have been joined in this amendment by three colleagues from different parts of the chamber <e> <s> as the noble lord lord st john said they have expressed the views probably of all members of this committee with no party affiliations <e>", "<cs> my lords it is clear that todays debate is particularly timely and we are grateful to the noble lord lord bonham-carter for initiating <e>", "<cs> my lords that is correct a failure <e> <s> i am very grateful to the noble lord because that brings me to another point <e> <s> i believe he said that that programme was one of those failures that are inevitable <e> <s> i have worked for many years as a journalist and i do not believe it is possible to have a fair share of creativity and the freedom to exercise it without on some occasions making a mistake <e> <s> sometimes one falls absolutely flat on ones face <e> <s> that is part of what one has to accept in a democracy <e> <s> we believe in freedom and i do not consider it too high a price to pay <e> <s> if we were squeezed so tightly that nobody could take an adventurous leap without glancing over his shoulder and wondering whether they were going too far our whole culture literature and broadcasting which the noble lord lord bonham-carter quite rightly said is admired all over the world would be far less rich far duller and far less good <e>", "<cs> my lords it has not been seen on television <e> <s> however i shall be interested to know whether the noble lord has seen it because i value his own judgment rather than what he has heard from other people <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so that is a rather dubious judgment and i am rather surprised that the noble lord made it <e> <s> i felt that i owed an apology to the author for inadvertently mentioning tumbledown when i had not seen it <e> <s> however that is probably neither here nor there <e>", "<cs> my lords the problem is that there has been no definitive finding <e> <s> quite recently the wyatt committee which was set up by the bbc to look into violence commissioned a piece of research from dr cumberbatch of aston university <e> <s> the results which came out fairly recently showed that no link could be found <e> <s> one cannot find any scientific or properly approved research <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that people had said that they did not think there was enough and they were sorry that sex was always linked with violence <e> <s> while they thought that there was too much violence when there was talk of too much sex they asked where is it all <e> <s> we never see it <e>", "<cs> my lords my question arises from what the noble earl has just been saying <e> <s> he answered in the affirmative to the noble viscount lord buckmaster that the council would have teeth <e> <s> can he give any indication of what sort of teeth and how they would work <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord haig introduced what has been until now an interesting discussion between like-minded people <e> <s> there has not been a word of dissent <e> <s> the poor minister is left to block many of the things we have been saying <e> <s> i agree with what the noble earl said about quality <e> <s> framing his question as he did has tied us down much better than when we have open-ended arts debates <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to speak on this amendment because i am especially interested in the arts side <e> <s> creative and aesthetic studies seems to be a much better way of dealing with what at committee stage admittedly very late at night we found to be a difficult problem <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter is wrong if he thinks that this was discussed at committee stage <e> <s> arts were discussed only on the amendment which i moved on music <e> <s> that amendment was contained in a group and did not really get a fair hearing <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect it is not <e> <s> this deals with the foundations subjects <e> <s> it alters the list <e> <s> it makes it very much more practical and logical and provides a better way of teaching <e> <s> as the noble baroness lady seear said a cross-curricular attitude is extremely important especially in the area of aesthetic and creative studies <e> <s> this would make it inclusive rather than exclusive and we would not have the unwelcome introduction of the hierarchy which is at present in the bill <e> <s> if the amendments are accepted as i hope they will be i shall be able to withdraw my amendment on the arts which evidently caused the government some problems on the last occasion in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely disappointed <e> <s> i do not think that the ministers answer met any of our concerns <e> <s> am i correct in assuming from what the minister said that visual art and music are the arts subjects that will be considered to start with in primary schools and that the others with luck dance and drama will probably come in later <e> <s> am i correct <e>", "<cs> my lords the only good thing to come out of that reply was the tentative way in which the minister made her last remark <e> <s> she may not have been as unhappy as i am but she did not sound firm or happy about what she said <e> <s> it is clear from what she said that dance and drama may be brought in later <e> <s> she talked about the english group discussing drama and said that physical education covers dance <e> <s> it was for those reasons that i brought forward the amendment once again <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know why the minister thinks those were reassurances <e> <s> they were not reassurances at all <e> <s> it was a very odd way of getting round this and trying to prove that black is white <e> <s> the bill contains a clause that was put in by the government that charges should be made for individual music tuition <e> <s> now the minister is saying that that matter can be left to any school <e> <s> the government have given a very strong specific lead by allowing charges to be made in this bill <e> <s> now the minister says that it is up to the schools <e> <s> but there is nothing to guide them <e> <s> we are talking about children whose parents cannot afford individual tuition <e> <s> i remind the minister that it also appears once again that music and arts have been treated in a far less serious way than the other foundation subjects <e>", "<cs> my lords since the broadcasting research unit found in its recent research for the home office that there is as great a demand for speech on radio as there is for music perhaps the minister can say how the new radio authority will ensure that there are sufficient stations providing programmes with regular national news and local news and information as well as music programmes which are much cheaper and therefore very tempting to produce <e>", "<cs> my lords also join in the paeans of appreciation to the noble lord lord fanshawe for initiating this very interesting and important debate which covers such a wide field but about which he was specific <e> <s> instead of wandering all over the world of art we have at least reduced it to some specific matters which we all feel need to be tackled <e> <s> before i start i say to the minister perhaps using the vernacular of her reply to me in the debate just quoted by the noble earl lord haig youre really on your own old girl tonight arent you <e>", "<cs> my lords i was kind to the minister because i believe that she is suffering from a cold <e> <s> wish her better <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the minister after having said million during the debate which took place the other day withdrew the million and replaced it with a figure of million <e> <s> if by chance this offer does not come to fruition will the government he prepared to take that sum even if they do not use it for the performing arts and use it for the visual arts by starting to reactivate the purchase grants for museums and galleries which have now been frozen for four years <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that during the passage of the legislation we were assured by the government that londons culture would not suffer from the abolition of the glc and that the then minister for the environment in this house the noble lord lord elton said that when the lyceum passed to the london residuary body he expected that body to take into account concerns about the future use of the theatre when considering its ownership <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will say what is <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that in the following episode of this programme two days later the rape victim was persuaded to go to the police station <e> <s> as was shown on television she received a very sympathetic response from a policewoman <e> <s> this fact was praised by the real police <e> <s> is the minister further aware that in an interview with the <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that during the passage of the copyright legislation through the house of commons clause was inserted at third reading and it deals with this very point <e> <s> it extends the power of the secretary of state o impose a compulsory licence on the bbc and itv if the monopolies and mergers commission says that that is appropriate in the particular case <e> <s> if that is so and the matter will come to this chamber on commons amendments why have the government apparently changed their mind <e> <s> there is a difference between what they are doing in one case in the legislation and their reaction to the report of the home affairs select committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the minister for not being here when he rose to his feet <e> <s> i had not been informed that the statement was about to begin <e> <s> from these benches we welcome the aspirations for broadcasting and recognise that some changes are needed <e> <s> unfortunately the proposals as read out by the minister in the statement and spelt out in the white paper which we shall need time to consider are highly unlikely to achieve anything near the target that he has described to us <e>", "<cs> my lords can i ask the minister a point for clarification <e> <s> when he was answering my question about the lighter touch he referred to keeping a restraining hand without too much detail without going too far or words to that effect <e> <s> does that mean there will be no insistence on balance which is one of the cornerstones of the iba <e> <s> it seems to me that that can be the only answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the minister can help me and explain why the government changed their mind about bringing forward a separate radio bill during this parliament but not of course this session <e> <s> is not the minister aware that the white paper is swamped by television and that only two pages out of are devoted to radio <e> <s> something like million people a day get great pleasure out of listening to the radio <e> <s> should not the government think again about separating the radio issue <e> <s> all the concentration discussion and criticism have fastened on television with very little mention of radio <e>", "<cs> my lords in case the minister has misunderstood my question perhaps i should say that i had in mind in the end two smaller bills rather than one very large bill <e> <s> the same amount of legislation would be involved <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> you have already asked a question <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may start by saying that we on these benches understand and wholly share the disgust and the outrage caused by the terrorist organisations and their odious supporters <e> <s> we sympathise deeply with the grief and distress of the victims and their community <e> <s> we would do anything to damage and curtail their murderous activities <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the problem that we are trying to address <e> <s> the noble lord says that only a small number of people is involved <e> <s> but when one starts eroding freedom one stops either a small or a large number of people having access to certain interviews speeches and other things <e> <s> if one places it on a much larger scale one advances the situation a long way <e> <s> with great respect i do not think one can argue in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked the noble earl a question perhaps in an oblique way as did the noble lord lord harris of greenwich and my noble friend lord prys-davies <e> <s> we asked to be told the number of complaints which have been received from the bbc and the iba and the poll to which the minister referred <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister always has the wonderful knack of being able to make anything which some of us may be against or do not like sound extremely attractive <e> <s> once again he has done that <e> <s> i think we are all pleased to hear i am sure he meant it sincerely that the views of members of this house are sought and will be listened to and read <e> <s> i was also delighted that he said that the viewer and listener the consumers are the most important part the most important people in the whole of the white paper and the proposed action that the government intend to take <e> <s> i think we are all bearing that in mind certainly i am as a consumer of <e>", "<cs> my lords on the question that the noble lord raised about the quality requirements i believe that he should be made aware that in the white paper at paragraph where it refers to the protection requirements it states specifically that it proposes <e>", "<cs> my lords while we are delighted to hear about all the people who are supporting museums is the minister aware that the increase for the arts world which she cited is still well below the rate of inflation <e> <s> is it not the case that now the japanese are coming into the art market so strongly and buying works of art of all schools irrespective of those referred to the review committee on the export of works of art that unless purchase funds are increased we shall lose even more of our national heritage <e> <s> moreover is not a substantial increase in purchase funds the best way in which the government can respond to museums year <e>", "<cs> robert louis stevenson <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that to encourage discussions with the british library and the victoria and albert museum will not achieve any results <e> <s> moreover is the minister also aware that the british library has made it quite clear that it cannot back up with money anything that is suggested <e> <s> the va has enough of a serious crisis on its own hands at the moment without this problem <e> <s> is the minister further aware of the unique nature of the british theatre association library and information services and their usage by professional and amateur theatre and increasingly by school groups and people from abroad <e> <s> therefore is it not essential that the small sum which is needed in order to ensure that the library services and the information services are continued should be a high priority in the mind of the right honourable friend of the minister at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the remarks made by the noble lord lord beloff is the minister aware that the british theatre association provides and gathers in the greater part of its funds by its own efforts and spends a great deal of time on that <e> <s> is the minister further aware that a solution to this problem must be found before the end of this month <e> <s> the association will start to pack up in march unless something emerges <e> <s> will the minister bear in mind and remind his right honourable friend of the need for urgency as well as a good solution <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the question tabled by the noble lord lord kennet because it deals with matters which should concern us all but it is specific in its application to avebury <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down he did not comment upon what i said regarding the importance of the world heritage sites <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the government have made a commitment only for the next few years <e> <s> is it not essential for the development of the arts in this country that the centre for young musicians and similar high-grade centres in other parts of the country catering for music or for dance and drama should not be put at risk which many feel that they are at present but encouraged and maintained <e> <s> should not the selection of talented youngsters be on the basis of their ability and not as is likely to be the case of their parents ability to pay <e> <s> does the minister recall that that was the principle which many noble lords tried to amend in the education reform act <e>", "<cs> my lords what is certainly clear from the thyssen affair is that if the will is there government money can be found for acquisitions <e> <s> however to protect the taxpayers money will the government as a matter of urgency ask the museums and galleries commission to look into the current extravagant valuations which lead to the loss of major masterpieces such as the impending export of the late lord clarkes seascape folkestone by turner and then make recommendations <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there is a private bill not yet introduced but which has been printed called the kings cross railways bill <e> <s> if that bill goes through under clause british rail will be able to override all the existing listed building legislation <e> <s> that would affect in particular the great northern hotel which is listed grade ii <e> <s> the station itself is listed grade i one objective is i understand that one of the terminals should provide a link for the channel tunnel <e> <s> can the minister give an assurance that the government will oppose clause of the bill and insist that british rail should go through the usual processes of listed building legislation so that development can be appealed against <e> <s> such legislation should not be passed <e>", "<cs> my lords when i first saw the unstarred question put down on the order paper by the noble lord lord bonham-carter my immediate reaction was that it was a pity that he had not left well alone <e> <s> we had heard a great deal about the subject and i also felt that it would result in more stress for the noble lord lord windlesham <e> <s> however the debate tonight has convinced me that the noble lord was absolutely right to air the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a long but enthralling debate and i shall endeavour not to delay the house for too long <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to hear that but i must stress that i was not giving the party <e> <s> however my lords there was a feeling of anger <e> <s> indeed one could breathe the anger and despair in the air <e> <s> it seemed that what had been done had however unwittingly created that feeling and that it was something which really ought to be put right as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the noble lord being slightly contradictory <e> <s> when i first referred to clause of the bill in a supplementary question to a question on rd february he gave the same reply as he gave just now to the original question <e> <s> he said that it was for parliament to decide <e> <s> he also said on rd february in answer to other supplementary questions to the original question asked by the noble baroness lady strange <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware that the noble lord is the minister for transport but can he tell the house whether this project has been discussed or is constantly discussed with his right honourable friend and his colleagues in the department of the environment <e> <s> i ask this question because that department is the one which is responsible for the matter about which we have all shown great concern <e>", "<cs> my lords is it true that the scaffolding which those hoardings are meant to hide is not even up yet <e> <s> perhaps the minister will tell us how long it will be before the scaffolding is erected and whether the period will be extended at the other end so that people will become so accustomed to the hoardings that they will just remain there <e> <s> perhaps he will also tell us whether consideration could be given to a government advertisement being put on one of the hoardings stating these advertisements were made possible by the unhappy lack of funds given by the government to provide for the proper maintenance of this museum <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to add my congratulations to the noble and learned lord lord oliver not only for the way in which he introduced the report this evening but also for both his excellent chairmanship of the sub-committee of which i had the honour to be a member and his infinite patience with witnesses and members of the sub-committee alike <e> <s> for someone who has sat on one of his sub-committees it is impossible not to come to the conclusion that even the most ardent and <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendments standing in my name to the new government clause fall into two groups <e> <s> i shall try to be as brief as i can in dealing with them <e> <s> i was extremely sorry not to have been present at the committee stage <e> <s> i am very grateful to my noble friends lord mcintosh of haringey and lord graham of edmonton who moved the amendments on my behalf <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lady white put a question to me and my noble friend lord mcintosh <e> <s> i agree entirely with what my noble friend has said <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend who is leading on this bill will also comment on this <e> <s> the alternative would have been to have received answers to every group of amendments <e> <s> i do not know whether the government will comment on that <e> <s> we and i imagine my noble friend lady nicol have tried to keep the groups together <e> <s> i do not know what the answer is to this problem <e> <s> i think it is more a question for the government than for us <e> <s> when we were shown the groupings by the government we tried to do our best to give them some logical sense <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord i do not know how to put the situation right <e> <s> i thought that the minister was replying to amendments nos <e> <s> to after which i should deal with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i realise now that he is dealing with the whole group <e> <s> perhaps he would allow me to say a few words now on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord very much <e> <s> we appear to be in competition as to who is more wrong <e> <s> i feel that the fault is mine but never mind <e> <s> we return to the desirability of protecting the heritage a matter which arose at the committee stage <e> <s> it was touched on quite considerably this afternoon when we were discussing amendment no <e> <s> but i am sorry to say that i felt very little joy from the outcome <e> <s> the ministers response as regards the man-made environment the heritage was most upsetting and disappointing <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall speak to amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> that is a rather different amendment but i am perfectly happy to speak to it <e> <s> these are all slightly different amendments <e> <s> i think that i should prefer to divide them <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that very well but after all that we have heard about grouping earlier this afternoon i should have thought that it would be a great relief and that everyone would be pleased to consider these matters singly instead of their being grouped <e> <s> i am prepared to go on so long as i can be assured that the amendments will be dealt with separately <e> <s> in that case i shall continue <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl and should like to respond first to the good news <e> <s> i am most grateful to him for accepting amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i tabled the amendment because the archaeologists are worried not just about the conservation of the building sites and so on but the <e>", "<cs> my lords yes and i shall not move the other amendments including amendment no <e> <s> c in the hope that the government will come back with something on that <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect that amendment comes in a different grouping <e> <s> it is all very confusing <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> however i am a little perplexed because when his noble friend replied to a somewhat similar amendment in committee i explained how it differed from this amendment and how i felt this amendment was better the words used on that occasion were exactly the same as those used today <e> <s> the words used were <e>", "<cs> my lords the provision has now been taken on board twice so perhaps at a later stage of the bill we will hear what is being done about this matter or hear what the government propose to put in the code <e> <s> once the bill is passed and becomes law it will be very difficult to do anything at all about this <e> <s> we must obtain something more than a vague promise <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that in this country we deal with our archaeological remains no matter how important they are in a very haphazard and hand-to-mouth way <e> <s> does the minister not agree that it would be a good idea for the planning process to be strengthened to the extent that it ensures that sites are evaluated <e> <s> does he not further agree that as regards those that have any archaeological interest at all proposals should be made on the basis of those evaluations <e> <s> the evaluation should also include a short survey before planning consent is given <e> <s> does the minister not agree that such a procedure would entail greater ease of operation for the developer and that the preservation and conservation of sites could be achieved without having to go through all the hassle that has taken place with the rose theatre <e> <s> it does not appear that whatever the decision regarding the rose theatre it will be entirely satisfactory all round <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps before he sits down the minister can clarify one point <e> <s> he said that the code cannot be ignored by the undertakers <e> <s> he also explained why the government do not want <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that that answer is very unsatisfactory but i shall take it away and consider very carefully what the minister has said <e> <s> i shall then decide how to proceed at the next stage <e> <s> i do not think that his remarks tie up with the contents of the other clauses of the bill <e> <s> they make the code of practice seem an even weaker vessel than we had feared before <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords while agreeing that parish churches have much less recourse to obtaining funds and sponsors than cathedrals have and therefore they should have priority will the minister also agree that some of our great cathedrals in this country are really falling down very badly <e> <s> does that not mean that some additional funding is necessary to prevent cathedrals such as salisbury hereford and ely from ruining their essential character in a desperate attempt to raise money for repairs and preservation <e> <s> would it not therefore be a good idea to set up an organisation similar to the national trust but making it a national trust for cathedrals <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that during the committee stage of the local government finance bill on an amendment proposed by the noble lord lord carr to which i was a co-signatory the noble earl lord caithness on june th at col of <e>", "<cs> my lords i start by thanking the noble earl lord ferrers for repeating the statement made by his right honourable friend in another place <e> <s> i am sure he will appreciate that it is a very long statement to take in in such a short time <e> <s> i shall do <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down i should like to ask him one question <e> <s> how many licences will the companies be allowed to apply for <e> <s> at present they can apply for only two franchises <e> <s> the rumour is that it will be multiple and i should like to have the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the minister now talking to amendments nos <e> <s> and and not to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> my lords we are delighted and pleased that the government have moved this amendment <e> <s> as the noble earl indicated on report it will give access to and covers archaeological historic and architectural sites <e> <s> i do not wish to appear churlish but i am sad that a number of other amendments of equal importance and some which were perhaps more important in the field of archaeology have been resisted by the government all the way through our debates on the bill <e> <s> nevertheless we are pleased that the proposal has been accepted <e> <s> the amendment is important because without it there would have been the opportunity for access to recreational ground waters and so forth but not to the ancient monuments buildings and other areas covered by it <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the safeguards available for controlling british satellite broadcasting as outlined by the minister do not cover sky television which has four channels aimed at this country <e> <s> it is running its satellite operations from this country and its owner news international controls per cent <e> <s> of national newspapers in the country <e> <s> how is that consistent with the government controls which we understand from the statements made by the government are to be exercised by the iba and then the itc to ensure that no newspaper proprietor has a controlling interest in any tv station <e> <s> will the government legislate to block this loophole <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted about what the minister said concerning the appointment <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for that answer is he aware that the decision to destroy the best surviving collection of victorian commercial buildings in the city based on <e>", "<cs> my lords in replying to what the noble lords lord st john of fawsley and lord jenkin of roding said is it not true and it was the noble lord lord jenkin of roding who when he was secretary of state gave a green light to a further development after the original planning application was turned down that there are plenty of places where a replacement of some rather mediocre modern or not-so-old buildings would be very welcome <e> <s> are we not here discussing whether in this paticular part of the city listed buildings should be destroyed in order to make way for a new building <e>", "<cs> my lords if the local authorities have the power to ask for information about the archaeology of a proposed building site <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it is our turn now <e> <s> since local authorities have the power to ask for information about the archaeology of a proposed building site will the minister therefore agree that where there is any archaeological interest known to be involved the local authority should be required not just be responsible to ensure that a full archaeological search of a site takes place before planning permission is granted so as to prevent in the future an occurrence of the unhappy situation we have seen arise on this occasion <e>", "<cs> the minister explained as cogently and elegantly as anyone could explain something that is extremely squalid and very damaging <e> <s> the amendment has a history <e> <s> it goes back long before the ministers time he must have been a young man then and has been referred to by my noble friend lord mcintosh and the noble lord lord evans of claughton <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord will give way to answer a question <e> <s> he says that the property will be ocupied <e> <s> of course it could be and of course there is a shortage of housing for young people as well <e> <s> but will he take into consideration that an extra investment has gone into the houses which have been adapted or designed for elderly people and those will be slipping out of the housing stock <e> <s> that is an important point <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support what has been said by the noble lords lord mcintosh and lord callaghan <e> <s> the housing world reacted with alarm and tremendous concern directly after the inclusion was announced in the bill of clause <e> <s> it was announced in this house late at night without warning with no consultation and without proper explanation <e> <s> the issue came up just before midnight at the committee stage two weeks ago <e> <s> it has been extensively debated in this house for nearly years <e> <s> during that time i was involved in the discussions <e> <s> i did not see the result as a triumph neither a personal triumph nor a triumph for the opposition but a triumph for good sense a triumph for this house and a triumph for spreading more adequately the housing that is needed for elderly people <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords following the decision that i believe was arrived at last week have there been any representations by the turkish community especially as the broadcasting time of that <e>", "<cs> my lords the situation is now far better than it was when we debated the bill and the right to sell applied to houses that had been adapted for the elderly <e> <s> that was a point about which many of us felt very strongly <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to express my thanks to the noble earl lord perth for letting us have the opportunity again to discuss the arts in this house <e> <s> it is probably the one occasion when we are all on the side of the angels <e> <s> we are all agreed wherever we happen to sit in the house and there is not a great deal of bite in the debate except towards the government whichever government it may be <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down i wonder whether he remembers that i did in fact ask him several questions about the museum training institute <e> <s> however if he does not have the information now perhaps he will undertake to write to me on the matter <e> <s> i merely make this request because he made no mention of the matter in his reply <e>", "<cs> my lords according to the minister the responses were placed in the library in november <e> <s> the minister did not refer to that fact when he was questioned on this matter in the debate which took place on th december last year <e> <s> why has no action been taken on the matter especially as the secretary of state is reluctant to schedule additional designated sites <e> <s> that has been demonstrated in the case of the rose theatre <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that when the prime minister opened the reorganised tate gallery last week she said that the government had the task of trying to keep the great galleries open with the help of the taxpayers <e> <s> it is quite right that paintings should be loaned to regional and other museums but does the minister not agree that that entails additional cost which makes matters very difficult for the museums and galleries and particularly difficult for the tate <e> <s> does the minister not agree that unless the government assist by giving extra public money it is very hard to get private sponsors to contribute <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may join the noble lord lord st john of fawsley in congratulating mr jacob rothschild on his magnificent offer <e> <s> i hope that the government will see fit to accept it unless they are prepared to come up with the million themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the injunction for judicial review can the minister tell the house whether the period of the export ban will be extended before the final decision is made on the export of this work of art <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that a balance means a proper range of views <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has rather brushed aside the question and the present plight of the rsc <e> <s> is the minister aware that the per cent <e> <s> increase which he spoke about rather glibly represents only per cent <e> <s> above the rate of inflation <e> <s> the priestley report mentioned index linking but that has not been taken up <e> <s> that report together with the cork report and the recent wilding report have all stressed the palpable underfunding of the national company <e> <s> is the minister also aware that the chief executive of royal insurance which has given more than million since to the rsc has complained that as its private sponsorship increases so the rate of government subsidy decreases <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister placate some of the worries about this question and tell us whether as the itc will be a much smaller body than the iba it will be able to afford to pay retirement pensions to existing iba pensioners at the current rate <e> <s> would he care to comment on the fact that the pension rights of those employed up to now by the cable authority are specifically mentioned in schedule to the bill while employees of the iba and other people referred to only in schedule are covered not specifically but simply by the phrase <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to press the matter but as it is left in the bill some present and future pensioners could be worse off than they are at the moment <e> <s> does the provision take into account that a number of people i believe something like per cent <e> <s> of engineers will be going to a privatised transmission company <e>", "<cs> my lords in giving three cheers in which i join up to a point will the minister point out to his right honourable friend the difference between the offer by the barclay brothers and that by the now noble lord lord rothschild <e> <s> is it not true that the barclay brothers offer is that the statue should be on public view for years at the va and at a scottish gallery <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to press this point but is it not a fact that million a year is supposed to be put aside by the treasury for these acceptance-in-lieu offers <e> <s> that allowance was not <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth for explaining the bill and the motives of the promoters so clearly and also for saving me the trouble of providing the history of the matter and making the house such as it is listen to that all over again <e> <s> i shall come straight to the aims of the bill <e> <s> paragraph on page of the bill states that the council <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord tell me where education facilities come into that <e> <s> my notes have been whisked away to <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps he will answer a question <e> <s> what he said about the amounts of money being spent on the park was very heartening <e> <s> was he speaking on his own behalf and with hopefulness or was he speaking on behalf of bromley borough council <e>", "<cs> my lords one of my worst nightmares is that i shall wake up and find myself answering on this side of the house being the last speaker in an arts debate which up till then has been entirely taken up by the great and the good with people who have had experience as past chairmen of the arts council ex-ministers of the arts and so on <e> <s> there are practically no indians here today it is practically all chiefs who have spoken in the debate apart from the noble baroness lady elliot and myself if she does not mind being classified in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords given the way that the minister looked at me when speaking about local councillors i thought that he had perhaps misunderstood me <e> <s> i was arguing that local councillors should be involved <e> <s> for those few minutes i was on his side <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the minister a little more about the warders of the tower of london and their feelings of loss of morale <e> <s> i understand that what has been put forward by the noble earl is quite true <e> <s> but at any point have there been consultations with them about that change <e> <s> does the noble lord agree that there have been changes or talk of changes <e> <s> there was quite a lot about that in the press <e> <s> when i telephoned the agency i was given absolutely no information apart from being told that what was in the press was <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the ministers answer to my noble friend does he agree with the answer which his ministerial colleague mr trippier gave in another place on st february of this year <e> <s> he said <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has not given much more information than he gave a month ago <e> <s> like the noble lord i too should like to be assured regarding the length of time that the statue <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister did not answer one very important point <e> <s> is it true that if and when this decision is made it will be by personal edict of the minister and will not be discussed in parliament in order to seek parliamentary approval <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the genuine concern about the ownership as opposed to religious programming of channels by religious bodies are the government satisfied that the itc will be able to regulate the religious content of <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the complexity of this matter which has been demonstrated this afternoon will the government require the itc to publish the criteria on which it will judge whether to license religious broadcasting channels <e> <s> i fear that if it does not there will be even more confusion and anxiety <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that the most contentious issue with regard to satellite broadcasting is multi-media ownership <e> <s> does not the minister therefore think it right that all satellite stations whose programmes are transmitted to and within the uk should be subject to the same cross-media ownership rules which apply to all tv stations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to come back but with great respect the minister cannot give that as a complete answer when it is well known that sky television and mr murdoch own about per cent <e> <s> of the national daily papers and even more of the sunday papers which blatantly breaks that rule <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first thank the minister for his usual concise and very good explanation of the bill <e> <s> like many of us he did not get to bed early last night and it looks like a late night tonight <e> <s> i also look forward to hearing the four maiden speeches today from my noble friend lord morris of castle morris the right reverend prelate the bishop of peterborough the noble earl lord glasgow and my very old friend the noble lord lord grade <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that but is he saying that there is a quality threshold for radio in the same way as there is now supposed to be a quality threshold for television companies <e> <s> i do not think so <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that neither cable nor satellite were yet substitutes for terrestrial channels because as we all know very well and i shall not repeat the argument there are not at present sufficient programmes on them not enough people have them and there are still the costs to be compared with terrestrial channels <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that it is a long time ago but i said that i was grateful for the improvements which have been made to the bill <e> <s> of course i went on to say that a great deal more needed to be done <e> <s> however i acknowledged the improvements <e>", "<cs> my lords every time a question is asked on the arts we are all pleased to recognise the governments great support and recognition of whichever theatre or museum is mentioned <e> <s> nevertheless did the minister not say that there were lean periods for arts companies <e> <s> is it right that arts companies should go through continuous lean periods and be underfunded all the time <e> <s> that is the case here <e> <s> it has been pointed out not only by the priestly and cork reports but also by the recent wilding report <e> <s> are the government prepared to do something about it before arts companies start to lose all the business sponsorship that has been gained <e>", "<cs> my lords should not the government give the arts council more money so that it has the opportunity to give bigger subsidies <e>", "<cs> i cannot say that the noble earls answer is satisfactory <e> <s> i was not quite sure to whom the noble lord lord quinton was referring <e> <s> he seemed to be exercised by the fact that someone had referred to information and education and not entertainment or vice versa <e> <s> if it was me i do not remember it and it would have been a slip of the tongue <e>", "<cs> all that has been said is true <e> <s> the noble lord lord winstanley is quite right we are talking about two different concepts <e> <s> when the words that i wish to insert in the bill were included in the broadcasting conditions they appeared in the broadcasting act companies still had to go through a so-called hoop <e> <s> however changes are now taking place <e> <s> if the auction procedure remains that would present an entirely different case over which the itc would certainly not have anything like the control that the iba had <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord marsh is wrong because the last labour government appointed more conservatives than many supporters were happy about <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter is right <e> <s> we are talking about collective bargaining and agreements and when these matters will be discussed <e> <s> that is not to say that they should be one sided and that the itc should immediately agree with everything put forward by the unions <e> <s> that is not how i understand the matter <e> <s> if collective bargaining and negotiations feature in the act i cannot understand why they should not appear in this bill <e> <s> it is not some great draconian measure <e>", "<cs> there is very little left for me to say <e> <s> my noble friends lord willis lord howie and lady phillips have said it all <e> <s> the response was unfortunate <e> <s> perhaps when members of the committee read the amendment more carefully in conjunction with the bill they will understand that it is intended to make provision for collective bargaining and for negotiation and collective agreement <e> <s> in the meantime it is quite clear that i shall not get far with it this afternoon <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before we continue perhaps i may say that amendment no <e> <s> which removes the general duty of the radio authority to appoint advisory committees does not give any indication of having any connection with religion <e> <s> we have tabled amendments after that setting up other advisory bodies <e> <s> i could not find out clearly enough when negotiations were going on this morning whether the noble earls amendment was in the religious field or the general field <e>", "<cs> before amendment no <e> <s> is lost in this sea of amendments i want to say that i feel most unhappy about the amendment of the noble earl lord halsbury <e> <s> although he said that it is a probing amendment it seems to be a little heavy handed to get rid of all advisory committees when in the vernacular he appears to be gunning at a particular one <e>", "<cs> it is a permissive power so they do not have to if they do not want to and if nobody wants them <e> <s> i am concerned because my noble friend lord thomson and i have a later amendment <e> <s> i do not know what time of night or early morning it will be called so i think that i had better say something now <e> <s> otherwise members of the committee will have gone home or worse still we might still be talking about the different religious aspects <e> <s> i think it is quite wrong to do it in this way when some of us want to talk about advisory committees for entirely different reasons <e> <s> the religious advisory committee is one kind and as there are advisory committees i do not see any reason why i should not have one as well <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> does not stand in my name <e> <s> i do not go along with it <e> <s> i am talking about amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> if the noble earl lord halsbury succeeded in his amendment amendment no <e> <s> could not be accepted <e>", "<cs> it does not seem that we can get much further tonight <e> <s> i am not convinced by the ministers arguments about the committees <e> <s> we have heard from other speakers of experience where there are advisory committees to the effect that they are extremely useful and helpful <e> <s> there does not appear to be any reason why that provision should not be undertaken <e> <s> they were in the act and they were working at that time <e>", "<cs> i have very little more to say <e> <s> i wondered what the minister was up to <e> <s> he was answering amendment no <e> <s> as well <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> referred to the regional level <e> <s> this amendment refers to the national or regional provision as being appropriate <e> <s> the same arguments apply <e> <s> i shall not move this amendment <e>", "<cs> i support the noble lord lord bonham-carter <e> <s> i put my name to the amendment <e> <s> he explained it thoroughly and concisely <e> <s> we wish the words taken as a whole to remain in the subsection <e> <s> the disagreement seems to be over where the words should be <e>", "<cs> i think that there has been a misunderstanding <e> <s> the noble lord stated that he thought that it was proposed to move taken as a whole to the end of the sentence <e> <s> however it is not <e> <s> under the amendment the phrase should read <e>", "<cs> with respect i think that the meaning is clearer <e> <s> the noble lord lord harmarnicholls is obviously intelligent and picks things up very quickly <e> <s> with respect this matter has confused him so it must be in the wrong place <e>", "<cs> are the government intending to bring in an amendment in a different clause <e> <s> i do not believe that the position to which the minister referred has yet brought forth any new amendment from the government <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment of the noble lord lord thomson of monifieth <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> a is grouped with amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> as the noble lord said the object of the amendments is to try to stop any possibility of monopolies arising with a concentration of ownership so that we achieve the greater diversity of ownership that i have always understood that the government desire <e>", "<cs> when did i say that newspapers should be censored <e> <s> i did not say anything about newspapers being censored <e>", "<cs> the noble lord should explain what he meant and say what he thought i said

back-bencher from another place <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down perhaps i may put a question <e> <s> mine was a paving amendment to the main amendment <e> <s> am i right in understanding that as matters stand at the moment if other people come forward and wish to own non-domestic satellites there will be no holds barred at all that there will be no resistance from the government for

he was that there would be no government control over them <e>", "<cs> it seems quite a long time ago that i moved this amendment <e> <s> we seem to have gone round and round in circles <e> <s> however i have just two points to make before i put this amendment to the vote <e> <s> i believe the noble earl lord bessborough and someone else mentioned the absence of newspaper satellite ownership cartels in both america and australia <e> <s> in both cases that is because the satellite television industry is virtually non-existent <e> <s> there are sufficient terrestrial channels to satisfy consumer demand <e> <s> it is unlikely that satellite television will become established in either country certainly not in the foreseeable future <e>", "<cs> thank you very much <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have my name to the amendment <e> <s> i was anxious to hear what the minister had to say as i thought that it might not be necessary for me to speak <e> <s> what he said has made me rather more worried about the provision <e> <s> i understood him to say that the provision would operate before the programme went on the air or on view <e> <s> who will decide that the programme will incite public disorder <e> <s> i leave for a moment the point put by the noble lord lord bonham-carter with which i have some sympathy that a number of matters mentioned will be caught by other more specific provisions <e>", "<cs> the minister said that the words go back over years <e> <s> he also said that fashions change <e> <s> is it not time that the words were looked at again <e>", "<cs> i shall want to read what the minister has said and if necessary return to the matter on report <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the debate with great care it is an extremely important one but with increasing amazement <e> <s> it is extraordinary that so many intelligent well-meaning men and women can produce arguments which are completely out of touch with reality <e> <s> they talk as though people were sealed in a vacuum and did not know what is going on <e> <s> they treat people as though they were all

members of the committee present <e> <s> however this matter has worried many people <e> <s> they are concerned that so much advertising time has been utilised by the government <e> <s> it is impossible for a government to extend the provision of public service material in that way without that becoming a political act <e> <s> that is a fact <e> <s> i n the circumstances i shall withdraw the amendment but i reserve the right to bring it back on report <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not find that reply very satisfactory even at this time of night <e> <s>

important one <e> <s> it will not wreck the bill <e> <s> perhaps after a good nights sleep the government might change their minds <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i also support the amendment moved by my noble friend <e> <s> i believe that the government indicated that the existing structure of htv would probably be maintained as it has two main bases in

groupings states clearly that it is <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether i am mistaken <e> <s> i thought the minister said that he would accept the two groups of amendments in the name of the noble lord

and quite unexpected news <e> <s> i owe the noble lord lord winstanley an apology <e> <s> however i thought it was important to get the matter in detail on the record <e> <s> i understand that the

no <e> <s> b <e>", "<cs> the specific matter on which i wanted to speak was amendment no <e> <s> b <e> <s> as i understand it that defines the exceptional circumstances in relation to cable services as being when the applicants technical plan proposes to cover a substantially greater area than the highest bidder <e> <s> exceptional circumstances for the channel applicant are defined as a service of substantially or exceptionally higher quality but this amendment implies that the greater the potential audience the better the service <e> <s> i do not think that that follows <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> i heard him say before that there had been a commitment but as we are examining the bill now naturally we are not bound by that ourselves in committee at this moment <e> <s> as he quite rightly said i also pointed out the cash problem and the problem of setting up an infrastructure <e> <s> however it makes it all the more worrying to try to solve the problem that way because it does not solve the problem and may result in a wrong definition of better quality <e> <s> according to the bill it appears to depend on greater coverage <e> <s> if as the minister agrees there appears to be a scarcity of cash with regard to cabling the only result will be cheaper and worse programmes <e>", "<cs> i support the amendments dealt with by the noble lord lord thomson of monifieth <e> <s> he explained them all so clearly that i do not wish to rehearse it all again <e> <s> i wish to stress that amendment no <e> <s> a which he moved clearly and powerfully concerns local programming which is enormously important and we have heard in previous amendments of some of the financial problems that cable companies have had <e> <s> it is possible to rely on syndicated national or even international satellite to cable channels <e> <s> it can be less expensive both in money and personnel to take these programmes rather than to introduce local programming <e> <s> however curiously enough cable is a particularly useful potential medium for providing local programming unless commercial pressures cause operators to prefer syndicated material <e>", "<cs> it is very interesting that the minister should say in answer to the question put to him by my noble friend lord thomson of monifieth that the government believe that there must be more choice for cable operators <e> <s> he did not say anything about the choice or lack of choice for the viewer <e> <s> that seems to sum up the position <e>", "<cs> we are opposed to clause <e> <s> like the earlier clause it goes right to the heart of the bill and reinforces the auction and cash bid system that we have been trying to eliminate <e> <s> as we pointed out the governments guiding principle clearly expressed particularly in clauses and is that the most money and not the highest quality should be the fundamental arbiter of licence allocation <e> <s> despite the extremely good work of the other place in defining exceptional circumstances in clause that is still the primary and overriding part of the clause <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord bonham-carter <e> <s> this afternoon we have attempted to get rid of the auctions in the field of radio <e> <s> we have tried to get an injection of public service broadcasting into it but in neither case have we received any support or sympathy from the government <e>", "<cs> i thought that it might be better if we had an answer to the specific point that was raised before my noble friend deals with the other amendment <e>", "<cs> before the minister sits down there has to be a threshold of quality for television before we reach exceptional circumstances <e> <s> at some point that threshold has to be judged <e> <s> someone has to make a decision <e> <s> if that is being done for television i do not see why it should not be done for radio <e> <s> the noble earl lord onslow is wrong <e> <s> it is the reverse of what he said <e> <s> we say that people deserve quality whatever programme they may be watching <e> <s> why should they not have quality <e> <s> it is not stuffy or indigestible <e> <s> if we <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may point out that the amendment refers to national services <e> <s> it does not refer to local services <e> <s> we are talking about the three national stations <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment moved by the noble lord lord thomson of monifieth and which is tabled in both our names <e> <s> he explained extremely well the current problem of transmitters and transmissions and the inequities that can arise <e> <s> as i understand it the london area television viewing audience of million needs only one transmitter and boosters <e> <s> that ensures that all households have <e>", "<cs> i can quite see that this is difficult but the noble lord lord bonham-carter has made out a good case <e> <s> one does not want to tie people down in some illegal activity from which they cannot escape and they are much more likely to continue with radio piracy if they do not have the incentive of applying for one of the local stations or community radio <e>", "<cs> i wish to support what my noble friend has said particularly on the matter of good taste <e> <s> at the risk of quarrelling with the right reverend prelate i should say with respect that i think that good taste is a meaningless concept <e> <s> what is good taste to one person is not good taste to another <e> <s> it is a highly subjective matter <e> <s> people think for instance that someones furniture in his home is in bad taste <e>", "<cs> i was under the impression that we had already dealt with this matter <e>", "<cs> i confess that i am very surprised at the amendment <e> <s> i believe that i have seen the same paragraph relating to television research in the bill <e> <s> it seems very strange <e> <s> if we are trying to ascertain public opinion concerning the types of programme that members of the public would like included in licensed services i do not understand why research should not be undertaken on the effects of such programmes on the attitudes and behaviour of people who listen to them <e>", "<cs> if it is considered necessary to provide for that as regards television why is it removed as regards radio <e>", "<cs> that is not what the amendment states <e> <s> it does not state that the provision relates only to local radio stations but that it is all right for national stations <e> <s> it does not state what the minister has said <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the amendment from these benches <e> <s> although not explicitly on the face of the bill the itc should be required to issue similar guidelines to applicants as is now the case with channel <e> <s> no doubt the minister will argue that with regard to channel applicants the requirement is not on the face of the bill the difference is that with channel applicants there is a quality duty written in that is not written in here <e> <s> perhaps noble lords who were here as late as some of us last night will remember that we divided the committee on the question of quality <e> <s> unfortunately we lost the division <e> <s> therefore quality is not defined in the bill it is not in this part of the bill at all <e> <s> it makes one think that the government have something against the word quality which they are prolonging <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down perhaps i may put this point to him because there is one aspect that i do not understand <e> <s> he twice asked what could be put in the illustrative guidelines <e> <s> all we are saying is that they should indicate the range of programmes that the authority feels should be transmitted <e> <s> it is all very well starting with an open mind but the authority cannot start with a completely blank mind <e>", "<cs> it was unfair of the minister to say in reply to my noble friend lord ardwick that he was quite right to pursue their lobby <e> <s> it is not just a case of pursuing a lobby <e> <s> it is true that the musicians union is concerned about the situation and with good reason <e> <s> however the objective is to protect live music so that we do not reach a situation in this country in which everything is recorded and there is no live music <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the committee for not having realised that the amendment would come up for discussion so soon <e> <s> this is a very unfortunate amendment <e> <s> it gives different definitions of exceptional circumstances for radio without explaining them <e> <s> it weakens the situation for radio compared with television and the itc <e> <s> it gives the authority no direction when defining exceptional circumstances allowing it to interpret them in different ways for different licences <e> <s> it could mean that the speech-based channel is awarded to a higher quality bidder while the popular music channel is awarded to a bidder who could target a higher proportion of listeners in say social classes a b and c <e>", "<cs> it was never my intention to take the matter to a vote <e> <s> however it appears that support is greater for news on local radio stations than for the ministers response <e> <s> he is in the minority as regards members who have spoken <e> <s> i realise that that does not necessarily mean anything when the division bells ring <e> <s> the cohorts who have not heard a word of our debate will stream in <e> <s> nevertheless i wish to test the opinion of the committee <e>", "<cs> members from all sides of the committee have spoken in support and heads were nodding like mad behind the minister <e>", "<cs> i want to ask some questions about iba staff <e> <s> the debate on whether schedule shall stand part seems the appropriate point to do so <e> <s> some of the former iba staff who have been offered employment with the new privatised transmission company have been offered an option of equity participation in the company <e> <s> can the minister confirm that all former iba staff will be consulted and given the option of employee participation in the running and ownership of shares in the privatised transmission company <e> <s> what is the governments view of possible employee participation <e> <s> what does the future hold for them in the privatisation <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but i thought that the minister was going to give a fuller explanation <e> <s> i understand that some of the former iba staff have been offered either employment with the new privatised transmission company or an option of equity participation in the company <e> <s> i am talking about all former iba staff <e> <s> i should like to know whether they have been consulted and will be given the same sort of option <e> <s> i ask this because they will no longer be employed by the iba once the bill becomes enacted and the itc takes over <e> <s> will they be given the option of employer participation or the option of ownership of shares in the privatised transmission company <e> <s> the position is not very clear under the provisions of the bill <e> <s> can the minister help us in this respect <e>", "<cs> can the noble viscount say whether the grouping includes amendment no <e> <s> t <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask some questions about the amendments <e> <s> probably it is my lack of understanding that necessitates them <e> <s> the loan will be used to set up the company to start with as i understand it <e> <s> the government have received a great many offers about to take the company over <e> <s> how will they decide <e> <s> once again may we know what the employee participation will be in all this <e> <s> i believe that i am right in saying that the itv companies and the bbc are excluded from these sales <e> <s> can the minister say specifically what the money will be spent on <e> <s> is it general infrastructure <e> <s> some million rising to million is a lot of money and i hope that it does not somehow manage to disappear <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble viscount will allow me to put a further question <e> <s> will the method of sale be decided during the progress of the bill or afterwards once it has become law <e>", "<cs> if the minister cannot tell me now perhaps he can tell me definitely at the next stage <e> <s> i do not fancy his i fancy <e>", "<cs> am i right in assuming that a price waterhouse report will be issued on the method of sale <e> <s> will the government publish that report <e>", "<cs> why should such a report not be made public once a company has been nominated <e> <s> we are talking about public money <e>", "<cs> that is a pity <e> <s> the government might not get into such a mess if they published such details <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord thomson referred to the council as being unnecessary and said that its functions would be carried out by other people <e> <s> it is extremely important to get this matter straight before we go into some of the other reasons why the council should not be given statutory status <e> <s> in the first place it is responsible for drawing up a code in consultation with the broadcasting authorities and others <e> <s> that is on page seven of the latest annual report <e> <s> the duty to do that is found in clauses and <e> <s> that duplicates the responsibilities of the itc <e>", "<cs> i did not for one moment expect the minister to agree with me <e> <s> if he had i should have been absolutely shell-shocked <e> <s> however he must not spread what is merely a subjective view on quality <e> <s> i do not know how he can say that quality is measured by the broadcasting standards council <e> <s> of course he believes in it i do not <e> <s> moreover i have a right not to do so <e>", "<cs> i support the amendments tabled by the noble and learned lord lord havers who explained them clearly for the non-lawyers in the house <e> <s> it is interesting that in the standing committee in the other place the minister agreed that the defence should be amended to take account of the particular needs and duties of broadcasting <e> <s> it is that point to which the noble and learned lord addressed himself in his amendments <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i was trying to explain that that was the alternative and why the noble and learned lord found that not satisfactory and therefore tabled the amendments that he has just moved <e> <s> the examples he gave explained very clearly the amendments themselves are selfexplanatory the position in which a person quite innocently could find himself <e> <s> it is a great risk <e> <s> it <e>", "<cs> when we were discussing this matter late last night my noble friend lord mcintosh to some extent supported some of the amendments moved by the noble lord lord monson <e> <s> we feel that at least two of them offer some sensible compromise to the measures proposed by the government but that is not because we hold any brief for radio caroline <e> <s> the main point made by the government relates to interference to existing legitimate incremental broadcasts in london <e> <s> the amendment puts that point right and it deserves some consideration <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment to which my name is attached <e> <s> i think the noble lord lord thomson of monifieth has very clearly explained it <e> <s> he has made an extremely persuasive case that it would be hard to reject <e> <s> as he pointed out this question of listed events goes back a long way <e> <s> after its introduction in the television act it was carried forward in section of the broadcasting act which allowed the secretary of state to make regulations <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to all that has been said <e> <s> over the past few months i have heard from all sides of an ongoing dispute <e> <s> i have come to the conclusion that the government are to be congratulated on finding a compromise in what was a very difficult and irate situation <e> <s> noble lords look surprised <e> <s> whether the solution will stick i do not know <e> <s> the noble lord was right to say that he would consider whether there was a need to issue any guidelines to the copyright tribunal <e> <s> there may be some hitches but the latest information that i have received from <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask a brief question of the minister <e> <s> there is no mention of the bbc in any of the amendments <e> <s> can the minister say whether the bbc is able to draw upon the gaelic television fund in scotland <e>", "<cs> i support the setting up of a commission to contribute to the maintenance of a national television archive and i support what the noble lord lord lloyd of hampstead has said <e> <s> i was a governor of the bfi for a number of years <e> <s> i am well aware of the amazing work that it has done nationally and internationally <e> <s> it is a major cultural force nationally and internationally <e> <s> it is important that its role should not be limited or stunted by an inability to develop a comprehensive archive <e>", "<cs> it is rather different <e> <s> the bfi archive covers a wider field <e> <s> it is both national and international <e> <s> it is like some museums <e> <s> it is the film museum of archives <e>", "<cs> i do not wish the minister to explain the amendment now <e> <s> but i wish to know whether it is one of the new amendments that were in the latest bunch <e>", "<cs> in that case presumably we shall have further explanation on that together with others during the progress of the bill <e>", "<cs> on behalf of myself and perhaps on behalf of all the gentlemen here <e> <s> i thank the minister for his kind words <e> <s> we reciprocate <e> <s> as bills go it has been a happy bill <e> <s> the only area in which i found the minister lacking was his great reluctance to accept any amendments that we put forward <e> <s> certainly he needs a good holiday as for a long time he had to deal with this bill in tandem with the hong kong legislation and there must have been considerable pressures on him despite the fact that he has more help than we do on these benches <e> <s> we appreciate his courtesy throughout the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the noble earls apology <e> <s> i would only add that the impartiality amendment which has caused the most trouble was promised on th july which gave nearly three months to finalise it <e> <s> however i accept that when the government set out to do the impossible it takes a long time <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that reply and explanation <e> <s> i do not find it very satisfactory <e> <s> the amendment is not proposing a large shopping list <e> <s> it simply has due regard to the cultural identity and diversity of the regions <e> <s> it aims to put on the face of the bill what the noble earl has said is there in any event <e> <s> however at the moment it does not cover the eventuality of the itc in future deciding to redraw the map <e> <s> i really must test the feeling of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble earl will remember in committee an amendment was proposed from this side that the itc should report to parliament with particular reference to the impact of the bill on the quality diversity and regional strength of programming <e> <s> that was to be a positive report which frankly we should have preferred <e> <s> nevertheless we are grateful that this consideration has been taken on hoard so to speak even though it will be a negative report on the licence holders if and when they have not fulfilled any of the licence conditions <e> <s> we are pleased that at least something has been done in relation to a matter about which we are most concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i well remember moving the amendment about control in committee <e> <s> the minister was good enough to say that he would take it away and come back with something at report as he has done <e> <s> i am a little concerned about the matter <e> <s> i do not have the committee debate in front of me but i pointed out that you could have control of less than per cent <e> <s> and still have control of the company <e> <s> the figure could be as low as per cent <e> <s> in some cases <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister answers perhaps i may say because this is a complicated question that my worry about the government amendment is that it refers to more than per cent <e> <s> of shares <e> <s> that would give you a majority holding anyhow <e> <s> i understood that the government were trying to produce an amendment about the point that i made in committee namely that you could have a controlling interest in certain circumstances when you had an interest of less than per cent <e> <s> the government amendment gives us more than per cent <e> <s> which would be a controlling interest in any case <e> <s> i do not think that it is very clear <e> <s> the concerns of the noble lord lord thomson and myself are genuine <e> <s> perhaps the minister will have another look at the matter because he was quite enthusiastic about it in committee <e> <s> the government amendment does not seem to meet quite the same point <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to say a few words on amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> this grouping is somewhat difficult in that we are covering more than one subject <e> <s> my noble friend will speak on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it seems that allowing non-ec nationals to own non-domestic satellite radio services without a substantial limit creates concern about whether we will be doing enough to promote european-based services as opposed to services from outside for instance from the united states <e> <s> like many other countries the united states imposes ownership restrictions on non-nationals and while the ec market should be opened up there is no obligation to extend that right to non-ec nationals <e> <s> i should like to hear the governments view on the promotion of european-based services <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is also concerned with this point <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister consider the matter again <e> <s> the position is very worrying <e> <s> it is unsatisfactory <e> <s> we have been asked to wait for subordinate legislation <e> <s> however the principle involved affects the mainstream legislation rather than the subordinate legislation <e> <s> i do not know how my noble friend lord thomson feels <e> <s> we are not happy with the provision <e>", "<cs> my lords my concern is very much that of the noble lord lord thomson of monifieth <e> <s> i should like to know further what the government mean by subordinate legislation within the context of the amendment <e> <s> i should like to have more specific information <e>", "<cs> my lords i put my name to this amendment not because i think it is necessarily a perfect solution but because it seems to be the best opportunity for achieving a consensus <e> <s> when we debated this issue in committee i moved the amendment on which we voted <e> <s> that amendment sought to require proprietors to divest themselves of ownership to bring the figure to per cent <e> <s> on that occasion i said <e>", "<cs> my lords having listened to what he said i agree entirely with the noble lord lord birkett <e> <s> there is nothing that i can add so i shall not take up the time of the house <e> <s> i hope that the government will look upon the amendment sympathetically <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the minister has taken that line <e> <s> words have different meanings that is the whole point of language <e> <s> it is a pity to be stuck with one word especially in view of what the noble lord lord thomson said in quoting the minister of state in another place who used the words significantly higher quality of programming <e> <s> there is a difference between significantly and substantial just as there is a difference between exceptional and particular <e> <s> it is strange that it is thought that the itc would be in some difficulty and unable to distinguish between these nuances which are so important <e> <s> i doubt whether that would be so but it does not appear that we can take the matter much further tonight so i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to see amendment no <e> <s> on the marshalled list because in committee we proposed an amendment to limit the time for which a channel licence holder could provide an adjacent service to a maximum of months <e> <s> at the time the minister replied that the provisions of clause were only intended to be temporary and that he would bring forward an amendment on report to clarify the position <e> <s> he has done that for which we are grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords it is late <e> <s> i should like an opportunity to read what the minister has said <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with the minister but it is quite clear that i shall not get very much further in the matter <e> <s> in the circumstances i shall not take up any more of the time of the house and accordingly i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not want to interrupt the minister in the middle of a sentence but i am a little puzzled and i should be pleased if he could answer me before he moves on <e> <s> he said a few minutes ago that i was wrong to point out that the provisions were restrictive that it was for the itc to interpret them <e> <s> the restriction lies in the duty imposed in such detail on the itc by the government <e> <s> if that is not so what is the point of putting the provision in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure where we are in this debate <e> <s> i merely want to say that in the circumstances i shall withdraw my amendment <e> <s> i am very pleased as we all are on these benches that the noble earl has decided to take back his amendment <e> <s> we can then look at the matter and make a decision <e> <s> i cannot give an undertaking to support the amended amendment on third reading but at least we can look at that matter and consider the position <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> the matter still remains open <e> <s> i should have thought that by now the government or the commission would have had something in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords are there party political broadcasts on breakfast television at present <e> <s> i never watch breakfast television <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that explanation it goes without saying that if there is a technical error in the amendment i should be grateful to have that put right if the amendment is accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite delighted that the minister has been able to accept the first amendment which is by far the most important of the two as it deals plainly and centrally with the concept of quality <e> <s> in that event i shall not move amendment no <e> <s> when we come to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the noble lord lord bonham-carter <e> <s> there is a real problem especially in rural and outlying regions because once the transmission is privatised the cost will be disproportionately high for many of those areas <e> <s> the amendment would help to guarantee maximum coverage for listeners in all areas and ensure this is <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to be quite clear on this matter <e> <s> the ministers amendment no <e> <s> and its consequentials were withdrawn while awaiting the new amendments which the government wish to put forward on third reading <e> <s> i want to be sure that there is nothing in the amendments which he has just moved regarding radio which is equal to the amendment withdrawn as regards television <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that explanation <e> <s> the amendments i have referred to are partially probing amendments <e> <s> in the light of that i shall beg leave to withdraw the amendments <e> <s> however if there is anything further that i wish to consider i shall return with a further provision on third reading <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment in general terms <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord lord airedale is right that there should be some way of ensuring that original creative material is produced rather than everything being bought in <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has pointed out a relevant issue and i should like to hear the ministers reply <e> <s> there could be a problem as regards coverage and it may be that the provision needs strengthening rather than leaving as it is <e> <s> there would be a weakening of the whole system <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself in a difficult situation <e> <s> one further question has arisen on the points i made <e> <s> what may sound extremely strange what has never happened before and what may never happen again is that if the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter is satisfied with the answers given by the minister i too may be satisfied <e> <s> the noble lord is much more a specialist on pensions than i and this is not a party political matter <e>", "<cs> my lords we are speaking of public bodies and parliament should certainly be informed <e> <s> i am sure that the other place would feel the same way <e> <s> the point has not been put before them because it has just entered this debate <e> <s> it will be contained in the lords amendments that go back to the commons <e> <s> i should like to feel that we shall receive an affirmative answer <e> <s> perhaps the minister will note my comments <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened carefully to everything that was said by the right reverend prelate and by the minister <e> <s> i do not know whether the right reverend prelate was referring to me when he said that the broadcasting standards council had been described as worthless <e> <s> i did not say that it was worthless <e> <s> i said that it was unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that it was quite unnecessary which may be interpreted in the same way <e> <s> i still believe that it was unnecessary and nothing has been said to change my mind <e> <s> i cannot believe that the right reverend prelate would go to the lengths and i hope that other members of the council would not do this either of asking somebody to write in if he thought that something was wrong <e> <s> if the right reverend prelate thought that something was wrong and if the right to initiate complaints was taken out of the bill he would have to accept that his judgment was not quite right <e> <s> he should accept that there should be a subjective judgment <e> <s> i should be very surprised and shocked if i thought that the right reverend prelate would play tricks like that <e> <s> i do not believe that he would do anything like that <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that there was no concern <e> <s> the noble baroness lady seear and i wanted the minister to explain on what basis he said that there was enormous concern around the country <e> <s> those were the words he used <e> <s> he has been unable to give us an answer <e> <s> we must accept that the council has been set up <e> <s> however the point made by the noble lord lord lloyd of hampstead is valid about this area of initiating complaints which is a very small and narrow part of the councils job <e> <s> if it has to take up complaints from other people then that is quite enough to keep it busy for some time <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i feel i should remind him that when the vote on the listed events took place it was won by the battalions on that side of the house who had not even heard what i and the minister had to say <e> <s> i do not think it had anything to do with reason <e>", "<cs> but how many times could the noble lord vote <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister explained the amendments today in a persuasive manner <e> <s> i am sure he is glad to come to the end of this difficult rocky road <e> <s> this is the third bite that we have had at this difficult and important subject <e> <s> we should remember today that the bill passed through the commons without any change in this area at all <e> <s> the minister in charge of the broadcasting bill in the commons made it clear in speeches both inside and outside the house that he thought it was quite wrong for parliament or government to interfere in laying down detailed codes of practice on impartiality for broadcasting authorities <e> <s> he made a much better case against what the government are trying to do today than many of those of us who are speaking against the measure now <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> i also wish to congratulate the noble lord lord lloyd of hampstead on his th birthday today <e> <s> i have always supported the proposal because for some years i too was a governor of the british film institute <e> <s> the noble lord lord lloyd has made all the points most strongly and there is little that i can add <e> <s> it appears to be anomalous to leave out channel and the domestic satellite services when other channels are included <e> <s> the commission has the right to determine the aggregate amount so nothing is fixed <e> <s> some of the channels are included in the statute and therefore it would be wrong to exclude others and to leave only some on a voluntary basis <e> <s> i support what my noble friend has said <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches may i first thank the noble earl for the extremely nice and pleasant things he has said not only about myself but about my colleagues on the front bench my noble friend lord ardwick and my noble friend lady ewart-biggs <e> <s> i should also like to thank a number of other noble lords who helped from time to time my noble friend lord peston who dealt late at night with the complicated problem of copyright together with the noble lord lord willis who kept us up very late but i am sure it was in a very good cause and the noble lord lord graham who behind the scenes was trying to help to arrange things for us all and the other whips who work with him <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not detain the house for more than a couple of minutes because i know that we want to get on <e> <s> sometimes when we are asked to vote we are divided in our minds as to how to proceed on certain questions <e> <s> i must point out to the noble lord lord renton that such a situation is not a constitutional matter <e> <s> as the second chamber we have an absolute right to send back an issue to the other place <e> <s> we are not doing anything unconstitutional at all <e> <s> we shall be exercising our right in an absolutely proper way <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl not agree that the action proposed is a take-over by sky rather than a merger <e> <s> does he also agree that it must result in less competition less choice and lower quality television for british viewers which is contrary to the governments intentions as stated in the white paper and in the broadcasting act <e> <s> was the prime minister aware of that when she obviously gave her blessing to mr murdoch <e>", "<cs> my lords i must return to part of the question to which the minister did not reply <e> <s> having read the papers and the reports on the matter and the acknowledgment from downing street that the subject was discussed with the prime minister is it right for anyone to draw the conclusion that if the prime minister had objected there would not have been an announcement some days later and that action would have been taken by the relevant ministers who were not informed <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us when the government intend to put before parliament the subordinate legislation promised during the passage of the broadcasting bill which would limit newspaper owners interests in domestic and non-domestic satellite services <e> <s> the delay is causing the iba great difficulty in dealing with bsbs breach of contract by its merger with sky <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord does not want to answer the second question i shall return to it on another occasion <e> <s> however with the greatest respect the first question is absolutely right and to the point <e> <s> is not the subordinate legislation meant to deal with the whole question of cross-media ownership and the monopoly situation <e> <s> for the minister not to answer a question on when the subordinate legislation is due to pass through parliament is in my view somewhat remiss <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i cannot accept the last answer given to me by the minister <e> <s> it is absurd to say that the subordinate legislation will be introduced within a year <e> <s> the iba is having to delay the decision it must make about bsb and whether it should withdraw the contract <e> <s> there are many people involved in this matter <e> <s> will the noble lord rethink his answer <e> <s> a decision is expected to be taken by parliament within the next few weeks and certainly before christmas <e> <s> surely he cannot really mean that it will be within a year <e>"]
