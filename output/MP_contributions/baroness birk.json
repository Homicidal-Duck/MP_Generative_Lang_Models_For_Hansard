["<cs> my lords as the minister has said and we know that the treasury is making more money available for this particular scheme is she taking into account what was said by several of her noble friends including the noble lord lord butler in the second reading debate that the money would be better used in helping to transport children to school <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not being in my place at the start of this report stage <e> <s> i should very much like to support the amendment put down by the noble lord lord reigate <e> <s> it is rather similar to the one that my noble friend lord donaldson of kingsbridge and myself put down in committee but it is rather tighter and neater <e> <s> it seems to cover various points made in committee <e> <s> the important aspect is that it explains what it is a memorial for <e> <s> it is practical enough to realise that when it comes to working the fund one is not going to be able to use this long title all the time <e> <s> it seems to me to be admirable and in view of what the minister has said i hope that we are going to have a happy concensus on this and that this amendment will be part of what i hope will soon be a statute <e>", "<cs> my lords i was waiting to hear what the noble lord the minister had to say in reply to the quite strong feeling expressed in the house <e> <s> i take his point very well first that consultation with the prime minister is <e>", "<cs> my lords as the amendment has not yet been withdrawn i should like a firm assurance from the noble lord in view of his refusal to accept this that the archaeological interest will go into the guidelines to the trustees and be drawn to the attention of their potential clients so that as far as possible there is no chance of some archeological object of great value to the heritage being missed because the word archaeological does not appear on the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords all i would say very briefly is thank you very much <e>", "<cs> my lords since my noble friend lord donaldson and i felt very strongly about this particular amendment which now enables the trustees to make loans as well as grants i think this is a tremendous improvement and i am very grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is rather a pity that the government will not accept that there could be some circumstances in which the trustees could be landed in a situation where it was vital for them to hold the property even for a short time <e> <s> i cannot imagine that the trustees and i accept that it is not their job would buy up property in the form of land or objects and hold on to it for even a short period <e> <s> however there is an outside chance and those of us who would like to see this provision inserted in the bill in some way feel that the amendment would take care of the odd eventuality instead of shutting the door completely <e> <s> i do not know whether the government would be prepared to look at the matter again <e>", "<cs> my lords in asking the minister a question may i say how delighted i was that he did not agree that there as an excessive burden at this stage because i believe this matter has been greatly exaggerated <e> <s> does he not agree that the greater london council offered hillingdon extra housing which it did not take up <e> <s> secondly does he not agree that in the recent case of the ethiopian woman and her child which has led to a great deal of publicity the court found that they were completely homeless without any other place of residence at all and they would presumably have had to be housed in some way by any local authority <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment to which i have put my name moved by my noble friend lord gibson for all the reasons which he drew out <e> <s> particularly i would like to associate myself with the remarks he made about museums <e> <s> the bill is extremely good in covering this point in part ii and clause is something which we welcome very much indeed <e> <s> but it is true that the point is not covered in part i it would make a very good balance if the government would accept this amendment and i hope the minister will <e> <s> in the unfortunate event of his not accepting it i should like to have firm assurances that the trustees will be given guidance on the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for moving this amendment because it is very much what we wanted <e> <s> it is a tremendous improvement and it covers a great deal of the ground that we have been concerned with regarding the significant associations of objects or collections with a particular place <e> <s> therefore i welcome it with great gratitude <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to hear the ministers assurances and his promise to enforce this by the beginning of april <e> <s> if by any unhappy unlikely and unfortunate chance not to do with your lordships house there is any delay do i assume that the interest on the capital will be paid <e> <s> this amounts to about a month and it would be disastrous if the fund did not get this right from the beginning <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened very carefully to what everybody has said including the noble lord the minister <e> <s> i am very sorry that the amendment has got this rather dusty reception <e> <s> i thought it was rather ingenious and i certainly hoped that it would be acceptable <e> <s> i do not think that there is any point <e>", "<cs> my lords i moved the amendmentit is mine and it has not been withdrawn <e> <s> i think i am in order and i shall go on until i am proved to be out of order <e> <s> as the minister has said the principle contained in this amendment has now been voted on several times <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend lord donaldson of kingsbridge that the tramp of the heavy feet of those who had not used their ears but who would march through the division lobby would make it a rather wasteful exercise <e> <s> therefore i shall with leave withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in supporting the amendment of my noble friend lord mishcon may i say that the noble lord lord belstead argued against the publication amendments saying that these were covered anyhow <e> <s> it sounded a complicated way <e> <s> i could not see then why it should not be clarified in the way these amendments clarify it <e> <s> the noble lord spoke of the local authority not making public their intention because it might worry people but if rumours are going round anyhow people are going to hear about it <e> <s> the local authority is not going to be able to keep this quiet <e> <s> in any case i cannot see why it should not report on the adequacy of the schools in the area when making changes and when we are talking about preventing local authorities from reducing the pro <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for that very full and courteous reply <e> <s> do not intend to press the amendments now <e> <s> i should like to have the opportunity to read carefully what the noble lord has said and decide between now and report stage what action to take <e> <s> i beg to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i agree that that explanation goes some way to meet these amendments and i do not think that we should pursue the matter further at this stage <e> <s> i thank the noble lord for his reply and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord <e> <s> if amendment no <e> <s> were carried then we would lose the reference to the secretary of state so it would need to be put in <e> <s> in view of what the noble lord has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>"]
