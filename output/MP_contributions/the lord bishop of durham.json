["<cs> my lords i should like to start with an apology to the noble lord lord nugent of guildford for the fact that i may not be able to wait for the end of the debate <e> <s> i had hoped to stay until the end but we are running rather slowly and i must catch the last train back to durham <e> <s> on the whole i welcome this report <e> <s> i like its general tone i respect the way in which it assesses such evidence as there is on the subject and with one major exception to which i shall come later and to which other members of the house have already referred i agree with most of its recommendations <e> <s> but i must confess to considerable anxiety about the section which lies at the heart of it the section on principles and in particular chapter to which the noble lord lord nugent of guildford has already referred <e> <s> that is the chapter about the general principles of law morality and freedom which are set out as a basis for the rest of the argument <e> <s> these principles are of course much wider in their significance than the particular topic of obscenity <e> <s> i hope that one of the effects of the report will be to focus attention on them and i intend to concentrate my remarks mainly on them <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel i must start by apologising for not having taken part in any of the previous debates on this bill or in the committee stage <e> <s> bishops have to cope with many conflicting demands on their time and especially when one lives a lone way from london as i do the difficulties of doing all that one might want to do in this house are almost insuperable <e> <s> however there are some advantages in being able to approach this subject afresh <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for raising that point to which i shall be coming in a moment <e> <s> but may i just for the moment reiterate the point that i was about to make namely that present circumstances have to take into account the enormous widening of the scope of this bill as a result of relatively easy divorce that when such legislation was first contemplated in the deceased wifes sisters bill the number of cases to which it could apply would be pretty small <e> <s> nowadays the field is many times larger <e> <s> but of course the question of the deceased wifes sister has been raised in earlier debates and noble lords have had some fun with the bill particularly the prophecies of ruin which were emphasised if the bill were to be passed <e>", "<cs> my lords with all due respect to the noble baroness it may be true of a step-child <e> <s> having myself been brought up in a family with step-children i know how close and intimate the relationship can become <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord sudeley is as we all know indefatigable <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg the pardon of the noble and learned lord the lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no knowledge of what further things have been done within the diocese of carlisle <e> <s> my point is simply that a diocesan newsletter is a forum for different news and views and it is surely not necessary for every view <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the parallels with what the noble earl has suggested are too perilous to pursue <e> <s> i do not want to press on <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he has any direct evidence to support that serious allegation <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for interrupting again but the noble lord is making so many extraordinary statements that i would be grateful if he would point to the place in my speech where i told this house that we must use the language of oxford street <e>", "<cs> my lords or anything equivalent <e> <s> would the noble lord please do me the courtesy of reading my speech in <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady wootton spoke with admirable brevity and i shall follow her example <e> <s> but i feel i owe it to your lordships to explain why even at this late stage those who sit on these benches feel they must oppose the bill <e> <s> we are grateful for the amendments which were passed we are sorry the amendment about the child of the family was not passed we greatly admire the tenacity with which the noble baroness has constantly defended her position and <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not fortunate enough to have personal knowledge of what goes on in australia <e> <s> i am simply arguing on the basis of what happens when one removes existing safeguards from the law <e> <s> we have seen it again and again in this country when so-called liberalising legislation passed with the best of intentions has put all kinds of ideas which were not there previously into the minds of all kinds of people <e> <s> i do not know what was or what is now in the minds of our friends in australia <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by expressing warm appreciation of the speech by the noble lord lord carrington and also much appreciation of his recent work in the middle east <e> <s> with great temerity i want to enter into the realm of middle east politics because during september i had the great privilege of being a member of a small british council of churches delegation which spent three weeks in lebanon syria jordan israel and egypt <e> <s> during that time we had an opportunity to meet political leaders in all the countries as well as religious leaders and many people in many walks of life including a midnight assignment with mr yasser arafat <e> <s> we also visited four camps for palestinian refugees two in lebanon one in the west bank and one in gaza <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to start by thanking the noble earl lord cathcart for giving us another opportunity to debate this vital subject <e> <s> since we discussed it in the debate on the gracious speech i have had the unusual privilege <e>", "<cs> my lords i was afraid that question would come <e> <s> it is not something which i have prepared for and i do not have documentation upon it <e> <s> i should not have said what i did had the noble viscount not made the point in his speech <e> <s> i can go back to my documents and try to satisfy him but i am afraid that i shall have to do so by writing to the noble viscount <e>", "<cs> my lords since this has been mentioned twice may i put the record straight <e> <s> the world council of churches hearing was planned first but the dutch churches had for a long time been contemplating a large demonstration at some time in the autumn <e> <s> the initiative to link the demonstration in amsterdam with the hearing was taken consciously by the dutch churches <e>", "<cs> my lords the lord bishop of london was hoping to speak in this debate as the leader of the debate in the general synod to which reference has already been made <e> <s> unfortunately he has flu and at the last moment i have been asked to substitute for him <e> <s> this means i fear that i shall have to leave before the end of the debate and i should like in advance to offer my apologies <e>", "<cs> my lords after a speech of that comprehensiveness and authority what is a poor bishop to do <e> <s> clergy are traditionally supposed to have a rather romantic attitude towards railways of the kind disavowed by the noble lord lord marsh <e> <s> i do not think that i have a romantic attitude towards them but i am conscious of serving a diocese which is steeped in railway history <e> <s> when i travel home from your lordships house i travel along the oldest railway route in the world at least part of it <e> <s> i now see that it also contains part of the newest railway system in this country <e> <s> i am also conscious as i speak that this afternoon there has been a mass lobby in another place by many people in my diocese living in the town of shildon whose railway works are threatened <e> <s> so where i come from railways are an emotional subject and this makes it all the more important to look for the basic principles on which decisions on this subject have to be made <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel sure as has already been very graciously indicated that i may rely on your lordships forbearance as i feel my way forward into sharing in the business of your lordships house <e> <s> my very real nervousness is checked only by my conviction of being able to rely on your collective graciousness and also by a sense of the importance of the matter we are now considering <e> <s> i should like to add my gratitude to the noble lord lord gregson for giving us an opportunity to consider this very important matter <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i hope it will not be thought impertinent of me as a very new boy in your lordships house if i add my respectful felicitations to the noble lord lord zouch of haryngworth for the very powerful and moving maiden speech which he has just made <e> <s> it is something on which we shall clearly all have total unanimity although it is a unanimity which i fear may not continue with regard to other details <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> it arrived today but i had already made the points for myself <e>", "<cs> my lords debates about the national health service and about the future of our social security system are bound most of the time to be about details <e> <s> we are anxious and some of us sometimes are angry about the way matters have developed particularly in individual cases or areas such as those referred to by the noble lord in the previous speech <e> <s> we are all very concerned about the decisions which need to be taken and which will be taken for the future <e> <s> clearly for example if we move into the area of the proposals in the green paper on reform of the social security system vital questions will arise such as at what cash level are the government proposing to move in implementing their various proposals for income support family credit social fund and so on <e> <s> alternatively what are the probable effects of those likely moves on certain groups of persons who are dependent on social security payments and who are the concern of particular pressure groups and specialist agencies like the family service units the citizens advice bureaux the child poverty action group and all the rest <e> <s> clearly much turns on the details <e> <s> therefore we must obtain detailed information we must have detailed reflection and we must take detailed decisions <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that i had said precisely that which the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has just said that it is no use expecting the type of employment which existed before <e> <s> i was trying to make the point that it is no use expecting full-time employment hours per week for years of a lifetime for a very large number of people in my diocese <e> <s> i was not suggesting that we should go backwards in any way <e>", "<cs> i hope that the amendment will either be pursued or that the government will undertake to consider the matter seriously <e> <s> we are in grave danger of being in cloud-cuckoo-land when we talk about principles and responsibilities even perhaps when we talk about proportional representation <e> <s> we are talking about people <e>", "<cs> may i just say that i am not against responsibility <e> <s> i am against people who already have satisfactory incomes if not income support expecting to exact responsibility from people who already are so battered that they have no chance to be responsible about anything <e>", "<cs> that is the problem <e> <s> it is quite easy if it is concerned with magistrates or recognised things <e> <s> i can assure the committee from experience specially of my wife locally with volunteers who are trying to do jobs which are of value in the community but which would not be establishedly <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord dean of beswick for providing this opportunity before we go into recess to register with the government some points to which we believe ministers need to pay attention as they go ahead with various initiatives in the inner cities <e> <s> i am grateful also for the opportunity that is thus presented to me to say on behalf of my fellow bishops and indeed perhaps on behalf of the general synod of the church of england how glad we are that the government have made that very important declaration of intent about the inner cities <e>"]
