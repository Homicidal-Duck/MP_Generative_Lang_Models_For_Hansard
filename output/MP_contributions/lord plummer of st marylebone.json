["<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend lord balfour of inchrye for enabling me to join in this debate <e> <s> i enter into it with some caution as the subject of central inner london congestion has been a matter of contention for a very long time <e> <s> as the noble lord lord underhill remarked a prime minister was forced to comment upon this on another occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to rise and support the words of my noble friend lord mottistone <e> <s> indeed i support wholeheartedly what the noble lord lord marsh has said <e> <s> at the time of our negotiations which i must say i enjoyed very much i was urged to accept a per cent <e> <s> write-off of london transports debt <e> <s> but i pursued the matter with some opposition from the noble lord lord marsh to the point where we got per cent <e> <s> i do not think that that was in fact a very clever thing to do because it brings me to the point that local government and indeed the very efficient local government officers are not really trained by reason of their profession to deal with a commercial undertaking <e> <s> on the night when the noble lord lord marsh and i finally agreed terms i remember saying that i thought we ought to have a very much greater write-off than the per cent <e> <s> which in fact we got and that was because it was not being looked at as a commercial undertaking but was merely being looked at with the eyes of local government <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that recent events may well persuade the government that in the control of subsidies they may well be advised to take it back into their hands in order to see that the money is well spent <e> <s> i should mention that in the days when mrs castle was persuading the glc to take over london transport she offered an alternative which was a passenger transport authority <e> <s> that would have had the power to precept on the ratepayer but the ratepayer would have had no recourse as to the amount that the pta asked <e> <s> we thought that this would merely create what i would call another ilea in london and would be the worst of all worlds <e> <s> therefore very reluctantly indeed with the pistol at our heads we proceeded with the negotiations to take it over <e>", "<cs> my lords i too have to declare an interest <e> <s> i am chairman of the horserace betting levy board which is the freeholder of epsom downs and the leaseholder of walton downs <e> <s> secondly i am chairman of the epsom and walton downs training grounds management board which is responsible for the gallops on the downs <e> <s> that the levy board is directly involved in epsom and walton downs is due in very great measure to my predecessor the noble lord lord wigg who when chairman of the levy board of course did so much to assist the development of the downs <e> <s> the racing and training industries really owe him a very great debt of gratitude <e> <s> i should like as others have done to pay tribute and to record how much the present levy board appreciates the contribution that he has made in the past <e> <s> therefore i support the amendment which i think is crucial to racing and training at epsom <e> <s> but i think i must content myself by saying that the noble lord lord wigg perhaps strayed rather further from the facts in regard to what he said about aintree and some other irrelevant matters <e>", "<cs> in case it should be thought that my noble friend the minister is a lone <e>", "<cs> my lords in any arrangements that are made for the devolution of powers to the london boroughs association will my noble friend consider that this is not an executive body and in the past has not been able to agree among its members on action in the overall interests of greater london due to the fact that what suits one borough does not suit another <e>", "<cs> i give way to nobody in my admiration when i hear the lawyers start to dissect the legal interpretation of various words in the bill <e> <s> it throws a slight shudder down my spine because maybe the noble lord lord mcintosh takes the somewhat cynical view which i do although he has been rather closer to this problem than i have when operating the london transport authority under the greater london council <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord young of dartington has raised some very interesting points and for the most part it could be said some very critical points in regard to the building societies <e> <s> in view of his great experience in consumer affairs i think it is important that we should study these very carefully <e> <s> first i should declare an interest in that i am chairman of a building society and i am also president of the metropolitan association of building societies <e>", "<cs> my lords in years of experience i have never met a situation such as the noble lord describes <e> <s> i think it would be true to say that form ar which has to be submitted to the registrar annually clearly calls upon the members of boards to disclose anything of that nature <e> <s> it is unfortunate that the noble lord has totally failed to give any evidence of his serious allegation of vested interests influencing decisions <e> <s> if he continues to make criticisms of that sort he should bring forward facts <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness lady burton of coventry sits down i believe she has drawn me to my feet and so i will confirm to her quite seriously that i truly believe there should be equal opportunity for people to become directors of societies <e> <s> a proper channel for this must be worked out <e> <s> as regards who should be head of the household i am absolutely amazed that this problem should exist certainly it never exists in my own society <e>", "<cs> as possibly the only member of your lordships committee who has for some time appointed the present board of london transport perhaps in the light of my experience i may speak in support of the noble lord the minister <e> <s> when i came to appoint the board of london transport i had very much in my mind that those who were appointed should show a capability in transport industrial commercial financial or administrative matters <e> <s> i am not sure about applied science or the organisation of workers <e> <s> that was very <e>", "<cs> i should like to support what has already been said by my noble friends lord mottistone and lord peyton <e> <s> the fact is that members of this board are a large commercial organisation <e> <s> if pressures are brought to bear as i have experienced myself with the present london transport to have special interest groups represented on the board where do you stop <e> <s> you will not need a football team <e> <s> you will need a rugby football team to accommodate all the people who feel that they deserve a place on the corporation <e> <s> it is clear to me that the place for someone to look after the special interests of the disabled is on the london regional passengers committee where they can bring to bear all their influence in seeing that special needs are met within the financial constraints <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord underhill argues that the proceedings of the corporation should be open to the public and he brings into his argument the fact that the corporation is similar to a nationalised industry <e> <s> does this mean that the proceedings of say the national coal board are therefore to be brought into the open and attended by the public in regard to every way in which they make their decisions <e> <s> the whole thing is perfectly ludicrous <e> <s> one cannot run a corporation of this size with the public present at every meeting <e> <s> i believe that this amendment should be rejected <e>", "<cs> i must say that i am disappointed in the answer given by my noble friend the minister <e> <s> if we are going to work towards an integrated public transport system in london surely there is no harm in inserting the words of the amendment <e> <s> the noble baroness lady denington will remember the difficulties that we had with what i think were then called the green line buses which criss-crossed london and lacked co-ordination with the remainder of the transportation system <e> <s> i should have thought that it was almost essential for this to be put into paragraph if only to obtain the degree of co-ordination which is absolutely necessary to an integrated public transport system in london <e>", "<cs> it would be helpful to me if the meaning of the words for the time being were explained <e> <s> do they mean that we are only expected to have a transportation system which best suits the needs of greater london for the time being <e> <s> surely what we want is something for the future as well <e> <s> one would hope that this new body would be working towards this <e> <s> frankly i find the wording of the bill rather better than the wording of the amendment but that opinion is subject to what explanation can be given <e>", "<cs> i must say that what my noble friend the minister has just said makes very good common sense <e> <s> when holding some responsibility for london transport the special needs of various areas for heavy loss-making bus lines and so on were constantly pressed upon one and one has to deal with the best needs of the whole area <e> <s> if some particular locality requires a special bus or some form of transportation to meet its special needs then i am sure it can be arranged for that borough to put forward the finance to meet the needs that it has in that area <e>", "<cs> i am interested that the labour party are raising these objections <e> <s> they are really saying that if we make a profit it should go back into the undertaking <e> <s> i seem to remember that on a previous occasion when london transport was taken over by the greater london council and we ran the undertaking at a surplus for two years we were castigated because we actually made a surplus <e> <s> we were said to be depriving the people of london of lower fares because we were making a surplus <e> <s> that surplus i may say was only about on a turnover of say million <e> <s> but nevertheless that was the argument <e> <s> now we are told that if we have a surplus it is wicked for it to go back into the kitty and that something must be done about it <e> <s> i find the argument wholly fallacious <e>", "<cs> i should perhaps have made myself clear <e> <s> when i say kitty the government are providing the bulk of the money and that is the kitty in my opinion <e>", "<cs> we are talking about normal accounting practices and a great deal of play has been made of a statement in tonights edition of the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank the noble lord the minister my noble friend lord bellwin for the way in which over the past few weeks he has courteously answered my requests for information <e> <s> in past years we have soldiered together in local government and to coin a phrase we were worthy people doing worthy things together <e> <s> i am sorry that i have to disagree with much of what he has said today <e> <s> one of the difficulties of opposing this bill is that there is a danger that one might be thought to be supporting the actions of the labour party at county hall and the expensive spate of propaganda which has flowed from there <e> <s> their lunatic and wasteful policies have been and are an abuse of authority <e> <s> again and again there has been an arbitrary use of power by a political authority in areas where they have no authority <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say a few words <e> <s> when i was leader of the glc i took london transport into the reluctant arms of the glc but i never felt that it was absolutely right that it should be kept there <e> <s> i believe that in the end this bill will make an improvement to london transport and that the staff of london transport together with the managerial staff who have been constantly interfered with over a number of years will now have the opportunity to see that the undertaking runs in the right way <e> <s> now that the government have the responsibility for public transport i hope that it will be accompanied by improvements to the road system in london <e> <s> i congratulate the ministers on the way in which this bill has gone through <e>", "<cs> i have not agreed with every paragraph or detail of this bill but this particular clause i regard as absolutely essential to the transitional arrangements <e> <s> one has only to look at ones postbag over the last days to a month to see the number of people who have appealed to you to retain the glc in its present stage and to know when reading the reason why they want it retained that it is because they are one of a number of freeloaders freeloaders who have had money given to them by the glc which they never should have had <e> <s> the glc labour administration in county hall at the moment has shown an irresponsibility in dealing with this discretionary allowance which has never been experienced by any previous administration at county hall either labour or conservative <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl would like someone to interrupt him perhaps i may do so <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that the despondency and despair of the voluntary bodies has been encouraged by the labour party whose members go around spreading these stories and causing a great deal of unnecessary anxiety <e> <s> the noble earl comes here in the middle of the debate without knowing what has been said and carries on with this entirely fallacious argument <e>", "<cs> my lords last year we had the cart of the paving bill <e> <s> this year we have the horse in the shape of the local government bill not a stallion capable of regenerating greater london and with a single driver but sadly a gelding with a prospect of drivers who have opposing views as to the direction in which it should be steered <e>", "<cs> i strongly support the amendment moved by my noble friend lord hayter to which i have also put my name <e> <s> the overwhelming need for a london metropolitan authority is i submit irresistibly demonstrated by the bill itself and is supported by every non-political and professional organisation which is concerned with greater londons administration <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down <e>", "<cs> can he explain why then the planning process which he is putting forward as the best one under this bill has been largely condemned by all the professional associations including the london green belt council <e> <s> in regard to waste disposal this has also been said by the association of county councils to be unworkable <e>", "<cs> the answers given by my noble friend the minister indicate once again how little thought has gone into how this whole thing will work <e> <s> at this stage they are unable to give an answer and we are less than a year from the enactment of the bill <e> <s> i should also like to know from where and what sort of people in london the members of this london planning commission will be drawn <e> <s> will they go round london holding public meetings to find out what the people of london feel about these strategic plans which they intend to impose upon the boroughs <e> <s> will they consult the boroughs <e> <s> the minister chose a particularly bad example when he asked what tower hamlets and kingston have in common <e> <s> i think he will find that londons biggest route runs through both of them the thames <e>", "<cs> this is exactly what we shall not get <e> <s> the london boroughs will give a view about their own cabbage patches <e> <s> they will not have regard for the rest of london or if they do they will only have regard for the immediately adjoining borough <e> <s> what we want is a plan that considers london as a whole <e>", "<cs> in order that i may say at least one word on behalf of the bill before us i think that i would support my noble friend lord campbell of alloway in this <e> <s> having been involved in <e>", "<cs> we are urged not to take a pessimistic view of the ability of the london boroughs to come together to deal with bulk waste disposal <e> <s> for those us who have been in local government for a long time i can safely say i believe that we have seen it all before <e> <s> it did not work then and it will not work now <e> <s> before the formation of the glc waste disposal was the responsibility of the london borough councils <e> <s> the result was chaotic <e> <s> a hotch-potch of arrangements deriving from a multiplicity of diverse standard small authorities proved that it was costly inefficient haphazard environmentally unsound and unplanned <e>", "<cs> i supported the abolition of the glc because i recognised that it was in need of reform <e> <s> but i am solely concerned to ensure that the arrangements which follow shall be as efficient as those which have gone before <e>", "<cs> as i understand it that includes civil defence and perhaps i may say that the home office memorandum relating to this also contains some unrealistic proposals <e> <s> illogically the greater london councils discretionary responsibilities and statutory duties for contingency planning for major emergencies and natural disasters in peacetime are to be laid on the shoulders of london boroughs <e> <s> i heard the noble lord lord renton when he made a case for providing expertise <e>", "<cs> it is separated in certain ways which i find unrealistic <e> <s> for instance paradoxically the preparations for war emergency planning which i hope are less likely to require implementation are to be undertaken by the new london authority whereas planning for major accidents which are more likely to occur and would be no respecter of borough boundaries is to be devolved to the london boroughs which lack the expertise the resources or the strategic overview necessary for the effective co-ordination of all aspects of emergency planning and its implementation <e>", "<cs> i was unable to vote for amendment no <e> <s> e because i felt that it lumped together too many things in one place which to be truthful were not compatible <e> <s> the situation in london is very different <e> <s> to give some idea of the number of parks and other activities which it is proposed to transfer to the london boroughs it would be useful to give in broad outline and briefly what is involved for those who may not be aware of the size of the problem <e>", "<cs> will my noble friend allow me just to explain this <e> <s> i did not say that i wanted the royal parks to be taken over by the glc <e> <s> i merely commented that somebody else said that <e>", "<cs> i wish to express my concern for the staff of the glc and the way they are to be treated in this giant upheaval <e> <s> the greatest asset that any organisation has is its staff and it is very important that they should be fairly treated <e> <s> it is not their fault speaking of the glc in particular that they have irresponsible masters who appear to have prevented them from opening these discussions to which the noble lord referred <e>", "<cs> i should be very happy to do so <e>", "<cs> during the course of this bill ministers have on numerous occasions referred to the transfer of the glcs housing stock of a few years ago as proof that the glc no longer has a role in housing but in reality it still has a wide range of housing functions <e> <s> it has lost virtually no housing powers and as the noble baroness lady birk has already mentioned it still handles the largest capital housing programme in the country <e> <s> i must point out that to a large degree these programmes are carried out in pursuit of new responsibilities imposed on the greater london council in the early s as part of the order transferring its homes to the boroughs <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend the minister sits down i should like to be clear as to exactly what he is proposing <e> <s> it is difficult to take it in at short notice <e> <s> i understood him to say that the london boroughs association would put foreward views with the aid of a modest staff <e> <s> did he use those words <e> <s> who is going to pay for this modest staff <e> <s> what new bureaucracy is being set up among all the other various bureaucracies to which we seem to be giving birth all around london <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend the minister say which particular areas of london will be dealt with by the city action teams and what funds will be made available to them for this purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend carries on to another point can he explain the last part of subsection which says <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought there would be a warm welcome for improving the physical environment of the people living in notting hill and north peckham <e> <s> but there are other vast areas of london where the housing conditions are deteriorating rapidly because the houses there were all built about years ago <e> <s> from my own experience in dealing with these matters i should have thought a sum of million would be just a drop in the ocean towards solving the problem which exists in the inner areas of london <e>", "<cs> my lords as i sat on the court of london university for some years may i reinforce what has been said about the impossible task that it has in the allocations that it has been given <e> <s> is the noble baroness aware that the effect of the ugc decision if it is a decision is to cut the budget of birkbeck college by more than per cent <e> <s> million out of million <e> <s> is she also aware that most of the students there have got on their bikes to get a job and they then get on their bikes to improve their education and skills <e> <s> will she please bring pressure to bear to relieve the college of that impossible burden <e>", "<cs> i hope that this amendment will be rejected <e> <s> i should perhaps first declare an interest in that i am chairman of a building society and i am also president of the metropolitan association of building societies <e>", "<cs> i must say that i am not altogether clear <e> <s> can my noble friend say whether or not the commission has the power to delegate the making of orders or regulations by statutory instrument <e>", "<cs> i urge caution on this point <e> <s> as i think was said just now it is easy as has been seen for a run on a bank to start <e> <s> the commission will have to be careful about what it reports in that respect <e> <s> i shall not go into detail but i can think of several circumstances where it might prove detrimental to the society concerned without there being good reason <e>", "<cs> perhaps consultation with <e>", "<cs> i think it should be fully realised that if time is not made for this it will severely restrict the ability of building societies to compete in the market <e> <s> this is a serious consequence for those of us who are at the sharp end of earning our living and i think we must really appeal for further time to see this bill through <e> <s> there are a great number of people moving into the mortgage market and if the building societies are unable to have the powers this bill would give it will tie their hands behind their backs <e>", "<cs> i should not like the crude truth of the noble lord lord houghton to be thought the normal in the appointment of directors <e> <s> in my experience the appointment of directors is carefully gone into <e> <s> several candidates are brought forward and after a period of examination and consideration they are very carefully selected <e> <s> the professional experience they bring forward is also considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord wyatt of weeford for introducing this bill which i wish to support <e> <s> may i take this opportunity to add my congratulations to the two maiden speakers the noble lord lord fairhaven and the noble viscount lord head on their excellent speeches <e>", "<cs> my lords in the interests of accuracy the noble lord said that he believed there were no off-course betting shops in france <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord will find that the biggest bet in france which is the <e>", "<cs> i find great unreality in these arguments because my experience of going round london on sundays is that the shopping centres are thronged with people going to the shops and buying goods in large quantities <e> <s> do they create dirt confusion and so on <e> <s> what difference will it make if there is a betting shop open <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome this statement <e> <s> i was nominally responsible for ilea for some three years and perhaps i am the only member of this house to have held such a position <e> <s> i can confirm that when we took over ilea it was then as now cumbersome and excessively costly <e> <s> it had an ability to spend at an enormous rate and at the same time operated with an inflated staff level which was totally unreasonable <e> <s> like the glc ilea has brought about its own doom by poor financial controls petty policies and more importantly by sending pupils from poor and deprived areas out into the world with a poor education <e> <s> this situation must be ready for reform and i hope that the government will press forward with it <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to attack the main principles of the bill <e> <s> however as a westminster ratepayer i feel that the minister must be more explicit on how it will affect the city council <e> <s> in the absence of further details on how the needs grant will be allocated there is no doubt in my mind that the westminster city council will be worse off <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say how many unoccupied and unused dwellings there are in local government hands <e>", "<cs> my lords what steps will the government take to improve the traffic conditions in york road as it is evident that the development will create a great deal more activity and that there will be an increase in passenger traffic at waterloo by reason of the channel tunnel <e>"]
