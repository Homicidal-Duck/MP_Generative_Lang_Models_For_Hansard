["<cs> my lords i hope i may begin by thanking the noble lord lord ezra for his very kind references to myself <e> <s> i also congratulate him not only for a singularly lucid powerful and comprehensive speech but also for his impeccable sense of timing in introducing this debate in a week when herr pohl of the bundesbank has issued or perhaps reissued a pressing invitation to this country to become a full member of the ems when our own governor of the bank of england has stressed the need for convergence in banking regulations and when my noble friend lord young of graffham has indicated his support for emphasis on the internal market during the german presidency of the ec <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by adding my congratulations to those that have already been offered to the noble earl who has introduced this most interesting debate in which such a wealth of experience has already been deployed <e> <s> the th report of the council covers many aspects of country life but like many other speakers i want to concentrate my brief intervention on its conclusions concerning forestry <e> <s> in so doing i must declare an interest as the owner of a small and modest acreage of woodlands and also as chairman of a forestry company <e>", "<cs> my lords i come from the county of monmouthshire now called gwent <e> <s> i have and i have planted in such country <e> <s> i have observed the kind of standards that i have been presumptuous enough to enjoin on the house <e> <s> no i have not been to the flow country <e> <s> yes i have read the <e>", "<cs> i hope i may briefly intervene on this particular amendment in the light of the insidiously attractive arguments advanced by the noble lords lord ezra and lord diamond <e> <s> there may be a case for supporting the coal industry as a whole and even a case for supporting an individual pit on social grounds but i shall not detain the house by debating the merits of that particular proposition <e> <s> however what i do suggest to the committee is that it would be quite wrong that a major subsidy such as has been suggested either in the coal industry as a whole or to an individual pit should be borne by the electricity industry by means of an uneconomic pricing policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my thanks to the noble lord lord carter for initiating this debate which gives us our first opportunity to debate the budgetary proposals and the measures which accompanied them <e> <s> i am ready immediately to declare my personal interest as a woodland owner on a modest scale i hope that this will not disturb the noble baroness lady white in the principality and also as chairman of a forestry management company <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall address my brief remarks to an environmental assessment of the afforestation regulations <e> <s> my noble friend the minister has moved the regulations with his customary lucidity and charm and i cannot say that i am moved to anger as noble lords opposite appear to have been <e> <s> i have however been a little anxious on a variety of scores <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to add my thanks to the noble lord lord blake for initiating this debate <e> <s> it has of course covered a very well tilled field but it is a field capable of yielding many crops and one to which we should return regularly <e> <s> there have been notable interventions <e> <s> i shall single out two of them because they touched on public expenditure for which for some years i had some slight responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has indeed been successful there <e> <s> but nevertheless i think that demonstrates a remarkable british solution to a delicate and sensitive problem <e>", "<cs> my lords as a life member of the national trust i am grateful to have been put right and to have had some of my anxieties at least <e>", "<cs> as one would expect the amendment was moved very attractively by the noble lord lord williams of elvel <e> <s> nonetheless i believe that it is misconceived <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> as he has referred directly to my point i hope that he will allow me to put this proposition surely in any contested takeover the chairman of the company under threat would automatically request one of his friends in either house to ask the minister of the day whether he would state on what grounds he believes that the public interest is not involved in that particular case <e>", "<cs> my lords i enter this debate with some diffidence as unlike many other noble lords who have contributed to it my qualifications are rather limited <e> <s> although i have been a regular visitor to the victoria and albert museum during my adult life unlike other noble lords i have never been involved in the administration of that great institution nor do i know many of the personalities involved <e> <s> however i am a member of the court and council of another museum which is happily not faced with quite the same range of problems <e>", "<cs> my lords certain slighting comments were made i think that that was the implication by the noble lord and other noble lords of the qualifications of those with a business background to sit among the trustees <e> <s> i should have thought that business people frequently have to deal with the practical consequences of the contraction or takeover of a business <e> <s> if i have misinterpreted what the noble lord said i shall very readily withdraw <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be that the thrust of the noble lords remarks was not directed at any particular commercial qualification <e> <s> however i believe that he was fairly brutal in his condemnation of the intellectual qualifications of the trustees over whom the noble lord lord armstrong has to preside <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage of the debate i regret that i cannot be as brief as the noble lord who has just sat down i congratulate him on the brevity of his intervention <e> <s> i shall confine my intervention solely to the green paper <e>", "<cs> my lords even though the government are not prepared to contemplate a specific exemption for the principal home can the minister say whether in fixing the threshold they will at least take into account the value of the <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend recognise that last years ill-considered measures have damaged long-term confidence in forestry <e> <s> does he also recognise that the statistics with which he will no doubt be furnished in due course are based largely on application for grant but that not all applications are translated into planting <e> <s> will he therefore against that background use his considerable influence with his colleagues in government and with the forestry commission to ensure that the planting applications are handled <e>", "<cs> my lords if as seems likely actual planting as opposed to grant applications which are always notoriously an unreliable guide to such matters falls short it seems likely to fall far short of the governments figures what measures will they propose to restore confidence in this much battered area of economic activity <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what my noble friend has told the house about proposed sales of forestry commission land and against the background of the governments proclaimed planting targets can he tell the house what thought has been given by the government to encouraging new forms of investment in forestry particularly by small investors <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great pleasure for me to follow the noble lord lord diamond since both he and i have in our times had some responsibility for public expenditure which nearly always has a bearing on our debates on the economy <e> <s> however he advanced three propositions with two of which i most violently disagree <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite entitled to make both points <e> <s> i spoke about the selective choice of periods and it was to correct the decade of which as i said the first three years were rendered a little rough or tough at the treasury by <e>", "<cs> i suspect that my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor faces in this debate a somewhat delicate dilemma <e> <s> if to assuage the legitimate anxieties that have been expressed by almost every speaker in this debate he tells us that the committee is only an advisory committee and that its advice can and will be regularly overriden we can dismiss the establishment of the committee as a delicate political charade and we can pack our bags and go home <e> <s> however my next point is perhaps another dimension of the point made so forcibly by my noble and learned friend lord hailsham if he tells us that he will find it extremely difficult to find people of weight and experience to serve on the advisory committee <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord sits down he may recall that i put a question to him before i concluded <e> <s> i should be most grateful if he could give me an answer <e> <s> will he tell the committee which other professions are regulated by a committee dominated by laymen <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord jenkins of hillhead introduced the debate with a character istically agreeable speech <e> <s> i find it a little surprising to see him cast himself in the role of savonarola <e> <s> there are no doubt many facets to his character <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will give way on that point <e> <s> i am grateful to him for his illuminating address on the question of the act to which i also referred <e> <s> is he suggesting that the secretary of state could introduce an order with retrospective effect which would enable him to initiate action before the court the decision is ultimately that of the court against the fayeds on the basis of what happened some years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a little diffident about inflicting a further intervention at this stage since many points have been made so admirably in the course of a debate of high quality <e> <s> i cannot speak with quite the same first-hand experience as the noble earl has revealed either from nuremberg or on previous constitutional changes in this field <e> <s> however in case there should be any disagreements here or in another place it is important that we should attempt to demonstrate that there are deeply held and clearly thought out views in this house on this highly controversial issue <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down will he be so kind as to answer one question which arises from the first point he made for looking with disfavour on the amendment <e> <s> let us suppose that at <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has not fallen short of his normal standard of courtesy but he has if he will allow me to say so fallen short of his normal standard of perceptive appreciation of what is being moved <e> <s> i am not asking for any favours for any one applicant <e> <s> all applicants will be tendering on the same basis all in the knowledge that if for any year they were unable to recoup their capital outlay a nil percentage would be specified <e> <s> there would be fairness <e> <s> i take his point about the provision spilling over into other parts of the bill <e> <s> i have to say i hope with suitable diffidence and humility that it may be that other parts of the bill deserve closer consideration but it is not for me to suggest that to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may correct one point <e> <s> it would be mandatory only for whoever tendered and whose application was successful in the event of him being unable to recoup by a fairly rigid definition his capital outlay <e> <s> in view of the courteous words of my noble friend the minister and in the hope that we may be able to find common ground before report stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>"]
