for a little more international co-operation in this field <e>", "<cs> my lords as i live in the north york moors national park and as i was abroad during the committee stage perhaps i may say a few words <e> <s> the noble lord lord craigton and the noble viscount lord ridley both mentioned the figure of acres which were converted between and <e> <s> as the noble lord lord derwent knows this was mostly an area of poor moorland most of which was planted by the forestry commission and some of which went to farming <e> <s> i should like to correct any impression that there may be that at the

craigton referred in front of me works out at acres per year <e> <s> between and it has slowed down to acres a year and the rate at the present time is acres per year which is slightly less than per cent <e> <s> of the total moorland area <e>", "<cs> i should like to withdraw the amendment at this stage but to reserve the right if necessary to bring it up at a later stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i

been expressed on all sides of the house i hope that the government will agree to look again at the matter <e> <s> if the noble earl will agree to do so i shall be very pleased to withdraw the amendment at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords on that understanding i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to join in thanking the government <e> <s> perhaps i could remind the house that our original amendment on which this is based was designed to create barrier-free access to new public buildings in order to put some teeth into the act which was a very good act but there was no means of enforcing it <e> <s> we hope that by putting the onus on the developer to show that it is not reasonable or practicable to provide access this new amendment will just achieve that <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by offering an apology on behalf of my noble friend lady darcy de knayth who is unable to be present because she is attending a family funeral <e> <s> i know that she would support some of my remarks if she were able to be present <e> <s> this is a small bill <e> <s> perhaps one might liken it to a small child and in saying that i want to pay tribute to the enormous amount of hard work that has already been devoted to the bill in another place <e> <s> however i should like to ask the government whether they are satisfied that this bill is the best bill that can be produced for disabled people at this time <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord campbell of croy who has just spoken i too would like to join in thanking

may i <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> i experience the same kind of difficulties that have been described <e> <s> as the noble baroness said it would be of benefit not only to the disabled but also the elderly and those who push prams and trolleys <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> as the noble lord lord chelwood has just said we are talking about a much more serious offence than an ordinary parking offence <e> <s> it may mean that a disabled person will just have to go away and forgo whatever plan he or she had at that time <e> <s> if there were a notice and a heavier fine it would be most helpful <e>", "<cs> i should very much like to support this amendment <e> <s> obviously there is a great deal of common sense in maintaining the differential <e>", "<cs> i support what the noble baroness lady masham said <e> <s> i remember driving along a major road and coming across a place with a disabled sign displayed it was a lavatory for the disabled but with a step down about six inches and that of course made the whole thing pointless <e>", "<cs> i should also like to welcome this amendment and to thank the government most sincerely

the marshalled list there are the words <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the widespread interest in access for the disabled will the minister consider publishing a list of the buildings that are to be altered and the time-scale <e> <s> can he also confirm that the national railway museum at york which has extensive projects for disabled people is included in this scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble baroness for her reply may i ask her whether she agrees with the noble earl lord mansfield who said <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> kerbs are a great hindrance to people in wheelchairs and one day if i do not turn up in your lordships house it may be because i have met with an accident on one of these kerbs <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord winstanley for what he has said and also to the noble baroness lady young <e> <s> with the leave of the house i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should just like to say a word about access officers <e> <s> this point arose in the local government miscellaneous provisions scotland bill but has not actually arisen here <e> <s> as your lordships may know in scotland all but two local authorities have designated access officers <e> <s> i feel it is very important that there should be a person on every local authority with responsibility for access problems <e> <s> i should like to quote from what was said by the noble earl lord mansfield when he addressed your lordships house on th june <e>", "<cs> i should also like to support this amendment <e> <s> i believe that integration where possible is the best answer <e> <s> i think that i was one of the first fully disabled students to go up to oxford university after the war <e> <s> i count myself very fortunate indeed to have been able to do that <e> <s> i would have suffered if i had had to go to some special institution elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he is aware that the problem has been solved at dartmouth in devon <e> <s> this has been done by constructing a ramp parallel to the front of the post office curving into the entrance and closed in so that it is protected from the weather and does not become slippery and it is provided with handrails so that it is suitable for the ambulant disabled as well as for the wheelchair disabled <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like also briefly to support this amendment <e> <s> it seems to me the parents need to know of every possible supportive organisation and the authority could indeed indicate which of the organisations concerned they thought would be most helpful in the particular case concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask your lordships two questions <e> <s> the first one is do <e>", "<cs> my lords i have only one question to ask the minister <e> <s> will he take a fresh look at the request by ira prisoners who are in prisons in this country to be transferred to prisons in northern ireland so that their families can visit them without long and expensive journeys <e> <s> family visits to those who are in prison must be an essential lifeline <e> <s> i feel that this is something which should not be made difficult without very careful study <e> <s> it is not only the prisoners themselves but their families also who are being penalised <e> <s> i understand that for this reason british soldiers convicted of offences in northern ireland serve their sentences in this country <e> <s> may i ask the minister to ask his right honourable friend the home secretary to have a second look at this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to take the opportunity to express my gratitude to the minister for telling us that an amendment will be introduced at the committee stage to exempt orange badge holders from having their cars clamped under clause of the bill

badge system <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> i would like to support this amendment having put my name to it <e> <s> after a prisoner has been inside for several years it will not do him any good to

support the amendment from the point of view of maintaining hope and allowing personal contact with a member who will make the recommendation <e>", "<cs> my lords i would like to start by thanking the

bench <e> <s> your lordships may remember that in when the chronically sick and disabled persons bill was introduced here by the noble earl three of us here all made our maiden speeches under his aegis <e>", "<cs> my lords i would only remind the house if i may of the total number of abortions undergone by women residents of the united kingdom since it now stands at <e> <s> that is nearly double the total number of united kingdom <e>", "<cs> in supporting this amendment may i just remind the minister of the undertaking given by dr vaughan in that if money for building the new spinal

list of various allowances that my noble friend has just mentioned <e> <s> this allowance too is given for a specific purpose <e> <s> will it be excluded <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister give consideration to the case of sean odocherty a young man who has publicly renounced violence broken with the ira and apologised to all his victims <e>", "<cs> my lords i too hope that the government will reconsider clause <e> <s> i do not like it for three reasons <e> <s> it is retrospective but enough has been said about that already <e> <s> it seems to be discriminatory too in that you are taking the total number of tenants of charitable housing associations and giving the right to buy to a fairly small proportion of them <e> <s> you are not giving the right to buy to tenants of private landlords who may be in similar houses and who also may have received substantial government grants <e> <s> you are not giving the right to buy to tenants of pre- houses or to disabled tenants <e> <s>

statement on second reading about the offer by the minister for the disabled to act as a channel in this regard <e> <s> he stated that at that date only enquiries had been received <e>", "<cs> will the minister be kind enough to consider a little further the point that i raised <e> <s> he mentioned that there have been one or two more inquiries which i think would bring the total up to or <e> <s> on that evidence surely the explanation for the fact that the minister has only received inquiries is either that disabled people are not suffering disadvantage or discrimination or that disabled people do not feel that this is a satisfactory way in which to raise their difficulties <e>", "<cs> may i just inform the noble lord lord campbell that there is now a splendid lift at st pauls <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> like the noble baroness i think that the vast majority of cases of discrimination are not deliberate <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> it seems to me to be admirably clear and simple <e> <s> may i also express my preference for the phrase handicapped people rather than disabled people <e>", "<cs> my lords is the
