["<cs> my lords i am very conscious of the fact that as i rise to speak in your house for the first time we are approaching the end of one of the periodic seasons of maiden speeches and i feel sustained only by your lordships long and renowned record of tolerance on these occasions and can only hope that this tolerance will endure for the next few minutes <e> <s> in one respect at least i am fortunate <e> <s> the business of the house has brought forward this bill which gives me the opportunity so soon after my introduction to speak on a subject in which i have some interest and which of course is of very great interest to scotland <e> <s> as the noble lord said tourism is a growing and important industry for most parts of the world and perhaps more than most it is an important industry for scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that while it is good that there is a per cent <e> <s> increase in those customs and excise officers who are specifically dealing with drugs the officers themselves are very concerned about the general drop in the numbers <e> <s> because they are scattered throughout the ports and other entries to this country there can be loopholes for drugs to come in out with the places where there are anti-drug officers <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i thank the noble lord for repeating the statement <e> <s> despite what is said towards the end of the statement i am sure that the noble lord is fully conscious that this is extremely bad news for scotland <e> <s> so far as i have been able to examine the figures which the noble lord read out it seems that the government have dealt a double blow at scottish local authorities and scottish ratepayers <e> <s> not only has the level of rate support again been reduced but the figure for relevant expenditure has also been cut in real terms <e>", "<cs> having listened to my noble friend lord ross of marnock and also to the reply from the noble lord the minister i hope that the minister will reconsider the matter before it comes up at report otherwise we will put the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble lord the minister of state will have felt the feeling of the house on this particular amendment and realises his own particular isolation <e> <s> perhaps between now and report stage he will reconsider the matter <e> <s> in order to give him a chance to do so i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this is an interesting amendment <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister could use it to give us some indication of a number of points including the nature of the consultation that is likely to take place <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside has raised the question of the time taken to carry out these consultations <e> <s> it would be interesting if the noble lord the minister of state has any information as to how long a consultation on specific promotions will take <e> <s> i agree that long-term plans will be laid periodically <e> <s> for instance can he tell us how many people in st andrews house or wherever else in edinburgh they <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord tell us whether in consequence of this bill the number of civil servants devoted to scottish tourism will rise and whether perhaps they will get to a round figure from now on <e>", "<cs> <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has suggested that during the second reading of the bill nobody opposed clause <e> <s> that is quite true <e> <s> we were happy in principle about the clause despite the small amount of money which was entailed <e> <s> the minister must realise that although the helpful amendments which have been moved by me and by other noble lords have been sympathetically dealt with we have got nothing out of the government <e> <s> i hope the noble lord has learned this evening that the bill is not totally satisfactory and that the committee has clearly expressed the view that the scottish tourist board is not being given quite the independence authority and opportunities that it should <e> <s> we can only hope that when the minister is in scotland during the recess he will absorb its atmosphere again and that he will come to the blinding realisation that we were correct <e> <s> when therefore we reach the report stage or when the bill returns here from another place i hope the minister will be willing to consider more seriously and sympathetically some of the points which have been made <e>", "<cs> i should like to raise a very small point <e> <s> i was under the impression that the noble and learned lord the lord advocate had the power to classify roads special roads side roads or local roads and that that power was already contained in legislation <e> <s> why is additional power required if that power already exists or is this an attempt to specify a number of certain types of operations which can be performed on roads such as cycle tracks <e> <s> therefore is he not in danger of omitting something which we tried to discuss earlier on the question of generalities <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord has listed so many items would he not be inclined to miss out some other things <e> <s> would it not be better merely to retain to himself and local authorities the power to classify roads <e>", "<cs> on clause i am disappointed that the noble lord did not feel that anything had been said on second reading that gave him an opportunity to put down amendments to the bill to give considerably more flexibility to this clause than seems to be in it <e> <s> we are left with the fact that the secretary of state will make orders with very little time for discussion either in this house or in another place and these orders will be very important to fishing in scottish waters <e> <s> we remain unconvinced that this is the best way to settle local differences between fishermen <e> <s> however local management has been firmly rejected by the government and we now have to rely on the sensitivity with which the secretary of state uses his powers under clause of the bill <e> <s> this is why i wanted to speak now on this clause <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to be nit-picking but i am concerned about the idea that any sheriff court can deal with an offence <e> <s> i understand the point that because waters do not necessarily exactly correspond to a sheriffdom there may be difficulties but when i first read this provision i felt it was taking matters too far <e> <s> one presumes that perhaps the falkirk sheriff court or the hamilton sheriff court could deal with an offence <e> <s> my concern therefore is that assuming everyone is innocent until proved guilty there could be a great deal of inconvenience if the port to which a boat is taken is a long way from its base port <e> <s> i can see considerable difficulties in that respect <e>", "<cs> in many ways when we discuss fishing i am strictly out of my depth but i feel that the basic point made by the noble lord lord grimond is particularly apposite in this year of <e> <s> the noble lord made the point that one has to read a fairly long way down the clause before finding that there should be reasonable grounds for believing that an offence has been committed <e>", "<cs> i can see the point made by the lord advocate <e> <s> the only point that arises <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am pleased with the explanation except that perhaps i could raise one point with the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e> <s> when he was speaking i was thinking in terms of airports and perhaps power stations and places like that <e> <s> would such a road under other legislation be classified as a public road or a private road <e> <s> the noble lord lord nugent will be aware that in the other place during the committee stage of my own seat belts bill one member took an entire committee stage discussing what were public and private roads <e> <s> these were exactly the points he made <e> <s> he did it delightfully but we lost the bill because of it <e> <s> he took two and a half hours to discuss whether a road was public or a private road <e> <s> if a road was helped financially by the secretary of state in these circumstances and an airport or a power station were two of the examples given would that be classified for the purposes of other legislation as a public or private road or would it again depend upon a lot of other quite consequential things <e>", "<cs> with that explanation i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for his explanation <e> <s> it is important to repeat the very important point that these roads have special traffic designations and that there are no public utilities on them <e> <s> furthermore why do we not call a spade a spade and just call them motorways <e> <s> although the noble and learned lord the lord advocate suggested that motorways are the best known examples i am wondering which special roads other than motorways have that designation <e> <s> ordinary members of the public speak in a particular way while legally we speak in another way <e> <s> it all contributes to the mystique of the legal process <e> <s> i am happy with the explanation which has been given by the lord advocate but i should be most grateful if he could explain why motorways cannot be called motorways <e>", "<cs> although i am greatly in sympathy with the noble lords who have spoken and who hope that the name could be changed to motorway which seems the intelligent thing to do i accept the argument of the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e> <s> i can quote the example of <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for that explanation and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the lord advocate for that explanation and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the lord advocate for his explanation knowing that he will do what he can to try to meet the points that i have raised <e> <s> they were raised with me by local authorities and by the building industry in scotland <e> <s> on the promise that he will look at the matter i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the lord advocate for that explanation <e> <s> i agree that the amendment would have been better had it been only to delete as regards his application <e> <s> by them is rather important <e> <s> i still feel that as regards his application is superfluous and almost lumber <e> <s> it is not a point that is worth taking any further <e> <s> with the hope that the lord advocate will feel able to do a little tidying up and to make a few concessions by the next stage of the bill i would beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i understand the drift of what the noble and learned lord has said <e> <s> i wonder whether there is another part of the bill i think possibly there is where they talk about cycle paths and cycle tracks where there is a space between the road and the cycle track and then presumably there would be another space between the cycle track and the footpath or would it be a footway <e> <s> and where would the difference be <e> <s> i cannot see that a great deal would be lost by including footpaths as well as footways <e> <s> i am not very sure whether in scottish nomenclature we normally say footway rather than footpath <e> <s> it is more normally pavement of course <e> <s> i should have thought that the juxtaposition was wrong here but we are splitting hairs <e>", "<cs> i take the noble and learned lords point and i will withdraw the amendment but i will certainly give it some thought before the next stage of the bill <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> after that explanation i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for that explanation <e> <s> i understand the points that he is making and accept most of them <e> <s> the bill is largely non-political but one of the few political points that the bill brings up is this <e> <s> if local authorities are now to be responsible even in the cities that the noble and learned lord mentioned aberdeen glasgow greenock and dundee for clearing snow from in front of commercial premises which has previously been done by owners or occupiers it will involve the authorities in considerable additional expense at particular times of the year <e> <s> but that is a political point which can be taken up at a later date <e> <s> in the meantime i am happy with the explanation given by the lord advocate and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> while i appreciate the answer given by the noble and learned lord i was disappointed when he said that it was the negative resolution procedure <e> <s> this procedure i believe allows for no amendment <e> <s> i reiterate the point made by the noble earl lord selkirk <e> <s> this has been used in the south but it is absolutely new to scotland and anything associated with roads and motor cars is something that raises a great deal of public interest as i am sure the noble and learned lord is only too well aware <e> <s> i hope that great delicacy and great wisdom which is not always the case with any government are used before this innovation is brought before the scottish people <e> <s> i hope for instance that there will be opportunity for your lordships to look at draft provisions before final regulations are brought in for a once-and-for-all yes or no in this chamber <e>", "<cs> i can see the point which the lord advocate is making <e> <s> it is an either/or situation <e> <s> if it is on a boundary it will go to the court of session but if there is a sheriff available it will go to him to determine <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may support the noble earl lord selkirk on this point <e> <s> i have had communication on a very similar point which i would imagine would be included in this particular clause by this amendment <e> <s> it appears that there is an omission apparently a gap in the scottish law which may be able to be corrected in this bill <e> <s> the story i have been sent is that a hedge-cutting machine threw thorns across a road and they burst the tyres of a vehicle the owner had very great difficulty in getting any recompense from the farmer or in persuading the police to take any action <e> <s> that is bad enough but of course there also could have been considerable personal injury there was none in this case i am glad to say but there could have been <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i return to a point which has been mentioned before and which i feel will come up on many other discussions on the question that the clause stand part <e> <s> this clause gives the roads authorities powers to control the siting and operating conditions of all types of builders skips which are unlike their present powers <e> <s> i understand section of the roads scotland act limits skips being used for purposes other than building to only the roads authority <e> <s> it seems a logical extension that all skips on the road be now the responsibility of the roads authority rather than the district authority <e>", "<cs> there is a small point to which my attention has been drawn <e> <s> this is perhaps the only time i can raise it because i was too late to put down an amendment <e> <s> on clause stand part the lord advocate will perhaps be kind enough to take note of what i say and to look at the matter <e> <s> the description of the clause is deposit of mud from vehicles on roads <e> <s> however line refers to mud dropped or deposited on carriageways <e> <s> that would seem to exclude the pavement or the footpath <e> <s> it has been drawn to my attention that perhaps it would solve the problem because it is just as dangerous and <e>", "<cs> i should like to raise a very small point <e> <s> it has been brought to my attention that the only things that have been omitted and which we see on the roads every day are lighting columns <e> <s> if we look at paragraphs <e>", "<cs> i must say that i do not think i have previously noticed the lord advocate being quite so unsure of himself in this bill <e> <s> i felt that he was not altogether happy himself with the explanation he gave and i wonder whether he would think that just because it has always been considered as correct necessary or proper that it should be done now might be the time to reconsider it <e> <s> i felt that he was unsure about it <e> <s> while he seems to be very familiar with it in other statutes it appeared tome that he was saying why the hang have we got this in in any case <e> <s> why do we not do it as the word suggests <e> <s> i am sure there is more comfort in adding something which has always been done but i would be most grateful if he takes this away to reconsider how important it really is to substitute this word and for or <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to comment on the fact that today we have a new member of this house in my noble friend lord mulley <e> <s> i have particular reason to notice his coming here because i was his junior for a period at the ministry of transport <e> <s> he would remember very well as i did about three weeks ago when the new part of the m was opened that we went out to look over epping forest to see how we could get that road through and cause as little disruption as possible to a very attractive part of the country <e> <s> it is perhaps an indication of how fast we move in transport that it must be all of or years since we looked at that piece of road and the road has just newly been opened <e> <s> i hope that the housing situation does not take quite so long before we see some improvement <e> <s> i certainly enjoyed the speech of my noble friend and i look forward to re-making his acquaintance in this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the minister realises that his reply has been rather disappointing and i only hope that there are second thoughts between now and the bill going to another place <e> <s> however i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the minister has gone a fair way towards showing that the secretary of state has powers which is the point that we were trying to elicit from him by means of the amendment <e> <s> i take note of his undertaking to look again at the wording <e> <s> we have raised this question with the minister because of the representations that we have received <e> <s> in the light of the ministers good faith in coming a little way towards meeting us and bearing in mind his explanation i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i could press that point knowing how important it is that the delivery of new ships should hit the correct part of the season <e> <s> i had the unpleasant experience in another capacity of having to defend a ship going to another yard because delivery at the correct part of the season could not be guaranteed <e> <s> would the minister make it clear to the scottish office that forward planning and even forward ordering should be resorted to particularly since there is spare capacity in scottish and british shipyards bearing in mind always that for these purposes a ship must be delivered at the end of march or at the beginning of april <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl in his last answer but one suggested that there would be convergence of the teacher-pupil ratio in scotland and england <e> <s> would he confirm that this will be an improvement in england rather than a deterioration in the scottish ratio <e>", "<cs> my lords can we be assured that the report which we await with great interest will be published before the events in the second week of october in brighton this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i was asking whether we could have an assurance that the report will be ready before the conference in brighton in october <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware that this is a very special report <e> <s> with all due respect to his noble friend who spoke as a distinguished former chairman of the public accounts committee it is a very special report because this matter is causing great distress and suspicion if i may put it that strongly in scotland <e> <s> a date for the governments reply to the treasury minute ought to be fixed fairly soon <e> <s> also it must be a time when the house will have an ample opportunity to consider and debate it in depth <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill is really a very small thing in relation to scotlands housing needs in fact in scotland the government have such a poor record in housing that one could be forgiven for harbouring the thought that the highly controversial subject of council house sales was being specially introduced to divert attention from their failure in the whole field of house building <e> <s> the government keep stressing the importance they give to house ownership <e> <s> i believe it is one of the great myths that this government and the party opposite have been perpetrating on the people of scotland for a long time <e> <s> the figures are that in under a labour government in the private sector in scotland houses were built <e> <s> in there were and in with the present government in power the figure had fallen to <e> <s> that was after the promises made by the party opposite during the election <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord can give me some idea of how the sales in the rural areas compare with those in the urban areas <e> <s> i understand that for perhaps obvious reasons the sales are very much higher in the rural areas maybe even double <e> <s> can the noble lord confirm whether that is the case <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down it is rather important to know whether the noble lord will endeavour to give us the regulations so far as they have been evolved before the bill goes into committee so that we shall have something to work on and perhaps improve <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for the explanation that the noble lord has given of the effects of the amendments set down in my name <e> <s> when i look at the amendments particularly amendment no <e> <s> i realise that he may well be in fact i am sure he is absolutely correct that i have possibly taken the wrong subsection <e> <s> perhaps your lordships will bear with me if i try to explain what i was trying to achieve <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord <e> <s> lord campbell of alloway could perhaps explain slightly more fully the effect of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i think it may be one of the <e>", "<cs> this has been an interesting debate in that we have realised there is really no justification whatsoever for increasing the discount from to per cent <e> <s> while i can appreciate the point made by the noble earl lord selkirk that he is not really concerned and he could not find any emotional involvement in it i think the point which it is important to appreciate and i am sure he knows this at least as well as i do is that one of the major problems in scotland has been the type of industry we have had the whole clyde estuary and the dundee area have always been areas of hunger and poverty as well as the mobility of labour required <e> <s> because of that as my noble friend lord ross of marnock said very few people had jobs of long or steady tenure <e> <s> that is one of the reasons why there was never the same house ownership in scotland as there was in other parts of the country <e>", "<cs> since the noble lord the minister dealt rather widely with clause perhaps he will go on to answer the question that i put to him <e> <s> i asked exactly how one makes sure if one is an atomic energy authority tenant in a place such as dounreay that one will get a local authority house and ensure that ones time in the aea house will count towards the purchase <e> <s> there could be an understandable reluctance on the part of a local authority to provide houses particularly the more saleable types of houses to people who are in tied houses knowing that after two years they would lose them permanently from the stock <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister will not be surprised to realise that his answers have not been totally successful in allaying the fears of the committee <e> <s> he quoted quite correctly subsections and of section of the act and he also pointed out that local authorities have not urged the secretary of state to use his power <e> <s> the noble lord lord mackie made one very important point when he said that it is rather early days to discover whether local authorities will not at some point require to use those powers <e> <s> the period between and today is not all that long for someone contemplating purchasing a house and it is also right in the middle of a recession when perhaps there are fewer demands by people to buy second homes than there were previously or will be in the future <e>", "<cs> the noble lords reply is disappointing <e> <s> he began by saying that there is <e>", "<cs> the minister has to some extent satisfied me although he has left a great number of questions unanswered <e> <s> in fact he almost himself raised questions which he has left unanswered for instance what happens when it is a major structural repair <e> <s> we know that that point was partly covered by the fact that the liability would be somewhere between and <e> <s> i assume that there will be some way of keeping pace with inflation and changing times <e> <s> buildings last a long time <e> <s> in or years could look very silly <e> <s> i am not even sure whether a great deal would be done now by many-builders for <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble and learned lord the lord advocate could expand on what is meant by general planning authority <e> <s> the phrase district planning authority is understandable <e> <s> do i take it that when he talks about general planning authority he means for instance the highlands board or some area such as the gear project in the east or west end of glasgow <e> <s> i wonder whether he will kindly intervene to clear this matter up <e>", "<cs> my lords that clears up the point so far as tonight is concerned <e> <s> when one thinks of it is the noble and learned lord the lord advocate not introducing a new title or definition of the western isles the orkney isles district council or the highland and islands council by calling them general planning authorities <e> <s> i think it would be rather confusing as it obviously was to your lordships here tonight when the noble lord spoke suddenly about general and district planning authorities <e> <s> tonight it is understandable but i wonder whether in the future there will need to be some clarification in the bill in order to spell out that a general planning authority would be the authority which had both regional and district functions as the highlands and islands authorities have <e> <s> i find it slightly confusing <e> <s> i believe from looking at other noble lords in the chamber that they have a feeling of puzzlement as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say how grateful we are to the lord advocate for adding this <e> <s> when we are trying to expand industry and at the same time have additional roads where necessary it is important that industry should be included <e> <s> i understand the special needs of agriculture when a new road can totally cut a field or a farm in two <e> <s> it is important that industry should be considered in planning as well <e> <s> we are grateful to the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i was grateful to get the opinion of the noble and learned lord the lord advocate as to why the words raise or lower or otherwise should be retained but i feel that it would help to reduce the wordage <e> <s> i understand the question of a camber in the road the road may be raised at one point and lowered at another <e> <s> but i still cannot understand and i may be rather dull why a roads authority may alter as they think fit the level of a public road cannot apply to that <e> <s> they could raise the outside of the bend by one foot and lower the inside by six inches and that would still be altering as they think fit <e> <s> i do not want to be pedantic about it but i feel that it is something which would make it easier when it goes to the other place at a later stage if the noble and learned lord the lord advocate could give it some thought <e> <s> i hope he will think about it again <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the lord advocate for having looked at this point <e> <s> it was actually the automobile association through i think their legal department who had some problems with this very subject with <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the lord advocate for having taken the trouble to find a form of words that expresses fairly well what i was trying to explain to the committee <e> <s> i thank him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e> <s> as regards changing carriageway to road i should like to ask the noble and learned lord a question relating to an earlier matter as regards which we should perhaps have put down an amendment <e> <s> i understand that it has to be road because carriageway is merely the road upon which a carriage or vehicle will drive <e> <s> therefore the road presumably extends from the heel of the pavement to the heel of the pavement if we still have pavements i am not sure whether we do have them in scotland <e> <s> is that why the roads authority is now totally responsible for the removal of for instance snow and therefore there would need to be a much more complicated definition than road if the roads authority were not responsible for removing for example snow from the frontages of commercial and domestic premises <e> <s> is that one of the reasons behind the fact that we have been trapped into a situation where the roads authority on the day of a snowfall will need to get out and clear all the snow from the pavements and what we still call the road <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the lord advocate and to all those who took part for clarifying to the public the problems arising in this clause <e> <s> having heard the explanation i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i can see the purpose of the explanation of the noble and learned lord the lord advocate but as a layman and perhaps this is why one should always get legal advice i can see myself looking at a footpath and taking the major definition that is within the interpretation clause and not going further on whereas if the explanations given under subsection were referred more immediately to certain sections within the interpretation clause then to someone like myself a layman the interpretation clause would be more understandable <e> <s> there is a genuine confusion for someone like me in finding that something was not picked up earlier which appears to have been added at the end <e> <s> i agree that it removes any danger of doubt but as my noble friend lord ross of marnock said we are not disagreeing with the substance but merely with the placing within the bill of these particular clauses <e>", "<cs> my lords we went through all this in committee <e> <s> the minister has spoken about freedom of choice <e> <s> i must come back to the point that for many thousands of people in scotland freedom of choice does not exist because the government have starved local authorities of capital for building local authority housing <e> <s> by this measure the government are encouraging people to take houses out of the housing stock of local authorities <e> <s> therefore they are making the possibility of the homeless obtaining housing even more difficult than it is at present <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister has given a long explanation <e> <s> he did not however cover the very important point that was made by my noble friend namely the question of whether local authorities would be likely to look favourably upon someone coming from one of the occupations detailed in clause paragraphs <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill has been debated at great length in another place <e> <s> it has also been debated very widely in scotland by the individual local authorities by cosla by professional bodies particularly the assessors the chambers of commerce and the scottish cbi <e> <s> in many respects the principles behind the bill were very fully debated on monday when your lordships house dealt with the english rates bill <e> <s> i think it should be pointed out to welsh and english members that this bill takes even more power than was taken in the bill which raised the historic vote in this house on monday <e>", "<cs> my lords so far we have had a long debate and a long series of very important statements <e> <s> therefore <e> <s> i shall endeavour not to delay the house too long <e> <s> i am also sure that this bill will be greatly discussed in committee <e> <s> it affects many of us <e> <s> for from wherever we may originate or wherever we happen to go at the weekends nevertheless we use london transport throughout the week <e> <s> therefore practically all of us are thorough experts in the whole question of london transport <e>", "<cs> i am sure that we are all rather disappointed at the answer of the minister <e> <s> i think he should realise that within the amendment there is no demand for immediate action <e> <s> there is just a feeling that the present rating system and we have heard this from all sides of the committee is very very perplexing to a great number of people in scotland including we ourselves who are supposed to be the ones who should understand it <e> <s> we find great difficulty in understanding it <e> <s> many examples have been given of the difficulties <e> <s> something is happening when whether it is because of the fact that the rates are based on the rental system or not we are finding as the noble lord lord grimond has said cities like glasgow becoming mainly insurance branch offices when very good shopping streets are disappearing and are becoming either building societies or banks or television showrooms and when all the little shops are disappearing <e> <s> we do not know what the answer is and i am sure that the noble lord the minister also is not aware of the answer <e> <s> certainly the committee is not aware of what should happen <e>", "<cs> the minister must appreciate that the points put by several noble lords from this side of the committee have not been fully answered <e> <s> i accept that he is not a lawyer but i am sure that he has sufficient understanding to realise that in his opinion quite distinctly would appear to take the matter out of the hands of the courts <e> <s> i am not inclined to ask for a division on this amendment but i do not think it would be right to let the matter pass without at least asking the minister to take the amendment away and consider whether the phrase will put the secretary of state above the courts by giving him this incredible power <e> <s> there are other words which would give him flexibility such as the old legal stalwart reasonable reasonable authority or reasonable powers instead of merely in his opinion <e> <s> local authorities which represent large numbers of people might feel badly done by but because of those words they would have no way to challenge the secretary of states decision once it had been made <e>", "<cs> the noble lord suggested that by putting in reasonable and consistent we had in some ways made things more rigid <e> <s> in fact when i was speaking earlier about the secretary of state in his opinion i suggested that words like reasonable were the old lawyers way of giving flexibility <e> <s> but the words in his opinion take away flexibility completely <e> <s> i am surprised that in so quick a juxtaposition the noble lord should use the very words that i used <e> <s> he seemed to have the impression that the words in the opinion of the secretary of state gave more flexibility <e> <s> we have been saying for some time that this was not the case <e>", "<cs> i was intrigued when the minister suggested that all the orders could be taken separately <e> <s> i thought that the whole purpose of the clause in the bill was as he said to streamline the procedure <e> <s> there was no suggestion that parliament would have an opportunity to deal with them separately <e>", "<cs> according to my bill section of the act and section b are concerned with the power of the secretary of state to control rates <e> <s> perhaps the minister who has the power behind his elbow <e>", "<cs> yes i can accept that fully and agree with the minister but he mentioned a code of practice <e> <s> it would be for the interest of the committee if before the bill ultimately left the house we could have some view of the code of <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his reply <e> <s> i understood him to say that it leaves the authority which has a higher percentage than a neighbouring authority with per cent <e> <s> to be met because of its circumstances <e> <s> i firmly believe that this should be a national rather than a local responsibility <e> <s> however it is a point to which we could return later <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mackie of benshie suggested there are one or two other areas which we may be encouraging the minister to look at as well as this matter which comes under the rating disabled persons act <e> <s> i shall not press the amendment on this occasion but will take the opportunity to say that at a later stage we shall want more information from the minister <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the minister for agreeing to look again at the matter <e> <s> he mentioned that great concern has been expressed on all sides of the committee <e> <s> it should be emphasised that nobody wishes to stifle the right of people to know what is happening <e> <s> the noble lord should also consider whether there will be confidentiality <e> <s> will it be possible for instance to inspect bills of quantities which local authorities accept from builders for say civil defence shelters <e> <s> there may be long queues of people waiting to take copies of bills of quantities of that kind <e> <s> that might be a new phenomenon but it <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will be able to improve the wording <e> <s> we shall have another opportunity to look at the matter <e> <s> having received those assurances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> that explanation clears up a lot of the worries that we on this side had <e> <s> the lord advocate is obviously concerned that this power is never used and has said that it has never been used before <e> <s> furthermore and more important it needs affirmative resolution <e> <s> with that explanation i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very happy with that explanation and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have one or two questions to ask the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e> <s> first we are grateful to him for leaving out the words and unfurnished in his manuscript <e>", "<cs> i do not want to labour the point but when i mentioned election rooms i also referred briefly to short lets of non-charitable places <e> <s> would they also be covered by the discretion given to the local authority or would there be an overweening power by the assessor to say no this is an assessors job and not for the local authority <e> <s> it seems to me that there are two choices available <e> <s> the local authority which has no ultimate control over the assessor would appear to be able to say to the assessor that he does or does not look at something <e> <s> i may be getting mixed up here but it seems to me to be a point that needs clarification <e>", "<cs> the minister must appreciate from the broad interest in the purpose of these two amendments how important members of the committee feel it is that consideration should at least be given to the idea of consultation <e> <s> turning to the composition of the corporation there are a number of misconceptions <e> <s> as my noble friend lord underhill said there is no requirement that the members of the corporation should be elected <e> <s> they ought to be nominated by the greater london council or by the local authorities of greater london in order to give the minister a wider choice <e> <s> the ministers list of treasury appointees is a little tattered in terms of choice <e> <s> the word dictatorial has been used <e> <s> i would never suggest that this is a proper way in which to describe the noble lord the minister <e> <s> however secretaries of state change <e> <s> during the past few years secretaries of state for transport have changed very frequently <e> <s> governments also change <e> <s> therefore it is possible that a new secretary of state in a new government would find that he was dealing only with people who had been selected by the previous secretary of state after consultation with the chairman not with those who had greater understanding of the difficulties experienced by those who use the service <e>", "<cs> at this stage of the bill the philosophy on both sides of the committee relating to the financial targets is so different that we shall not gain a great deal from the minister <e> <s> i believe that the amendment would have tightened up the bill and would have made it slightly more important that the secretary of state should carry out his obligations <e> <s> since however it is unlikely that there will be much movement because the philosophy on both sides is so different and because the minister believes that the problem is largely dealt with in the bill i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i must agree with my noble friend that the minister made a long statement which i think we shall all read with great interest <e> <s> it is extremely complicated and it is something that will be brought up later <e> <s> the issue put forward by my noble friend is still the same that the local authorities in this case are still paying very large sums and will be doing so in the future but will have absolutely no redress at all <e> <s> however as the minister is unlikely to give a great deal more than he has already given by way of explanation i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> although the minister gave a very full explanation i think he realises that he has far from satisfied this side of the committee <e> <s> again the explanation was extremely complicated and it may be interesting to hear the noble baroness lady gardner speaking on the question whether the clause shall stand part of the bill to see with her experience of the glc how well she can interpret the ministers answer <e> <s> my noble friend lord mcintosh who was very much involved was not able to accept nor fully to comprehend the ministers answer <e> <s> in order to look at the ministers answer and to be able to put down a reasoned amendment at the next stage i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> the minister will not be surprised to hear that i am somewhat disappointed at his replies <e> <s> i suggested that amendment no <e> <s> was something that we should perhaps need to look at carefully and come up with some other arrangement <e> <s> while i believe that the present philosophy of the bill is asking a great deal nevertheless the local authorities are paying a great deal of money and will be paying a great deal of money under this bill and yet they appear to have little or no representation <e>", "<cs> i believe that the ministers reply merits a great deal more examination <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i listened with interest to the sympathetic consideration that the noble earl gave to the amendments <e> <s> however i was disappointed with his conclusions <e> <s> they are important points as he stressed <e> <s> it is perhaps a bit of a reflection on the whole system that such important points are discussed at such a late hour <e> <s> with the possibility of raising them at another stage in the proceedings on the bill i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> i listened to the minister and although i think that there are points to be raised i understand what was said in another place and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the purpose of the amendment that i moved was not to do many of the things suggested by the minister although he gave a very comprehensive reply <e> <s> the whole purpose of the amendment was to ensure that before the secretary of state made any decision about what should happen to any excess he should not only consult london regional transport but also the boroughs which would be paying the bulk of the figure <e> <s> again we are back to the argument that we have been having all along from the beginning of this bill both here and in another place <e> <s> all the changes in the revenue from london transport are being decided solely by the secretary of state without any consultation with the people who are represented or those who use london transport whatever their political complexion <e> <s> however <e> <s> i do not believe that at this late point in the discussion the noble lord the minister is likely to accept the amendment <e> <s> i therefore beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for that explanation <e> <s> it is an explanation that i want to consider with great care but i am grateful for the care that the minister has taken in giving it <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for the eminently sensible intervention of the noble lord on the cross-benches <e> <s> i am disappointed by the ministers reply <e> <s> i thought that this was a modest request <e> <s> we know that there will in any case be consultation <e> <s> however as the amendments suggest there will be to-ing and fro-ing behind the scenes between the officials of the local authority and the officials of the nationalised industries <e> <s> there will be a great deal of discussion and it would be sensible to require that there should be consultation with no strings attached <e> <s> london regional transport would listen to the representations made to them and would either throw them out or include them <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord tordoff <e> <s> he is absolutely correct <e> <s> the credibility of the passengers committee would be very greatly enhanced if they had the right to be informed before a change is made and if they also had the right to be informed about the immediate plans of london regional transport <e> <s> the people who will sit on this committee will be conscientious <e> <s> if they are merely given information after decisions have been taken i doubt very much whether they will wish to continue to sit on the committee <e> <s> the result will be that the people who ought to serve on this committee will not be prepared to do so <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment though i shall probably move it again in a slightly different form at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the minister for his consideration and i look forward to having his observations when we reach report stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> yes i am most grateful to the minister <e> <s> i will look at it carefully but i think he has answered all the points i made <e> <s> i will certainly be a wiser and better-informed man once i have read his words <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that explanation and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for putting that on record <e> <s> he talks about comparing london with other authorities outside london in regard to the tucc but in most of the discussions on this bill we have been told just how different london is from the rest of the country <e> <s> apparently when it is apt it is possible to ask the tucc <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord tordoff for having moved amendment no <e> <s> and i believe that it would be for the convenience of your lordships committee if as the noble lord suggested we took with it amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> both of my noble friends have made important points <e> <s> the minister has said that so far as he understands it they will be continued <e> <s> however it would be useful if the minister would look at the matter more closely <e> <s> the gap between the takeover day and the final working out of the schemes is an important point and it may involve quite a long time <e> <s> if the minister would agree to look at the matter and give us a specific statement at the next stage of the proceedings then i would beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister has given a long and helpful explanation <e> <s> i should have preferred him to give a different example than the fairly obvious one of lrt embarking on a large-scale assessment or a large scientific or technical assessment which involves them in equipment <e> <s> for instance i was concerned about the disposal of land and whether the secretary of state could give the instructions to dispose of land even at a loss <e> <s> that is when we come on to slightly more difficult ground <e> <s> however perhaps the noble lord the minister would take note of everything that has been said in committee as i am sure he does and at the next stage of the bill deal with this matter specifically <e> <s> that requires a little more explanation than we have been given <e> <s> i see that he has signified his agreement to do that and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl used two unfortunate examples when replying <e> <s> he spoke first about rent as a percentage of main manual workers in full-time employment in scotland <e> <s> this is almost a sick joke when one realises that the number of unemployed in scotland is more than and rising <e> <s> the number of main manual workers in full employment as a percentage of the population is going down and down <e>", "<cs> yes of course my lords <e> <s> it was the proud boast of my government that the rate for manual workers was slowly increasing <e> <s> this has happened now because of the relatively large number of people involved in the oil industry compared with five years ago not because the oil industry has necessarily grown but because the rest of the working male population has declined <e> <s> therefore the weighting towards the highly-paid oil industry has considerably pushed up the average wage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very sorry to interrupt <e> <s> but a letter to me from the scottish council for single homeless suggests that although the communal accommodation order came into operation months ago up until st may it was not aware of any premises that had yet been revalued <e> <s> i should be pleased if the minister could say that since that time the department and the assessors have been getting together <e> <s> i think it is important to reinforce the fact that it has taken at least months before there has been any movement or apparent movement in that field <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> as the minister knows the purpose of the amendment was really to draw the attention of the government and particularly if i may say so with respect the assessors to the anomalies which seemed to have been continued <e> <s> i am most grateful for the ministers reply and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too accept this particular amendment <e> <s> in the short term it will probably have little effect on rating but as a principle it shows what many of us have been saying all through the passage of this bill both in another place and in this place that scottish rating and valuation needs a complete overhaul <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mackie of benshie said the government have given a very little on reed beds and a little on things such as the mooring of buoys <e> <s> altogether we are finding as we go through the bill with this government that what seems to be happening all the time is that we have <e>", "<cs> my lords i think also that something should be said before this bill is finally passed <e> <s> i must apologise that my noble friend lord ross who has done so much work on the bill is not able to be with us today but the house will perhaps be glad to know that he is recovering from his disability <e> <s> we have taken a great deal of time discussing this bill not only in this house but in another place and i am afraid we had very little flexibility from the government <e> <s> it seemed to me that the minister was under orders to concede absolutely nothing although it is a very very important bill for the people of scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that very full explanation <e> <s> there was just the possibility that by including the amendment as i moved it it would have given encouragement to employees of london transport <e> <s> however i am very glad that the minister has made the position so clear and that it is on record <e> <s> i am very pleased to be able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i can understand what the minister has said in explanation and i have great personal faith in his good intentions but i am not sure that as time goes on such intentions are always interpreted in quite the way that was intended when put forward by a minister at such a time as this <e> <s> it is perfectly possible for a job to be done satisfactorily and more cheaply by cowboys <e> <s> i am not saying they are incompetent but all the other things i have suggested such as health and safety and so on may not perhaps be carried out and therefore that would be unfair competition although the standard of work might he perfectly reasonable <e> <s> in fact it could very well be that because they do not pay all those expenses there is something in an envelope on a friday night for the workers as happened not very far away from this palace some years ago <e> <s> that became quite a notorious case <e> <s> therefore it is perfectly possible to get a good job and a cheap job and hence unfair competition because all the basic things are not done <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with interest and i am grateful for part of the statement by the minister particularly when he quite correctly pointed out the reference to clause of the bill <e> <s> however i do feel that he has perhaps missed a great opportunity to gain some experience <e> <s> obviously he is not going to grasp the opportunity so i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord the minister for putting down this amendment <e> <s> i must apologise to him for my slight inattention <e> <s> even lowland people like myself are occasionally momentarily swept into the current of the normal channels of communication in this place <e> <s> there was a slight distraction <e> <s> i will however read with great care the very full explanation the minister gave <e> <s> in the meantime i thank him very much for having given attention to the amendment which i moved on an earlier occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble lord lord lucas will realise that although this scheme has been welcomed by everyone on all sides of the house including myself there are nevertheless a number of very important points that have been raised for which i am sure he will also be grateful and which he will take away <e> <s> i think that practically everyone was trying to be helpful with those points <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer that the minister has given today is perhaps warmer than the answer which he gave last time in that he suggested that the london passenger transport committee would no doubt read the proceedings in <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble earl for his introductory remarks on the commons amendments to this bill <e> <s> we on this side of the house are also very pleased that many of the amendments are the result of our discussions and suggestions and even of amendments put down in this house by myself my noble friend lord ross of marnock and the noble lord lord grimond <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl will not be surprised if i say that his reply is disappointing <e> <s> we are not concerned with trying to stop competion we are concerned with stopping unfair competition <e> <s> after all i said in earlier discussions on the subject i had hoped that he would realise that it is perfectly possible to have a cheaper but satisfactory job done and he may not like the phrase general conditions of service one which is nevertheless carried out by people who are bad employers <e> <s> i would think that there are legal precedents for the use of the definition good employer <e> <s> i need to check on that but i am sure that the minister is aware that there is a classification of what are considered legally to be good employers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for the obvious trouble that the noble viscount has taken to explain the lack of necessity for the new clause <e> <s> i think that he will realise that it is not totally satisfactory because i still have the difficulty in reading the wildlife and countryside act that one of the duties imposed on the counties and the london borough councils as surveying authorities is to treat only and to name only footpaths bridleways and byways which are open to all traffic <e> <s> while i am grateful for the great care that the noble lord has taken in replying we on this side and i am sure the whole house including the noble lord who inspired the bill do not want to lose any of the rights that already exist <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like very briefly to agree with the general theme of the amendments of the noble lord lord beaumont although i see that there could be difficulties in trying to make everything work from day <e> <s> but he raised a very important point when he spoke of the difficulties which the blind could have <e> <s> perhaps the minister has had correspondence as i and the noble lord have with the royal national institute for the blind who are very concerned and who ask for a total separation of footpaths and cycle tracks <e> <s> i hope that the minister has looked at this point and has made some computation of the cost <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> is he aware that there is a feeling of great uncertainty and concern among employees of british rail as to their future <e> <s> there is obviously concern about their own jobs <e> <s> they are concerned that if sealink is sold there should be a guarantee that it will be sold as a single package and that after it has been sold even as a single package it will not be broken up <e> <s> can the minister assure the house that the existing services will be more or less protected <e> <s> finally can he give any indication as to how the container traffic is improving because that was one of the sticking points particularly in respect of the holyhead dn laoghaire service <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord lord gray for his elucidation and also for his previous notice in writing giving me a full explanation as to why this amendment is necessary <e> <s> i should like to express the hope that in this latter stage of the bill the government have taken note of the very wide debate that has been held in the house and the need for perhaps an even more fundamental look when the next opportunity arises at some of the questions relating to scottish rating <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that everyone will agree that this has been a most worthwhile debate <e> <s> as everyone has said we should all be grateful to the noble lord lord peyton for introducing the debate and most of all for the extremely open way in which he put the very important questions and even after this debate we shall all be wondering where the answers lie <e> <s> in his speech and in subsequent statements the secretary of state has made it clear that a great deal of information is required before he and the government can finally decide on a policy with which we shall have to live for a very long time and which will be extremely expensive <e> <s> whatever decision is made it will be one of mammoth expense and is not one that can suddenly be changed <e> <s> therefore very grave decisions will be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords may i briefly thank the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for his reception of the bill <e> <s> he said that the law commission had taken great care when they formulated their report and published the draft bill <e> <s> i think that the house should be grateful to him in his maiden speech for having taken such care and courtesy in replying to the bill and clarifying one or two of the points which certainly i as a non-lawyer am finding out more about every time i read the bill and every time i listen to my own noble and learned friends in the house here <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the house is grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for explaining the necessity for these amendments <e> <s> it is also perhaps grateful for the fact that the timing was such that it was possible to include the amendments in the consolidation measure which will make the legislation more understandable at least in these two minor respects and there will not need to be quite as much digging hack in the records <e> <s> i am quite happy to support the lord advocate on both amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that in allowing the solo flats to go ahead the secretary of state did waive building regulations and in fact reduced the requirements and made the regulations for private building a good deal less onerous than those for public building <e> <s> is he aware that there is great anxiety in scotland about any thought of diminution of housing space <e> <s> does he appreciate that only desperation for a roof over their heads plus a very hard sell by certain companies reputed to be in the nature of per house on advertising is forcing people in particular young couples to take these houses which they are then finding very great difficulty in selling if they need to move to another place <e> <s> finally has the minister visited any of these houses being built <e> <s> i can assure him that even in their showroom condition that is with everything looking right and properly and scientifically laid out the space is quite abominable <e> <s> it will be a tragedy if there is any reduction at all in space in scottish housing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to come back to the noble earl the minister but that is precisely the reason for the anxiety in scotland <e> <s> we were cursed for very many generations with quite inadequate space in our houses <e> <s> is the noble earl aware that there is great terror that if we continue as we are and space regulations are reduced further we could get back to the terrible problems of the single-flat house that was the curse of scotland for so many years <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also add my congratulations to the noble lord on his having reached the front bench <e> <s> is he aware that british rails planning has been extremely good <e> <s> when it switched to electrification on the west coast line there was very little disruption <e> <s> that makes me wonder whether he can tell me about progress on planning of the glasgow to ayr electrification <e> <s> he may not have the answer immediately but i hope that he will make inquiries and perhaps let the house know what progress has been made in the planning stage of that electrification <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble and learned lord the lord advocate could perhaps help me in my interpretation of this amendment <e> <s> could he tell me what safeguards the local authority or the road authority would have if there was a very long delay between the starting of a scheme for example an estate of houses and the building of a road <e> <s> a point could be reached in which because of a long delay there could have been a considerable escalation of cost over what was generally agreed as being a reasonable bond for the local authority to complete the road <e> <s> however as i understand it if the contractor is not able to complete the road the roads authority must do the work <e> <s> therefore it could take a long time to complete the housing estate since obviously the roads are only partly completed while the construction traffic is using them <e> <s> on the other hand severe difficulties could be encountered when the road was being constructed <e> <s> it would perhaps be beneficial to an unworthy contractor who decided that he would not complete the job and wished the local authority to complete it <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for his explanation of these particular amendments <e> <s> the house will also be hopeful that the amendments will do the job which he expects them to do <e> <s> i do not think there is any doubt that the link between lighting and speed restrictions in many cases is now outdated <e> <s> the noble and learned lord will be as aware as i am that in scotland the m the a and the a are fairly long stretches of road which have been released from restrictions and to these roads the standard national speed limits apply <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord banks for having raised the subject and put down the question today <e> <s> it is important to realise how great an expert he is on the subject of clyde steamers <e> <s> i was also grateful to the noble lord lord ferrier and interested in his remarks on the nostalgia of the clyde which is a very important part of the west of scotland culture <e> <s> i hope to make a brief reference to what the noble baroness lady elliot said in her few remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the minister has been given the wrong information <e> <s> ardentinny has never had a pier <e> <s> people were taken by a small boat from the mainland to ardentinny <e> <s> the nearest pier was at blairmore <e>", "<cs> my lords i am at a disadvantage compared with many of your lordships who have spoken in that i am not so familiar with devon as many of you obviously are <e> <s> i have learned a great deal from listening to the debate and i have no doubt at all that everyone who has spoken has spoken with great sincerity from a personal point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for that assurance <e> <s> i think that i was misled because of the interesting interventions we had earlier on the history of the matter <e> <s> hovever having said that the fact that the provision is there is of benefit to us all <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord the minister for his courtesy in repeating the statement to the house <e> <s> i think the only thing we can really thank him for is his continued courtesy <e> <s> he is always very courteous <e> <s> the statement itself is very thin disappointingly vague and really raises more questions than it answers <e> <s> yesterday many members of your lordships house went to the other place to hear the statement by the secretary of state for education and science in which he said that his right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland had also decided this matter implying that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i briefly make one or two points to the minister which i think are very important <e> <s> the secretary of state for education and science was able to make very detailed statements about exactly where his savings would be <e> <s> the noble lord the minister in this house said that he had been courageous and he referred to his having the courage to eat humble pie <e> <s> i think that many people in scotland now believe that he has put a very awkward humble pie in the oven for the secretary of state for scotland to digest at some point because when the grants for scotland are reduced we will have it on the block grant <e> <s> does this mean that housing social work and education will all need to be considered in order to save the little bits to which the noble lord lord mackie of benshie referred instead of saying we have made a mistake <e> <s> let it go <e>", "<cs> my lords we must all be grateful to the noble earl lord bessborough for raising this question <e> <s> he has chosen a most appropriate time <e> <s> when something is happening on the whole question of a channel link it is well worth having a look at the problem <e> <s> the fact that the french and british governments are getting together again is a great encouragement to those of us who have always felt the need for a channel link <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend lord beswick has done us a great service today by choosing a subject such as this for a debate <e> <s> he particularly attracted me to his motion because he said that he wanted the government <e>", "<cs> my lords the first thing i must do is to congratulate the noble lord lord chapple who was unable to stay for the end of the debate on his maiden speech <e> <s> knowing his reputation as the house will i think i can say that he managed to be for him perhaps mildly provocative by scepticism about government inquiries <e> <s> he gave an example of an inquiry on which he had served when he had received a beautiful leather-bound book after spending many hours on that committee <e> <s> he was also sceptical about the governments decision-making process <e> <s> i was particularly pleased because he is a real londoner he was born in london he has spent his whole life in london and most of his experience has been in london <e> <s> yet he was conscious of the importance of developing regional airports which is something one does not always hear to quite the same extent from people who have moved into london from the regions <e> <s> this is one of those contradictions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the minister who opened the debate the noble lord lord gray will have listened with great interest to the various points which were made in the debate <e> <s> they were all meant to be helpful <e> <s> however the general tenor that came through most of them was that perhaps it would have been better if the bill had awaited the outcome of the report of the advisory board instead of being rushed forward <e> <s> this came out very clearly particularly in the point made by the noble earl lord lauderdale that consultation with many groups before the bill was printed had been quite inadequate <e> <s> of course it makes it a great deal more difficult for a government to do anything really radical to a bill once it has actually been printed <e> <s> one wonders why it was rushed <e> <s> was there a gap in scottish legislation where the government thought they could get something in or were the draftsmen working on this bill a bit more efficient than those working on another bill and therefore were able to put this bill quickly into a slot for scottish legislation <e>", "<cs> i should like to say how much i agree with the noble earl lord perth on this point <e> <s> it may seem strange to insert in a scottish bill a provision relating to the importance of scottish material being included in the national museum but there is sometimes a tendency for museum keepers to follow particular trends rather than a particular locality <e> <s> i believe that scotland has sufficient culture even in the scientific environmental industrial and military fields to ensure that plenty of purely scottish material is included <e> <s> this does not mean that the museum would be filled with scottish things only but there should be an emphasis on scottish material or at least a powerful mention of scottish material in any scottish museum <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the statement that the minister made and for the assurance he gave that nothing of which he is aware is likely to make the government force the board to charge for admissions <e> <s> of course as with the act as he will find he probably did find and as with many acts passed by governments promises are made to repeal but because of the struggle with the parliamentary timetable legislation is not repealed <e> <s> but there is another consideration <e> <s> i think the noble lord will agree that the climate has changed in a great many ways since the days of <e> <s> the noble baroness lady elliot made reference to the earlier attempts to impose charging <e> <s> i think the minister will remember that various senior ministers had their wrists severely slapped by the public at large for even daring to think of charging <e>", "<cs> i did not intend to suggest that but whatever figure was charged i think would obviously be impossibly high <e> <s> i am sorry if i have misled the committee on that point <e> <s> i certainly did not intend to <e>", "<cs> i have no intention of forcing a vote and i shall withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i wonder however whether the noble lord the minister can help <e> <s> can he give an example i am genuinely seeking information here of why the wider perspective in the public interest is served by the secretary of state deciding the opening hours as though there was a likelihood of the authorities wanting to open at ridiculous times <e> <s> i have the feeling that if i was reading the noble lords speech in <e>", "<cs> the question about which i was concerned related to opening hours <e>", "<cs> my lords until the repetition of the sad statement which we have just heard we were discussing the london regional transport amendment bill <e> <s> it has been said by a number of noble lords that the bill has been made necessary because of the wrong directions given by the secretary of state following the passage of the london regional transport act <e> <s> the act received royal assent on th june and on th june only three days later the secretary of state directed the glc to pay london transport million <e> <s> the glc took the secretary of state to court on this direction and mr justice mcneill gave a judgment in january of this year which incorporated what must surely be one of the most severe reprimands any secretary of state has ever received from the high court <e> <s> i will refrain from reading the actual words but they are extremely sharp and extremely to the point <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he can confirm or deny that the department of transport actually urged the glc in to start leasing buses <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord would write to me <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank the noble earl for repeating the statement made by his right honourable friend in another place <e> <s> is he aware that this statement is primarily necessary only because of the dreadful mess the scottish office <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for having written to me on the leasing of london buses which was a point raised by myself and a number of other noble lords in the debate on th march <e> <s> the letter he sent to me explains to some extent the concern of the government over leasing but it does not answer the point raised by the noble lord lord diamond who at column asked the noble lord lord brabazon of tara <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for paying attention to what was said in another place on report and in this place at committee stage <e> <s> the inclusion of the word architectural will certainly remove all ambiguity so far as this small group is concerned <e> <s> there is always the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords again may i thank the minister for accepting this amendment <e> <s> he has gone some way to meet the point raised at the committee stage <e> <s> it is important that there should be a firm obligation on the board to establish all the facts about admission charges particularly their effect on attendances <e> <s> when we come to discuss this again perhaps we may have more information i am talking about the whole question of museums and charges because of the willingness the minister has shown to include these amendments in the bill <e> <s> i should like to thank him for doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that explanation which was very clear <e> <s> he will appreciate that with an order such as this a great deal of research by a back-bencher or by someone without government resources is necessary in order for him to understand exactly what is meant by the order <e> <s> so i am sure that his explanation has been of considerable help to everyone in the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his careful explanation of the order and for the valuable information which he gave us when introducing it <e> <s> an order on a subject such as this is understandable to most members because we nearly all drive and move around london <e> <s> indeed we must perforce come to westminster and in the course of doing so we see the traffic conditions <e> <s> such an order gives us the opportunity to review the problems and to ask the minister some questions many of which he has already answered <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that everyone who has listened to the noble lord lord mottistone and who wishes to take part in the debate and all those who are interested in the field of road safety will fully appreciate the motives behind <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we should all be grateful to the noble lord lord somers for having introduced this subject today <e> <s> i think that every noble lord who has so far spoken has congratulated him on the topic he has chosen <e> <s> he said at the beginning that travel was a competitive business among road rail canals and coastal shipping <e> <s> that is the main problem that the railways have <e> <s> some noble lords will know better than i do but i do not believe that the british railway system has made an overall profit since <e> <s> it goes back as far as that <e> <s> i am talking about the entire system and not specific parts of the network <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for repeating this statement to the house and for providing an opportunity to question the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the minister particularly for clearing up the point about the hybrid bill <e> <s> that was the point i was making about cheriton <e> <s> i am sure that he will return frequently to the question of the new technologies <e> <s> i listened with hope rather than conviction to what my noble friend lord howie of troon said <e> <s> on the question of hybridity and the collapse of the previous bill i think that it is rather important that we should realise that it was not as the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe said a total unilateralist decision by the labour government <e> <s> in earlier debates the reason for the collapse of the previous bill was spelt out clearly <e> <s> i shall send the noble lord lord taylor references which show that a body with which he had a great deal of involvement at the time had a great deal to do with the fact that the bill did not get through <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he is aware that the short notice given for the cancellation of the venue for the scotland-england game has thrown scottish supporters into great confusion <e> <s> small travel agencies particularly have suffered <e> <s> for many years they have handled the arrangements for scottish supporters going to games abroad where they have behaved extremely well as other noble lords have said <e> <s> individuals have been severely punished financially and some small travel firms are likely to face bankruptcy as a result of the short notice for the change of venue <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for the care that he took in explaining the amendments <e> <s> i thank him also for having the courtesy to send me the details of the proceedings of the statutory instruments committee held in another place <e> <s> as the noble lord will be aware statutory instruments are frequently highly specialised <e> <s> the distinguished members of the committee representing all parties and parliament itself looked at the matter carefully <e> <s> after reading their comments and having spoken to one or two of those who served on the committee i feel that there is little i can say except that the amendments appear to make life at sea that much more safe for most people <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that one of the main uses of cellular radio will be for telephones in motor cars <e> <s> although everyone accepts and welcomes the guidance of the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first of all thank the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for reading the reply already given in another place <e> <s> i am sure that the whole house will share the ministers shock at yet another death at the glenochil complex <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may briefly clear up one point <e> <s> i suggested that there was a need for special selection and special in-depth training in respect of prison officers <e> <s> i should make it clear that this is the wish of the scottish prison officers association and does not necessarily reflect on the staff of any particular institution <e>", "<cs> my lords i think everyone will pay tribute to the noble lord lord nathan for initiating this debate this evening <e> <s> it is interesting that the debate is being handled by the ministry of transport although at least four ministries are involved in the issue <e> <s> i am sure that like me the noble lord will have looked at this report with great care and will realise that it is not the normal run we have in transport when we discuss congestion in towns accident rates or matters requiring less expert and less detailed knowledge <e>", "<cs> i hope i was not too inadequate when i was speaking but one of my principal points was that the teams should be maintained <e>", "<cs> i shall be very brief <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for his last remarks <e> <s> however i think that at this particular stage of the bill probably the feeling of the committee is too definite to accept his guidance at this point with no disrespect to him <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the ministers reply <e> <s> i am always slightly concerned about a ministers secretary of state saying i do that in any case and therefore there is no need to do that <e> <s> i was in another place long enough to hear of a number of cases in which ministers had not made a report in one case on a scottish university since although it was in statute that he should make the report and we had to have a rather amusing exemption for the secretary of state so that he did not need to go to the hulks <e> <s> but i accept that transport policy is something that is rather more in the public mind and the public limelight and therefore as the minister has given the assurance that the secretary of state does in any case produce adequate reports there are facilities for asking the secretary of state and reminding him of the necessity to give a report <e>", "<cs> before that rather welcome interruption i was just about to beg leave of the committee to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i listened with care to the ministers reply and i think that what my noble friend lord mcintosh said is perfectly true <e> <s> if the minister had been able to find an answer to the difficulty that we are now in because of what happened earlier today his reply might have been more <e>", "<cs> i do not think anyone was suggesting that we should give up <e> <s> there is a great deal of worry as the noble lords lord tordoff and lord diamond said about this particular clause <e> <s> we are certainly not suggesting that the entire bill is in jeopardy because of this <e> <s> this is in a particular clause <e> <s> to be told that certain amendments are no longer applicable puts everyone in a difficult position in regard to report or third reading if the government should decide to return the bill to how it was <e> <s> it is a difficult situation <e> <s> no one wants to adjourn <e> <s> we are really in a great difficulty <e>", "<cs> considering all that has happened i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this is the difficulty that we are in <e> <s> but after the explanation of the noble lord i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> is the purpose of the noble lord in not moving amendment no <e> <s> a because there is doubt about the logicality of the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for that answer <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his reply <e> <s> i think there is a slight difference since he is going to have such responsibility now in not providing the reports direct to parliament but i do see the point he has made and think perhaps when we get to the transport bill there will be an opportunity to probe further <e> <s> so with his reassurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for explaining one or two points that were perhaps confusing <e> <s> i would suggest however that the proposals in the bill could lead to as many as different authorities having a finger in a particular airport <e> <s> the examples given by the noble lord involved two or three authorities <e> <s> in respect of manchester he was talking about two very powerful authorities <e> <s> i shall however study the noble lords reply carefully <e> <s> i am grateful for what he has said and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the house will be pleased that the minister has made the statement and at the fact that million has been obtained from the treasury <e> <s> as the noble lord lord boothby said it is quite a feat to get million from the present chancellor <e> <s> on the other hand the chancellor did say that it would never happen again <e> <s> herein lies part of the problem for ratepayers of scotland particularly the small business people <e> <s> i was pleased that the minister said that small business people would possibly benefit more than most <e> <s> the problem arises because we do not know what will happen in <e> <s> therefore there is the difficulty of small business people for instance retiring or wanting to sell their business <e> <s> they do not know nor does whoever is likely to buy the business have the faintest idea whether the rates in the future will go back to what they were originally assessed at and whether that will put them out of business <e> <s> as the minister will realise from looking at the press for some of the small businesses in parts of fife it was just impossible <e> <s> had no relief been given the rates would have been so appalling that they would have had to give up <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank the minister for repeating in the form of a statement the answer to the private notice question <e> <s> i am sure that the house will realise that it is a serious statement for a number of old well established railway communities particularly that of swindon which has a long tradition of railway work as well as my own town of glasgow where the springburn works have been building and maintaining railway rolling stock for more than years and where railway work is an absolutely vital part of the community <e> <s> it was built with the railways and this is a sad day <e>", "<cs> my lords have any arrangements been made about the possibility of those who work in the workshops in swindon and glasgow being offered alternative employment throughout the railway industry as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords i think this is a bill that we are all anxious to have on the statute book and i am sure we are all grateful to the noble lord lord strathcarron for agreeing to aid his honourable friend in another place by introducing this bill into your lordships house and moving its second reading today <e> <s> from my knowledge of the noble lord lord strathcarron and from what he has said few people are better qualified to give an opinion on the desirability of the wearing of crash-helmets by motor-cyclists and pillion riders <e> <s> in fact the noble lord was quite specific about the importance of the riders themselves as well as their pillion passengers wearing a properly fitting helmet <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a bill on which we shall not wish to divide the house <e> <s> the bill is helpful in the first part at least as it gives us an opportunity to examine the position of our ports and the governments policy more the present secretary of states policy towards the ports <e> <s> perhaps we can ask for some guidance on the future policy of the government in an area which everyone agrees is of major concern to any trading nation but to a nation such as our own an island nation it is absolutely vital because of the importance of trade and ports combined <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first of all thank the minister for repeating the statement made in the other place and also for arranging that a copy of the white paper was sent to this side of the house <e> <s> unfortunately it has just newly arrived and obviously it will take some studying <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord is aware that it is a very important statement and that it will not have total and universal approval on all sides of the house far less throughout the country <e> <s> it has a far-reaching effect in <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate the noble lord lord brougham and vaux on introducing this bill and on the way in which he did it <e> <s> i would also congratulate him on having a bill of this nature as a first bill because it is a really practical and well-needed bill for the motorist and i would say also for the police <e> <s> i think the main purpose of the bill from the point of view of the average motorist is that it gives him just a little more time to produce these documents that is instead of five days seven days <e> <s> the point made by the noble earl lord attlee is also important that as a defence some explanation should be possible in circumstances which are perhaps uncommon but not unusual <e> <s> the noble earl gave an instance of someone who was about to leave the country and who could find himself with a blemish on his licence which was really unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but my list of grouped amendments does not appear to be the same <e> <s> from my list it would seem that there are two separate groups amendments nos <e> <s> and a and amendments nos <e> <s> b and c <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said i have been given the amendments in these two groupings and i have prepared accordingly <e>", "<cs> my lords i referred to the fact that they would be coming up as amendments which were necessary but they were not chosen in the selection to be grouped with amendments nos <e> <s> and a and i considered it quite out of order that i should go ahead and take them at the same time <e> <s> as i said i had planned to <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we must take the amendments in series <e> <s> if it is not the wish of the house that clause be left out i should obviously like it to be amended <e> <s> even if the amendments that i have brought forward were carried i cannot see why amendment no <e> <s> to leave out clause cannot still be moved <e> <s> we are in a belt and braces situation if we cannot have one we want the other <e> <s> the amendments that i am moving are perfectly reasonable i suggest <e> <s> if they are accepted my noble friend lady birk can make her own decision as to whether she wishes clause to be omitted as can the noble lords lord kilmarnock lord bancroft and lord seebohm <e> <s> no matter what amendments are made to clause that will not prejudice in any way their decision on whether they want clause to be left out <e> <s> if the government decide that they do not want to accept the amendment that clause is left out we should rather have it with my amendments than without <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that there is a great difficulty <e> <s> the choice that i make is that i would want amendment no <e> <s> a accepted <e> <s> as i tried to explain earlier whatever happens to the clause it is always possible in a subsequent amendment to omit the entire clause should that be the wish of my noble friends on this side of the house <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i have moved it <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may speak to the noble lord on the woolsack <e> <s> i have had advice on this highly technical point <e> <s> it appears that in order to have the substance of my two amendments debated it would be wise for me to beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> but to move amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it most difficult to believe that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter to whom i have listened over many years and for whose understanding of parliamentary and government procedure i have great respect really believes that what he has just said is true <e> <s> perhaps there is a misconception <e> <s> the whole point made by my noble friend lord ardwick with others was that the moment the road is changed by <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely sorry if i did but i hope the noble lord will also take my point that people prefer the right to express themselves against official decisions of what can be to all of us whatever our position in life a very powerful and anonymous bureaucracy when we come up against it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to reinforce the point i made much earlier in our discussions tonight <e> <s> the reserve powers given to the secretary of state for taking over control of traffic control systems are totally unnecessary as a consequence of the acceptance of clause <e> <s> i believe that the amendment is therefore totally superfluous <e> <s> it should not be accepted <e> <s> i believe that the only reason the minister is moving it is that there is an anticipation of a decision that may be taken in another place <e> <s> however i imagine that the minister may want to look at it again <e> <s> if not although i oppose the amendment i shall not divide the house <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first thank the noble lord lord brabazon of tara for his kind remarks about the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> we all wish to be associated with them <e> <s> he is greatly missed and i know that he will be following todays debate with great interest <e> <s> he has been reading all the material covering the fields in which he was involved while he was active in the house and i hope that he will be able to rejoin us very soon perhaps even for the committee stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that the point raised by the noble lord lord boothby should have been dealt with a long time ago <e> <s> it is becoming a matter of great urgency <e> <s> obviously we must have the tourist coaches in london and in other places but they have a tendency to concentrate in one place <e> <s> the situation needs drastic examination <e> <s> the glc must be doubtful of what powers it now has as i am and so we need a study by the department to look at the question of coaches and perhaps to establish proper coach parks south of the river or in some other place <e> <s> as much as we want tourists they cannot be driven right to the doorstep of where they want to go <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it amendments nos <e> <s> to za and amendment go together <e> <s> i myself was caught up earlier and mistimed it <e> <s> i understood that they were being moved by the noble earl lord cranbrook and they will have the effect of removing passenger from the phrase passenger transport authority <e> <s> the amendments which have been tabled in my name will have the effect of removing the word transport and inserting strategic transportation <e> <s> i think these amendments are consequential on the acceptance of amendments nos <e> <s> b and c <e> <s> i hope they will be accepted <e> <s> i apologise for not having heard the reply to the noble earl lord cranbrook but from his expression it looks as though he had the same interpretation of the amendments as i have <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord accepts the spirit of it i am sure that the government can produce other words to make it sound more euphonious <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will realise of course that these amendments cannot be opposed because as he said it is necessary that the responsibility transfers to a successor body <e> <s> the objection we have on this side of the house which we feel should be put on record is this late inclusion of the amendments at report stage in your lordships house which is a clear indication that there has been lack of government preparation for the transaction <e>", "<cs> my lords with permission let me say that i agree that the new authorities should have the power with the <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> not on the basis of the explanation but because i am aware of the hour and the fact that it is something which will be discussed more fully when the white paper comes out i do not intend at this point to press the amendment <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords it was an interesting reply <e> <s> the noble lord kept making the point that the secretary of state had to be fully satisfied <e> <s> he said that more than once <e> <s> he said that the proposals had to make transport sense though that was not his actual phrase <e> <s> he said that particular metropolitan districts could be drawn out and it would still make sense but i think that that is most unlikely <e> <s> if the secretary of state is reasonable and another minister may be in the position by that time when a district asks for permission and he considers whether it will make transport sense he surely cannot be fully <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for repeating the statement that was made in another place and for giving me an earlier sight of it <e> <s> is the minister aware that this is a new and very serious departure in the governments control over local authorities in scotland <e> <s> we are now dealing not with guidelines but really with punitive penalties on local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for the reply that he has made <e> <s> he must realise on looking at the figures that he has given me i have only now had time to examine them that there are many authorities in excess of guidelines for instance eastwood at per cent <e> <s> strathkelvin at per cent <e> <s> and perth and kinross at per cent <e> <s> over guidelines all of them good solid tory local authorities run by businessmen <e> <s> on the other hand glasgow considered profligate by many members on the other side is per cent <e> <s> in excess of guidelines considerably less than others <e> <s> this matter goes much deeper than has been argued <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we are all grateful that we have had this debate today although once again we are going over a great deal of the ground that was covered in a much earlier debate supplemented by the statement that we had some weeks ago <e> <s> i believe that it is due to the persistence of the noble baroness lady burton that we have had this debate today and we should be grateful to the noble baroness for that <e>", "<cs> i rise merely perhaps to help the minister apart from anything else and to give him time to get some information <e> <s> i think my noble friend lord shepherd and the noble lords lord sandford and lord lloyd of kilgerran have made points to which the government obviously have been paying and will need to pay more attention <e> <s> there is a difficulty <e> <s> i was not privy to any letter from any lady to which my noble friend lord shepherd referred <e> <s> therefore i was not even aware that there would be changes in schedule other than an assurance through the usual channels that there would be two purely technical changes <e> <s> it now appears as though the changes will be more substantial than purely technical changes <e> <s> it is therefore rather important that we have them before us as early as possible and i think the minister should make an effort to give us a date <e> <s> for instance we are concerned to have them well before third reading when further amendments may be needed <e> <s> i hope that the government will stretch the rules of the house to <e>", "<cs> this has been a most interesting amendment in that it has attracted so many noble lords and noble baronesses to discuss it <e> <s> i should first clear up a point raised by the noble baroness lady carnegy when she spoke about strathclyde <e> <s> i had said merely that it may be necessary to consider special measures to protect a local rail service in certain areas <e> <s> the situation has been put to us because of bus competition <e> <s> i mentioned strathclyde as an example and said that there might be a conflict about a railway concern <e> <s> it is correct to say that we are not considering this <e> <s> my view is that the good traditions of the house shall be upheld <e> <s> the bill has been accepted from the other place and there will be no wrecking amendments <e> <s> but we believe that the bill is of such major importance that it is better to have a smooth transition to the system that the government seek despite the fact that we are not happy about the system than that there should be a total mix up and mess when deregulation comes <e>", "<cs> i wish to support my noble friend <e> <s> i cannot see anything to which the minister or the government are likely to take exception <e> <s> there is only the point made by my noble friend that this might be considered slightly bureaucratic <e> <s> i believe however that those people who wait at places such as russell square to catch night buses to scotland and the north would feel a great deal more secure that the bus would start at the right time if a timetable was published that could be relied upon <e> <s> they would be happier if the organisation running the coach service was responsible to some official authority for providing services leaving at say or pm in order to reach their destination at a certain time the next day <e> <s> the passengers would know that this was not simply a matter left in the hands of the bus company <e> <s> they would know that if something went wrong there would be some body to which they could make representation <e> <s> it would not merely be the case of an inspector saying i am sorry <e> <s> the bus has broken down <e> <s> there is no alternative <e> <s> you will just have to wait another day or travel up during the day <e> <s> that could perhaps upset some important domestic or working arrangements <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend lord shepherd and the noble lord lord teviot on this amendment <e> <s> i should like particularly to speak about commuter services partly because the scottish peers were approached by a group of operators many of them private and very good and long established <e> <s> one of them appealed to me and to the noble baroness lady elliott of harwood over the problems of people commuting from lanark to glasgow <e> <s> that is a good example of miles and for many years now these people have provided a good and reliable service if part of it can be done on the motorway which fits in with the argument put forward earlier by my noble friend lord shepherd <e> <s> but at miles probably something like or in a straight line which i believe is the definition that is used it would mean that they would still not qualify <e>", "<cs> i understand that a passenger transport vehicle may fail its first test on quite minor matters such as the bell not working or even two or three interior bulbs not working <e> <s> but the vital part is the mechanical side <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister can say either now or later whether we are comparing like with like <e> <s> we are really concerned with faults affecting the safety of the vehicle and its passengers <e>", "<cs> this is as the noble lord lord monk bretton has said a fairly simple administrative amendment <e> <s> during the committee stage in another place the parliamentary under-secretary said that he was prepared to give clear instructions to the traffic commissioners that they must notify districts and counties affected by <e>", "<cs> it is a great pleasure in many ways for me to follow the noble lord lord marsh who was my chief for a period in the ministry of transport <e> <s> i am sorry that he seems to have used the opportunity to discuss what i know is a very real problem that he and my noble friend lord shepherd had in their terms as chairmen of nationalised industries <e> <s> i suggest to him with very great respect because i have a lot of respect for his ability that he was using this clause quite wrongly to voice his views on cross-subsidisation <e>", "<cs> that is an interpretation which i and many noble lords would find difficulty in agreeing with <e> <s> the noble earl lord de la warr has great experience in this industry and speaks with a great deal of concern and worry because like all of us he wants the industry to survive and grow <e> <s> he spoke most tellingly about the real purpose of these amendments which is to fill the very major gaps that we are afraid may appear <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> as he said later this evening we hope to be dealing with amendment no <e> <s> and we shall go into the whole question again <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i agree with the minister and welcome his assurances but i hope the government are not proposing different treatment for different classes of operator <e> <s> any change necessary should be applicable to whichever operator requires it and it should not be done on the basis of the type of operator <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the assurances were helpful <e> <s> it is extremely important that continuity is guaranteed and that there is not a sudden withdrawal of an operator at a most inopportune time <e> <s> while i can see the difficulty in the method of a bond suggested by the noble baroness lady vickers i hope that the government will give very serious consideration to the whole question of the reliability of services and as i think will be raised in some later amendments the question of making sure that the financial capability of any prospective operator is such that they will not suddenly fold up <e> <s> while as i say the bond is perhaps not the best way to do it i hope the government are aware that it is a very important measure that the noble baroness is suggesting for the protection of the public <e>", "<cs> i hope that the last words of the noble lord lord monk bretton were listened to by the minister that he would take it away and look at it and not make a hasty decision tonight because i think this is a subject that is going to come up again and again <e> <s> it came up earlier today when we were discussing amendment no <e> <s> it was raised in the commons committee and i do not think that it is something that is going to be easily pushed off <e>", "<cs> i think there is a complication here <e> <s> the minister seems to have been satisfied but the point raised whether it is the first or the second traffic commissioner who should transmit the information is something i shall take away and look at <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the point of the lower standard is as the noble lord lord tordoff said that taking a cheaper vehicle or a vehicle that is cheaper to run could exploit in rural areas any good traffic which would be much more expensive for the local authorities since they would be subsidising much heavier and much more expensive vehicles <e> <s> there is a point there <e> <s> although the amendment talks about safety standards they are obviously reflected in costs <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> had given notice of his intention to move as motion a that this house do insist on their amendment no <e> <s> to which the commons have disagreed for the reason numbered <e>", "<cs> had given notice of his intention to move as motions a b c and d that this house do not insist on their amendments no <e> <s> to to which the commons disagree for the reason numbered but propose the following amendments in lieu thereof <e>", "<cs> had given notice of his intention to move as motion a that this house do insist on their amendments nos <e> <s> to to which the commons disagreed for the reason numbered <e>", "<cs> it is always a delicate matter to enter into the question of the taxi fleet <e> <s> one is bound to stand on someones toes <e> <s> as the noble lord lord renton says the clause does not apply to scotland but scotland is given as an illustration in the notes on clauses <e> <s> i am not sure whether we got it right in the scottish civic government legislation in but i do not have the same experience as the noble baroness lady carnegy that there is no sale of plates in glasgow and edinburgh <e> <s> there is still a considerable sale perhaps not at but certainly at a fair figure <e>", "<cs> does the minister not agree that in view of the speech of his noble friend lord teviot there is a certain amount of worry about the whole question of mini-buses <e> <s> while we all appreciate that going as far as a special licence is perhaps too much would not the minister at least applaud the method used in certain local authorities derbyshire comes to mind but there are others where the local authority itself holds insurance on the buses and mini-buses <e> <s> the authority therefore owns the buses and hires or gives them out to the schools the clubs or community centres <e> <s> i believe it is done in certain parts of scotland too <e>", "<cs> i should like very much to support the noble earl lord de la warr on the question of there being conditions <e> <s> i would say that the conditions he has outlined in the new clause to which my name is attached as well as his own are fairly elementary and common sense <e>", "<cs> had given notice of his intention to move amendment no <e>", "<cs> that is rather helpful of the noble lord lord tordoff <e> <s> while the minister has said that this is a simplification to us it is just an over-simplification <e> <s> we should want to raise quite a number of points on it <e> <s> if there was any possibility of our amendment being negatived on the new clause which would mean that we should not be able to raise it again at a later stage i should certainly not wish that <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for explaining the new clauses and the amendments <e> <s> the underlying principle of consolidating the references to management of bus stations is generally welcomed but as i said earlier the government have still failed to address certain points <e> <s> that is why we felt the use of bus stations by bodies other than ptes and local authorities for example was rather restrictive <e> <s> there is no need for them to use them <e> <s> securing the continued use of bus stations interchanges turning places and shelters which have been provided at public expense will not necessarily be brought about and severe traffic problems could be caused by operators choosing not to use bus stations interchanges or proper turning facilities <e>", "<cs> the minister has explained very reasonably his objections to the amendments and has tried to give an explanation of how he sees the bill operating <e> <s> the noble lord was absolutely correct in saying that this is a complicated string of amendments <e> <s> i believe however that the amendments are an attempt to examine a very complicated method of operating a bus service <e> <s> i am in complete agreement on one issue at least with the noble earl lord de la warr there is nothing political in this <e> <s> it is a business arrangement connected with running the transport service in an area <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that helpful answer <e> <s> it appears to me from the example that there is a certain unfairness because of a lack of evenhandedness <e> <s> perhaps the minister will look at it and come back <e> <s> may i ask that when he is looking at it he will appreciate that this amendment and the others relating to the powers and duties of elected local authorities have been specifically related to non-metropolitan authorities pending the final passage of the local government bill and that it will be necessary for us to review at report the corresponding provisions for the metropolitan authorities <e> <s> i would let him know that this was specifically aimed at the non-metropolitan authorities at this stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most disappointed with the minister <e> <s> the noble lord made the accusation that we were trying to introduce an iron fist <e> <s> i had the feeling while he was speaking and this is most unlike him that he was using an iron fist on the amendment <e> <s> he showed an aggressiveness which is most unlike him <e> <s> i think that the aggressiveness clouded his thinking <e> <s> every local authority that is a traffic authority whether it is a pte or a county council will need to produce a map whether before or after <e> <s> it is the only way to look at an area and get a picture of it unless you have a particularly analytical mind and can read all these routes from a timetable <e> <s> a map is needed <e>", "<cs> the committee will be grateful to the minister for the persuasive way he put his case and also for the fact that he emphasised the difficulties if there was phasing <e> <s> i agree with my <e>", "<cs> i think the ministers amendment and the amendment that has been moved by the noble lord lord monk bretton demonstrate the great confusion about how this rural grant will be handled <e> <s> my noble friend lord shepherd has just made a point about whether someone starting up in business will go into it for a four-year period <e> <s> when the minister was speaking earlier he said that operators will know that they are getting a grant and the formula has been suggested by the government <e> <s> but do operators realise that the grant will be roughly p per mile <e> <s> the minister has not yet accepted the figure given by the noble earl lord de la warr which shows that the grant would work out at about p a mile <e> <s> that really amounts to one extra passenger which i can hardly believe is something that will attract people into the industry <e>", "<cs> would the minister also give a little thought to some of the rural areas that i know reasonably well in the west of scotland <e> <s> i take the point that a works bus is really a moral abuse if not a legal abuse with having a couple of seats vacant <e> <s> but it happens in school buses <e> <s> i know parts of the clyde coast which are fairly sparsely populated <e> <s> there may be a valley with children going down to school and there is a small town and there may be only half a dozen genuinely empty seats on the bus maybe different people taking them every day <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that comprehensive reply <e> <s> as this is a subject of some complexity i am sure he will accept that both myself and i imagine the noble baroness lady elliott of harwood will wish to study his response with some care <e> <s> i thank the noble lord for his reply and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for these corrections <e> <s> i am somewhat disappointed that the minister took this politically <e> <s> the question of the scottish lines and the ayr line was not intended to be political <e> <s> if one wants to be political then the only political thing i can say is that one knows where the end of that line from glasgow goes and perhaps the secretary of state had a special reason for putting it down there <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i think this has all been extremely interesting <e> <s> so many people have a great knowledge of the newcastle metro <e> <s> i must confess that although i was up there when it was starting i have not been able to get back to newcastle during the time that it has been running as efficiently as everyone tells me <e> <s> people of all parties have told me how good it is <e> <s> i have seen the videos and read the literature about it <e> <s> i am also aware that a study has just been completed with the trrl the university of newcastle the tyne and wear county council and the tyne and wear passenger transport executive and that this report is likely to be out by the end of october <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble baroness lady elliot i am disappointed as i am sure are the people of scotland who asked us to raise this matter <e> <s> they are not destructive people <e> <s> they will be rather disappointed <e> <s> i was sorry that the minister could only give the same example that he <e>", "<cs> my lords although i can see the point of some of the arguments which the minister has put and if i thought that his perfect competition worked properly i would be very happy i suspect that a great many problems will be arising <e> <s> certain operators will continue to do things on the cheap particularly people who have very little capital and who as suggested by the secretary of state spend their redundancy money <e> <s> they will not be willing to use a bus station and will tend to use the street <e> <s> in one experiment we saw that even the repairs were done in the street <e> <s> i realise that a local authority can at some point compel operators to use a bus station or can put them off a particular pan of the road but this all takes a considerable time <e>", "<cs> my lords my interpretation is that if the local authority want to use traffic regulations and conditions and ask the traffic commissioner he will need to say you cannot park in the street for certain services <e> <s> you must use the bus station <e> <s> that is what the noble lord was asking about <e> <s> so there would be that compulsion if this amendment were accepted because it would be at the request of the local authority who would have to give proper reasons to the traffic commissioner <e> <s> he would be a responsible person and would not do something frivolously <e> <s> there will be occasions when good operators will use a bus station and its facilities because it is more convenient <e> <s> there may be offices there and places for collecting money <e> <s> that will cost <e>", "<cs> my lords in terms of taxi inspection certainly in london it is not the police who do the vehicle inspection <e> <s> i believe that has changed has it not <e> <s> i think the public carriage office do it now not the police <e> <s> i am open to correction but i understood that this was not something done by the police themselves there were special inspectors <e>", "<cs> my lords i would need to take advice on the point raised by the noble lord lord renton as to who would do the inspection <e> <s> i would have thought there would be i think the noble lord the minister has an answer now as to who does the inspection in other places but there would be a local authority <e> <s> i am sorry i need to take that back and look at it <e> <s> i cannot give an answer now <e>", "<cs> my lords this was a probing amendment and the minister has covered most of the points raised <e> <s> i should like to ask whether the minister knows or can find out when there will be new legislation and what steps will be taken <e> <s> i know he cannot reply now but it would be interesting to know when a statement can be made on when a formal examination of existing licensing laws for taxis will be started and what legislation will be likely to come out of it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the secretary of state for scotland has already made it very clear that he is so impatient with his own government that he is very likely to be producing his own legislation and that as he said just last week he may very well go it alone <e> <s> can we perhaps have some nice competition between the two sides or parts of the united kingdom that are rating authorities to see who can come up first with the better solution <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for taking it in that spirit <e> <s> i think that the difficulty between us may lie in the formulation of general policy <e> <s> perhaps only annually six-monthly or every two years in the determining of policy the authority will need to have more than a general look at transport in the area <e> <s> i do not intend it to be an interfering busybody authority but it will need to raise the money to provide the noncommercial services and will have difficult decisions to make <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am grateful to the minister for his kind words his promise to look at this and his acceptance of the fact that there are one or two minor imperfections in the bill that may need dusting and tidying up <e> <s> however he has put me in the position where we feel that it is important that there should be the opportunity to use every possible available means of transport in the area of public transport <e> <s> many of us have tried every way to get the most out of transport in terms of school buses post buses and special authority buses <e> <s> this amendment is merely giving the opportunity for the metropolitan authorities to be able to do this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the minister will realise that that is a very disappointing reply <e> <s> the noble lord has given very little <e> <s> i took notes of what he was suggesting <e> <s> he said that competition will reduce costs <e> <s> that is always the case in this bill and it may be true but we are talking about very large initial costs to be carried by these ptes <e> <s> the minister says that there is a different view of services in the pte areas but surely he does not believe that the points i made the cost of establishing new companies redundancy costs the costs of the surplus assets can be just wished away <e> <s> they are very important things <e> <s> if there are surplus assets the problem will be trying to realise them in a depressed market <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful for that but the whole tenor of the rest of the speech of the noble lord lord trefgarne was rather negative <e> <s> in order to give him an opportunity to look again at the detailed points i have made i would rather <e>", "<cs> my lords i also support this amendment which does not demand any new power but would merely give the secretary of state the opportunity of using the powers he has <e> <s> it has been pointed out by the noble lords lord teviot and lord tordoff that there is a problem concerning the <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord the minister sits down he stated that the example of the national freight corporation was not applicable <e> <s> i have been speaking merely on the basis of information i have been given and i only want to reassure various people who have approached me about this matter as to whether there is a difference between how sealink british telecom and the road construction units are being treated as against those employed in the area of passenger transport <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for the help which he has given <e> <s> there is just one point which continually worries me about this <e> <s> when you think of the bus stations of the national bus company these have all been paid for ultimately by the fare-paying passenger no matter how circuitous the route was and we have two in glasgow and one at victoria <e> <s> it is the fare-paying passenger who has ultimately supplied them and i do think that your lordships will need to look very carefully at the new clause that the government have tabled to see if it really does open up the bus stations or makes it possible for them to be opened up under competition law <e> <s> however on the assurance that the noble lord the minister has given me i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords briefly i would like to support the previous speakers on this amendment <e> <s> there is little more to be said except perhaps to repeat the salient fact that we are not asking that a great deal of public money be used in these three categories relative to the sums already spent on concessionary fares the sums involved here to allow for the categories mentioned that is the profoundly deaf and the mentally handicapped <e> <s> the figure is really very small indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords although i have heard what the minister has to say i am sure he will realise that there is still a great deal of dissatisfaction <e> <s> i am sorry that we have not had time to go into what i consider will be one of the fundamental questions that is the concessionary schemes and whether or not tokens will be used <e> <s> that will be something which will be of great annoyance to very many people and also a threat to a great many people <e> <s> however having heard what the minister has had to say and realising how short a time we have left i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> it is slightly unfair to suggest that i put up an amendment and then shot it down <e> <s> the amendment was not put on the marshalled list today it was tabled some time ago and i did not know then that the meeting was going to take place <e> <s> obviously i agree with the minister that we cannot take one impression of the meeting <e> <s> minutes are always taken of such meetings and then they are agreed <e> <s> however i have no reason to believe that mr mitchell is not dissatisfied as are most people with the present method of procedure at these inquiries <e> <s> indeed the very fact and i think that it must be taken as a fact that he suggested that the local authorities the tuccs and the british railways board should be reminded of what can be done at a public inquiry at least shows that although the present procedure may be appropriate nevertheless it may have either fallen into disuse over the years or it may in some ways be faulted <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord de la warr explained fully the purpose of this amendment and why my name and that of the noble lord lord tordoff were attached to <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is correct <e> <s> it is extremely difficult territory <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to say that i am not really satisfied with the explanation of the noble lord lord brabazon of tara <e> <s> i specifically spoke about the basic costs of redundancy surplus assets pensions and the company formation the initial cost <e> <s> it is not that i was ungrateful for his statement on revenue support <e> <s> the points i was making were really on the initial costs of setting up the companies <e> <s> i said these are impossible to fully identify until after the schemes have been <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> i am always amused that he is convinced and he has said this several times that we shall not have any spare buses <e> <s> between all the spare buses we are not going to have and all these coaches we are going to have on the roads they will be very crowded <e> <s> i am slightly helped by the fact that he said there are already powers in certain circumstances for the secretary of state to allow the hiring of these vehicles <e> <s> i thought that the government might have <e>", "<cs> my lords it is only right that i sincerely thank the minister for his acceptance of this amendment <e> <s> not only does it open up this matter but it makes it much tidier <e> <s> we are glad that the minister took heed of the last debate <e> <s> i thank him for accepting these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps this would be an opportune moment to make one or two brief observations on the bill <e> <s> apart from the second reading of the bill we have spent very full days and many late nights debating it <e> <s> it has been dealt with extremely thoroughly <e> <s> as everyone is aware it is a massive bill and very complex <e> <s> it is massive not just in terms of its size but also perhaps even more importantly in the purposes which lay behind the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should also declare an interest at the beginning <e> <s> my interest is that i was one of the early joint chairmen of the channel tunnel group in the s <e> <s> on every occasion on which i have had the opportunity i have consistently spoken in favour of a fixed link <e> <s> i must be quite honest and say that i have always been in favour of a tunnel <e> <s> in fact in those days it was always a tunnel that was discussed <e> <s> there was mooted for a period an elegant and imaginative design for a splendid twin tubular bridge which i considered and discussed with the people concerned but its development did not go as far as the proposals we have been given recently about the bridge <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously i must accept the much greater knowledge of the noble lord but if as we are told the city is awash with money it is difficult to believe that there would not be some of it still lapping around in two years time if that were the case <e> <s> the point i was making was slightly different from that of the noble lord lord kennet <e> <s> i was talking about resources and if britain decides to play her part in this tunnel the resources will still come from britain at least we hope so <e> <s> there is of course no guarantee of that and many of them may come from abroad but the resources will still be british resources whether the money is private or public <e> <s> perhaps i could get a tutorial from the noble lord at some time to clear up this point privately and not bore the house with it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble minister for explaining the order <e> <s> he will realise that when i saw on the order paper a reference to scottish roads i rather groaned because we had spent so long on it <e> <s> however on examination i found that it was fulfilling a promise made during the long committee stage of that bill <e> <s> it is something which will be of great help to people in scotland where there are very many examples of unfinished roads and people having great inconvenience in getting to their houses for which they have paid a great deal of money they also having paid for the road <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord as i am sure the whole house will be for introducing the bill and explaining some of its clauses and their effect <e> <s> we have a long list of speakers and i hope that i shall not delay the house too long <e> <s> i wish to deal with only one or two points and no doubt we shall be dealing with them in much greater detail if at the end of the evening the bill is given a second reading and goes into committee <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister confirm that british rail is considering a direct line to heathrow <e> <s> if so does this not confirm also the need for a direct line to stansted <e> <s> it seems to be bad housekeeping for the government to spend millions of pounds on the development of aircraft to save half an hour on a journey and then cause people to travel with great inconvenience to the airport to pick up the plane <e>", "<cs> it did not quite reach as long as the hour but it is amazing that such an amendment should have managed to take the time it has <e> <s> it is still a catch situation <e> <s> as my noble friend lord ross of marnock said if it was salmon leaving the river obviously there would already have been boards there and they would be entitled to stay in the hope that the salmon would come back <e> <s> but the problem is how you set up a board under the terms of the bill as it stands when assessment is necessary <e> <s> who becomes the chairman what is the proportion of voting and all the rest of it when there is no assessment possible because assessment is based on the fish in the river and there are none <e> <s> therefore it seems impossible to me <e>", "<cs> may i raise with the minister a point that is not connected with the substance of the amendments but merely relates to their order <e> <s> i do not blame anyone because it is a complicated bill with a very large number of amendments some of which were tabled very late but the selection list was late in coming through today <e> <s> i was told even when i received it a few minutes before <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his reply but i think that he is reading the amendment wrongly <e> <s> i do not blame him <e> <s> when i looked at it i was conscious of the fact that it should have come earlier in the bill and in another form <e> <s> i was endeavouring to include water bailiffs among the people whom the secretary of state appointed <e> <s> it is probably a clumsy way to do that <e>", "<cs> corroboration <e>", "<cs> in view of the point that the minister has made i think that perhaps we could dig back in the acts a wee bit more and perhaps get a few more examples that will help the minister to support anything we are able to bring forward at report stage <e> <s> i therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for making the statement may i ask him whether he can clear up the question of the timetable <e> <s> the noble lord says that we shall have until the end of july for consultation <e> <s> so comments which are bound to be fairly voluminous and many of them expert will only have been received by that time <e> <s> after that the government will need to consider them <e> <s> is the noble lord suggesting that a bill will be presented early in the next session <e> <s> if so the problem arises that the bill cannot be very thorough <e> <s> we have had a number of pieces of scottish legislation in respect of which new clauses have been written while the bill is going through the house as the government re-think their policy <e> <s> on the other hand the bill cannot surely be left until too late in the session because it will be an extremely controversial measure <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that it will take a long time in the other place and i am sure a long time here <e> <s> the government would seem to be very optimistic if they believe that they can get a proper bill out of what i consider a botched green paper within the proposed timetable <e>", "<cs> i do not want to get involved in a detailed argument about english law but what worries me about this particular clause is the strong new powers that are being given <e> <s> i accept that there is only one law but nevertheless there is a suspicion that this particular power would have been looked at much more closely and been the subject of more resistance in scotland generally had the bill not been pushed forward on the basis of the large-scale damaging gang-type poaching that is in progress <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister very briefly when he is considering this also to look at the question of miles <e> <s> i understand that miles means statute miles <e> <s> is there any way of putting that into the bill <e> <s> i think it has been raised once or twice before perhaps if we could get the term statute miles put into the legislation that would help a number of people like myself reading it in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the minister will look sympathetically at this amendment <e> <s> it seems wrong that important powers should be given to a board to represent such a valuable asset without having a meeting at least once a year <e> <s> if this or a similar amendment is not accepted it would mean as i see it and according to the noble lord lord burton that meetings would be held only every third year <e> <s> i know that the minister usually finds that the wording of amendments is not quite what he wants but perhaps he can indicate that he is in general sympathetic to it being part of the duties of the board to meet at least once a year to let people know what is happening and to give a report of their stewardship for the year <e> <s> i think that this is the least that can be done in such a bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that there are special circumstances particularly in remote areas where it would be very difficult <e> <s> i am merely concerned that the individual who is appointed should be someone who is approved by someone other than merely the board <e> <s> to be giving these powers to someone who is appointed by an unrepresentative board every other example i gave involved at least the local authority or the secretary of state even to be a window-cleaner you must get the local authoritys approval and you must probably have your name passed over the chief constables desk in order to get the approval <e> <s> all i am suggesting is that that should be the minimum <e> <s> after they are appointed and approved they have the same powers as the noble lord is suggesting are vital for a water bailiff <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that when we read <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like just very briefly on behalf of my noble friend lord ross of marnock and myself to thank the noble lords lord gray of contin and lord belstead for the great patience and forbearance which they have shown during this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble baroness lady stedman for raising this very important matter <e> <s> i think that it gives us an opportunity to go perhaps slightly wider than merely the line which she was discussing and to consider what the right reverend prelate referred to in his as he said non-controversial speech <e> <s> he was quite persuasive enough without being controversial <e> <s> he said that we should look a little more closely at the whole idea of closing this line <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak briefly on this question <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord teviot for his initial explanation and also to my noble friend lord williams of elvel for his further clarification of what is quite clearly an unclear matter and a quite difficult subject <e> <s> my concern is largely with whether this will affect the ordinary holidaymakers who want to go abroad by coach where most of the problems seem to arise in terms of the failure of companies <e> <s> i understand from some information i have been given that for instance this year there will be over million people booked through the bonded holiday arrangements of the coach council and they will book through abta travel agents <e> <s> will this cease now or will the bus and coach council require to pay some fee to take part in the abta arrangements for insurance purposes should anything go wrong with the holiday <e>", "<cs> my lords i must thank the minister for the explanation that he has given of this bill <e> <s> we in this house have the advantage in dealing with a bill such as this of having had the ability to look at the committee stage in another place <e> <s> i am sure the minister will have read reports of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord marshall for giving us the opportunity to debate this subject today <e> <s> it will come as no surprise that few noble lords on this side of the house agree with many of his conclusions but i think that the more discussion that takes place and the more light that can be shed on the different proposals and problems involved in local rating and the payment for local services the better it is for everyone <e> <s> it is not an easy subject <e> <s> it is an extremely complicated subject as i think we have discovered today if we did not know it before from all the points of view that have been put forward so far <e>", "<cs> my lords on the question of revaluation i have never understood and the noble lord seemed to compound my confusion why a sudden increase in valuation should drastically affect the rates as much as he seemed to suggest between the north and the south <e> <s> why should the total sum paid by any householder in rates increase as much as the value of the house in the south or decrease as much in the north as he seemed to suggest <e> <s> it has always been a source of confusion to me and the minister has compounded it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord ferrier for giving us the opportunity to speak on this aspect of the bill the delay of the bill and not the total and outright condemnation and rejection of the bill <e> <s> it seems a sensible and reasonable amendment to put forward at this time <e> <s> i am sorry that the situation is such that sometimes in a local authority important things that affect all the citizens quite apart from what i consider to be purely party politics become a party political issue <e> <s> that is unfortunate <e> <s> if this amendment is carried and if there is a change in the composition of the new regional council i hope that it will sit down and look with fresh eyes at what is proposed in order to see whether such a relief road is needed <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that i hoped they would reconsider their attitude <e> <s> i do not know enough about the composition of the lothian group <e> <s> i just feel that matters such as this should not be tied up with party politics as they sometimes are and i am speaking as a very committed party person <e>", "<cs> my lords i think perhaps the use of the term expressway was a technical one <e> <s> i used it loosely <e> <s> it is a technical term meaning that there are no impediments <e> <s> it does not necessarily mean that it is a fast road in technical terms <e> <s> it does not mean it has a mile an hour limit it means that there are no junctions or lights and people go through <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support my noble friend lord galpern in his statement <e> <s> i believe that he put it extremely clearly and we must remember that he was part of the commission that looked at the problem <e> <s> in the last week i have endeavoured to find out more about one particular part of the decision and i speak following on the speech of the minister the noble lord lord gray of contin <e> <s> the more i have examined and the more information i have the more i realise just how important this decision is to the lothian region now and in the future for quite a period ahead <e>", "<cs> my lords you will not be surprised to hear that i agree with the last remark of the noble lord lord tordoff <e> <s> the content of the bill has been subjected to the will of the treasury <e> <s> this shows that ideology is not always pursued simply by those on this side of the house <e> <s> it would be surprising if we ever had a bill on airports in respect of which the noble baroness lady burton did not plough her furrow about the importance of gatwick and the second runway <e> <s> this time the noble baroness has at least one open convert <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter spoke in favour of it <e> <s> i have never understood why this agreement of all agreements made by governments was so sacrosanct since all governments in past years <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry <e> <s> i should have realised that <e> <s> even then one would have thought that a government willing to go to the enormous expense of stansted would have looked more closely at the likelihood of expansion at <e>", "<cs> my lords that is very doubtful <e> <s> those of us who have been in the other place know that if an issue becomes important the postbag becomes bigger and bigger as happened not so very long ago in the other place when the postbag became very large <e> <s> the member of parliament pays a great deal of attention to it and ensures that he makes respresentation to the minister <e> <s> it can be very direct and can have a very telling effect on the action of the minister <e> <s> i think that it is obviously a matter for debate but i would rather have the democracy of the ballot box than the democracy of the small shareholder trying to change the world <e>", "<cs> there are two points <e> <s> there is the point made by the noble lord lord mackie of benshie on houses built for farm workers when i imagine in general at a fairly advanced age they retire and these houses are then taken up profitably for sale as holiday homes <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for promising to write to me <e> <s> i think i should <e>", "<cs> i cannot understand the minister <e> <s> i can see his point that the whole object was to sell as many houses and flats as possible <e> <s> but i believe that he is missing and the philosophy of the bill is missing one of the vitally important points of our whole argument <e> <s> the noble earl lord selkirk and others from all parts of the committee have travelled through some of these cities in the last few years and have seen the enormous improvements that have been made largely due to enthusiasm by housing associations <e>", "<cs> if per cent <e> <s> of houses is divided among a fairly large number of housing associations it means that each of them does not have many pre- houses <e> <s> if we scale the figures down in that way we realise the effort that has been made by local people in preserving and making a valuable contribution to the housing stock <e> <s> it could not be considered to be massive <e> <s> the housing is not necessarily the most important part of the contribution but as i said on second reading that has had an effect on areas which would not otherwise have been saved <e>", "<cs> this amendment was not moved previously but was merely discussed with other amendments <e> <s> i hope that the minister if he is unwilling to accept the amendment will give some explanation as to why he is unable to accept it <e> <s> surely this amendment has to be moved as we reach it <e>", "<cs> i should like to move the amendment <e> <s> roughly the same argument applies as was put before to the noble lord the minister concerning smaller buildings containing four flats or fewer within them <e> <s> the noble lord lord mackie of benshie has his signature to this amendment as well <e> <s> they are homes that not only go without trouble but are also in considerable demand <e> <s> i therefore hope that the minister will give the committee a slightly better explanation than he did in respect of the amendment we discussed earlier concerning buildings of no more than two storeys <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the minister but on looking more closely at the amendment i do not have the script but i am sure this was my fault i find that i have there the word not which rather disturbs matters <e> <s> i apologise to the committee because that changes the entire balance of the amendment <e> <s> it should have read <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his explanation <e> <s> i hope he has taken the point both from what i said and from what my noble friend lord ross of marnock said that we want more flexibility <e> <s> we are not tying the government down to anything <e> <s> we want flexibility and that is why i considered that amendment no <e> <s> seemed logical as it gives the secretary of state power to add to the categories again giving him flexibility without tying him down <e> <s> this is something that we should consider on report to see what the minister has to say about it then <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that very full explanation <e> <s> i do not think he need apologise for its length because this is a very important subject <e> <s> i am sure he will equally realise that that sort of reply needs a certain amount of expertise and i do not have the benefit of that to the extent that he does <e> <s> perhaps he will accept that if we withdraw the amendment we shall want it looked at by those who are involved and will want to leave ourselves free to bring it back at report stage <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend lord wells-pestell for raising this subject and giving us all the chance to speak on it <e> <s> i think his own speech was moving caring and gentle <e> <s> of course there was a certain amount of indignation in it but i think even to suggest that his speech reflected the politics of envy was a gross distortion of anything he tried to say <e> <s> in contrast to that i was thinking about how i would categorise the noble lord lord young who made the accusation <e> <s> i thought of many things but one of the gentlest things i could think of was what pangloss said about everything being for the best in the best of all possible worlds <e> <s> we have heard this frequently from the noble lord lord young of graffham <e> <s> i believe that what has come across from this side at least is evidence that the rest of britain does not think that things are quite as easy and they are not quite as smug as noble lords opposite appear to be <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that i have had correspondence from people in canada who in addition to feeling let down by not being given increments from the united kingdom are concerned about the great delay in even the existing pension being sent to them in some areas a delay of four or five weeks <e> <s> they have been in contact with newcastle but they have not been able to get an improvement <e> <s> will the noble baroness please look into this to see whether anything can be done so that pensions can be paid at the proper time <e>", "<cs> my lords i was disappointed at the ministers reply he will not be surprised to hear that when he said things such as that the selling off of houses will not impair the viability of the associations <e> <s> when it is realised that we are looking at housing associations with less than houses i do not think that he is right at all <e> <s> i cannot believe that small associations particularly the ones mentioned earlier and the figures were given by the noble earl lord dundee at the last stage of this bill such as the associations with less than houses would not be affected <e> <s> if these houses begin to be unavailable because people buy them obviously that will be important <e> <s> but even more important than the stock of houses will be the effect on people who have given their time to set up the associations to try to save a bit of their community <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great care to what the minister has said <e> <s> i was rather surprised that he could not find a definition for community-based associations not because i have one that i can pluck out of the air <e> <s> it is one of those things that i always thought i knew what it was but may be rather like a camel you know what it is and you can describe it but that is about all <e> <s> i am sure that we could find a definition <e> <s> i could have understood that there might be problems about defining what actually constitutes four-storey property there could be problems there <e> <s> i am disappointed that the minister has not taken this point <e>", "<cs> my lords there is little in the governments views on this matter to which we could honestly object though we object to the general principle <e> <s> since we were talking earlier about definitions may i ask whether there is a definition of what used to be called an essential worker someone who had to have accommodation close to his work <e> <s> the noble lord may remember that on one of the earlier scottish bills we discussed education property in island communities and i think we had to win a vote in order to get the accommodation of the government so that a house necessary for educational purposes on an island was not able to <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am sorry <e> <s> perhaps i should have started by saying that <e> <s> i am now going to deal very briefly with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> this is the amendment of the noble lord <e> <s> lord mackie of benshie and he will speak to that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply and particularly for pointing out my mistake in the wording of the amendment <e> <s> i shall certainly look at that with great care <e> <s> obviously it is not an amendment that could be accepted in its present form but i give notice to the minister that i shall pursue the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will realise that i am a little disappointed with his reply <e> <s> he said that the secretary of state had plenty of expertise to help him look at current problems <e> <s> we are not desperately concerned about that <e> <s> we know that there is plenty of expertise to look at current problems but frequently a solution is found that is neither long term nor lasting nor even at the end of the day economic <e> <s> the matters that concern me are for instance the replacement of about houses a year in order just to stand still let alone build for new stock <e>", "<cs> my lords i can certainly understand the ministers problem here <e> <s> i am of course aware too of the other problems that have been faced by local authorities since the act was originally put on the statute book <e> <s> this case has shown a gross mistake in the act <e> <s> there is no question of the law lords doing other than what was absolutely <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to say something on this point <e> <s> the noble earl lord selkirk has made a powerful case <e> <s> the point he made that worried me most was that if charities were selling off their houses if they were forced to do so because they were being asked by the tenants there would be no incentive for anyone thereafter to buy blocks or build blocks for charities <e> <s> one housing charity i do not know the status of it but i have some association with it is christian action <e> <s> it has a very special kind of use for its houses <e> <s> it is not just a case of trying to solve someones housing problem <e> <s> it uses its houses to try to solve a much wider problem than just the housing problem a much wider family problem <e> <s> its houses i should think are really worth much more to it than they are to any one individual family <e>", "<cs> we are all grateful for the great effort that the minister has obviously made to try to find a way out of the problem <e> <s> he spoke of being glad to see safeguards in the bill but those safeguards really have little relevance to the very serious problem that we are discussing <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter was rather concerned with the brutal stripping of assets and with the closing down of an airport <e> <s> the danger is possibly much more subtle than that <e>", "<cs> i can see the difficulty confronting the minister and the committee <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl also recognises just how serious is this matter and will take it back <e> <s> in the light of the assurance that he has given and in particular his last contribution i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his explanation and for his remarks on my proposed new clauses <e> <s> i am also grateful for the kind words of the noble lord lord tordoff and also for the flattering words although i am not so sure about this as to the soporific quality of my speech made by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> on reflection i believe that it is perhaps too much to ask that this should be embodied as the noble lord lord tordoff said in tablets of stone <e> <s> we were concerned really to raise this matter and to obtain the good offices of the minister in order that the british airports authority plc or its successor will recognise the feeling of people for the existing negotiating machinery <e> <s> i was glad to note that the minister said that contracts of <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lord lord tordoff on this amendment <e> <s> i am disappointed that the minister has fallen back on the narrow definition including grant as part of the turnover <e> <s> he conceded that some airports would require grant or subsidy from the local authority <e> <s> it struck me then as being unfortunate that he did not give them any credit for making this subsidy <e>", "<cs> obviously i am disappointed though i remember the discussion which took place some time ago on this very point of representation <e> <s> what i think people find difficult to understand is that of all the people who may be appointed to a board or selected for a board only those representing the workers may have difficulty in genuinely representing the prosperity of the company <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl at least for his honesty on the way he will approach this matter <e> <s> i do not think it is a good message to go from such a gathering as this to people employed in the airports industry that they of all people will have no right on the face of the bill to be represented <e> <s> it is fine to say that we must wait until there is major legislation that will do the whole job but i do not believe that it would be too difficult to make a slight start in this bill <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord tordoff said that this had become known as the roger taylor amendment <e> <s> while undoubtedly mr taylor has been a great driving force in the development of manchester airport there is a big principle involved here <e> <s> the principle as i see it is that the government are speaking with two voices when they say that they want to establish an arms length relationship between the local authorities and the airports <e> <s> this is explained in clause <e> <s> however we shall soon be discussing clause where the government are treating airports as part of local authorities especially in terms of finance <e> <s> they are making very difficult any separation when the activities of the companies formed to run the airports will be treated as an absolutely integral part of local government in terms of financial liability and of capital expenditure <e> <s> it seems that there is a great inconsistency here <e> <s> it is not just a question of manchester airport which is perhaps an outstanding example <e> <s> there is a principle involving airports not so large as manchester <e> <s> i hope that the minister will take on board this contradiction and give the matter more consideration <e>", "<cs> i think we should be grateful that the minister has promised to take this away and look at it <e> <s> every time i hear more discussion on this part of the bill i get more and more confused <e> <s> as i read the amendment of the noble earl lord <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his explanation <e> <s> i am always concerned when a minister tells me that a list is not exhaustive <e> <s> i have always understood in parliamentary terms that <e>", "<cs> i should of course have noticed and remembered that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter was a distinguished chairman of the caa <e> <s> i am sure that under his guidance there would be no question as to the width of consultation <e> <s> however everyone is not as punctilious as the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter and that is one of the reasons why we wished to have this on the face of the bill <e> <s> with that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> while thanking the minister for the explanation of the amendment as i see it the effect is to give the secretary of state even wider powers than he presently enjoys under the bill <e> <s> under the amendment provided that the secretary of state makes rules under the same subject matter which has been made the subject of consultation by the caa then the consultation requirements will be satisfied <e> <s> that may have been five years before the consultation was carried out <e> <s> this means that the secretary of state himself can determine without reference to anyone detailed rules in response to the caas current exercise <e>", "<cs> it is my intention to withdraw the amendment not that i think it is not an important amendment but because it is an amendment i hope to bring back at a later stage and perhaps clear up some of the points that i felt the minister misinterpreted <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> it is a reply that i should like to look at and have expert advice on <e> <s> i realise the incredible difficulty of trying to apportion the services about which i have spoken <e> <s> i will take the issue as far as it goes in good faith and will make a point of investigating it with some people who are knowledgeable in the field <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the minister for that explanation because it does seem to have cleared up a point which concerned me that it seemed on the surface that a report should be sent to the operator to the trade unions concerned and published <e> <s> i certainly can see the point that there may very well be information given in the report which should only really be seen by the secretary of state and by the operator concerned so that each of <e>", "<cs> i can see the problem that the noble lord lord mountevans has we do not have quite the same problem in scotland <e> <s> i remind the committee that when sunday opening was debated this side of the chamber made a totally free vote except in terms of those who were employed on the premises that would be open on a sunday <e> <s> i myself very much take the view that airport shops should be open but that there should be protection for the shop assistants and others who have to work in them for perhaps rather long hours <e> <s> in general i support amendment no <e> <s> b with the proviso that if it is carried we could introduce at a later stage some protection for the employees <e>", "<cs> may i briefly add to the words of the noble lord lord tordoff <e> <s> i too have great sympathy for the amendment and particularly appreciate the explicit way it was moved by the noble earl lord kinnoull <e> <s> it is a long and demanding amendment and the government will want time to look at it with some care <e> <s> i am sure they will want to give an opinion on the amendment and until we hear that opinion and perhaps the view that the government will bring it back slightly amended after discussions with the noble lord lord kings norton and the noble earl lord kinnoull i give general agreement and support to the amendment <e> <s> it is so complicated that i am sure the minister being what he is with the people he has behind him will find one or two reasons for not accepting the amendment in total <e> <s> however i hope he is willing to accept it in principle <e>", "<cs> i do not like to doubt the sagacity or intentions of the noble earl lord kinnoull <e> <s> if he were concerned about service contracts with regard to the letting of premises and franchises i should see the point of the amendment <e> <s> as i said during the debate on sunday trading i am keen to try to defend the employees of such organisations <e> <s> unfortunately many service contracts have a bad reputation with regard to wages hours of work the provision for sickness pensions and such matters <e> <s> if the noble earl had included maximum benefit or as the noble lord lord tordoff suggested optimum benefit <e>", "<cs> as a point of information are there any charges made for the vip lounges for instance <e> <s> i understand that in certain circumstances there is a charge made and i wonder if having gone that far we could not get a bit more information from the minister <e> <s> if it is true the minister could give us a bit more information concerning for instance how much he thinks it costs at different airports <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all very pleased to see new stations opened and many have been opened with the co-operation and finance of local authorities <e> <s> however is the minister aware that if the service is unreliable and we are finding that even with inter-city lack of punctuality as well as breakdowns are becoming more and more frequent the stations will hardly be able to cope and people will not use them <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether the figure of operating jobs which he mentioned represents the net employment gain of the channel tunnel if or when that link is built <e> <s> furthermore does that figure of jobs allow for the jobs that may be lost by workers at dover and the other seaports involved <e> <s> does the figure refer only to job numbers on this the british side of the channel <e> <s> can he say whether the french will have an equal number of job gains <e> <s> finally can he say how this will compare with the present number of french and british jobs associated with a sea link as against the number of future jobs likely to be associated with fixed link <e>", "<cs> my lords while we are glad that there will be new locomotives on the line and we hope that the noble lord lord oneill will get a smoother ride fairly soon is the minister aware that there is a growing feeling that reliability on both the express and intercity lines all over the country is not very good <e> <s> has he any figures showing the punctuality of intercity and express services over the last two or three years <e>", "<cs> my lords the house may remember that we discussed this matter at some length on th may when a very large number of members on all sides of the committee took part and i think it is fair to say showed a certain anxiety about it <e> <s> i also think that the minister himself realised that an important point was being made by those noble lords and he promised to come up with a form of words which he hoped would allay the fears that were raised <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i do have a note of that <e> <s> the paper i have in front of me merely contains the earlier answer <e> <s> i hope that i did not suggest that this house was not aware of the answer that had been given but i was using this particular piece of paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am rather disappointed at the noble earls reply <e> <s> we always get this argument that there is a safeguard for british telecom <e> <s> in this instance airports are special <e> <s> we are speaking particularly about the london airports and the possibly predatory intentions of certain other airports in europe <e> <s> there is no one from abroad suddenly going to take over british telecom and run it down in order to make the telephone companies of france germany or holland better <e> <s> there is no comparison <e> <s> it is a bad example to use and it has been used a number of times <e> <s> airports because of their international nature are special in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords i was paraphrasing the noble lords own words when he said <e> <s> provided the government carry out their intention <e> <s> all kinds of things flow from that <e> <s> there is some doubt unless we get it on the face of the bill <e> <s> of course no minister would give his name to something he did not intend to put into effect but why did the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter show a doubt himself <e> <s> the words may not be exactly as they are in the written answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his explanation <e> <s> he says that the proceeds of the sale by a local authority of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble viscount will realise that i and my noble friends find his reply a rather disappointing one <e> <s> we are not concerned about whether or not the intentions of the government are necessarily good <e> <s> of course expenditure has increased since for airports because air traffic is increasing and will go on doing so for a long time <e> <s> it would be very unlikely that for a matter of seven or eight years there would not be an increase in the capital investment in airports to account for this <e> <s> i am sorry if the noble viscount felt that i had dismissed his case earlier but i still feel that really he has missed the point <e> <s> the point is not whether the government or the civil aviation authority actually take account of all parts of the united kingdom when they are making decisions <e>", "<cs> my lords this is on another issue which perhaps we had better do without just now <e> <s> my point is that i am disappointed but i have tried it twice and we are not going to have the government accept it so i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thoroughly accept that this is a technical amendment in terms of its wording <e> <s> when one looks at it it is so technical that it is extremely difficult to understand <e> <s> that is one of the reasons i rise to ask the minister whether from his notes he can explain the purpose of the amendment to the house <e> <s> i am sure that if he is not able to do so he will write to me <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the minister for the gracious way in which he moved his amendments and also for the spirit in which he moved them <e> <s> i would also thank him for having written me with more explanation of the reasons for the amendment <e> <s> he will appreciate that i received the letter on a very complicated subject only today <e> <s> without the slightest reservation i accept his good faith <e> <s> as he said in the letter already we know that draftsmanship cannot always express exactly what was meant and intended by the house <e> <s> however largely because this house very wisely passed a couple of amendments there is an opportunity to look at the bill again in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his explanation <e> <s> from the information that i have received from those who are particularly specialised in this field it appears that this is a clearing-up of something that should be welcomed by everyone <e> <s> therefore we see no reason to oppose the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all disappointed not merely with the ministers reply but with the fact that the minister says that he agrees with the reply <e> <s> we have always had a much higher opinion of the minister than that <e> <s> however the noble lord made a number of points <e> <s> he said that the members of the association need not be members of the committee <e> <s> but everyone knows that in these organisations the committee members are the ones who have the drive <e> <s> the people within the organisations are likely to be the ones who started it and want to improve their locality <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with care to the minister and i should certainly like to give what he said considerably more thought <e> <s> i should like to raise two points <e> <s> first is there such a clause in english legislation <e> <s> i understand that no such clause applies to england and that means there is a difference in treatment between the two countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble lord lord mackie who moved the amendment and say that this is again a situation where much concern is shown by public opinion in scotland and by those who are very much involved in the problems of housing and particularly the housing of homeless people <e> <s> i have received the views of the dundee liaison committee on homelessness which urges us <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware of the excellent adjournment debate that was held in the other place on th may last when all-party feeling was that there was something very wrong with the rating system <e> <s> many other examples were then given besides those which we have heard of today from the noble baroness lady carnegy <e> <s> in my old constituency the western baths a modest but good local baths club pays per year while the rac club in pall mall which is at least times as large pays only <e> <s> we could go on giving examples <e> <s> will the noble lord the minister tell the house whether he has any information about the appeals which have been lodged with the assessor <e> <s> i know that the process is still going on but some may have been decided by now <e> <s> when the government meet cosla will they be able to help the hard-pressed local authorities to assist sports clubs by giving the local authorities any new money <e>", "<cs> it is too persuasive my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the point i am trying to make in the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that replywe were meeting each other across the table and splitting hairs <e> <s> i am glad that he has ultimately agreed to this modest but useful amendment which i believe will be well received throughout the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disappointed in the reply of the noble earl the minster <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said that he studied the amendment of the noble earl lord dudley very carefully before he understood it and he only hopes that he has understood it now <e> <s> he will appreciate that i had to take advice on the amendment that was put down <e> <s> i understand on the advice that i was given that the amendment appears to be innocuous though as the minister said this has made it a little firmer <e> <s> the purpose is to ensure that all references in the bill to transfers of property are to be deemed to include transfers of leasehold interests <e> <s> i think the amendment can be welcomed because it at least contemplates leases of airport land being part of a transfer scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the american experience of recruiting ethnic minorities seems to be rather better than ours <e> <s> are there any lessons to be learnt i am sure that the commissioner has looked at the problem from the american experience that could be of value here <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also thank the minister for the statement he made <e> <s> can i point out that the only positive decision in the statement concerned a college that is literally on my doorstep in glasgow <e> <s> refer to the mens physical education training at the jordanhill college of education <e> <s> is the noble viscount aware that this is a very beautiful college in a very lovely park and that there will be considerable worry about the disposal of any of the surplus buildings <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl give the house any information about the disposal of the engineering companies within the national bus company <e> <s> is he aware as i have been informed that about half of them have gone out of business or are in the process of going out of business <e> <s> how would that affect the validity of the safety guarantees that we were promised during the passage of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for interrupting the noble lord and i have been sitting listening with great interest <e> <s> instead of putting up a list of changes is it possible to state what the actual situation is <e> <s> drivers used to be able to know the old regulations fairly well and it must be very confusing for drivers now <e> <s> particularly when there are so many exemptions quite legitimate ones for farm vehicles lifeboat vehicles and airport vehicles <e> <s> is it possible to have a small booklet which gives an indication without it being binding in law of the rules of the road for drivers <e> <s> i believe that would help me as well <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the minister whether he will impress on the working party the urgency of this matter <e> <s> the committee may have noticed that i also have tabled an amendment which in view of what the noble lord has said i may possibly withdraw <e> <s> however in matters of marital breakdown the question of a place to live is extremely important and urgent for both ex-partners <e> <s> one of the difficulties of the matrimonial court as i understand it and possibly one of the reasons why we in scotland have taken steps to lead the way yet again is that the procedure takes a long time <e> <s> it may be a long time before the court reaches a decision on the disposal of the property and during that time additional tensions may be put upon the family even when it has broken up <e>", "<cs> will the minister tell us whether that will be before or after the election <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise for my late arrival which was caused by the fog <e> <s> i hasten to say that it was a london not a glasgow fog <e> <s> the minister will be aware that in my home city as i observed on several days and particularly on saturday there is quite incredible congestion <e> <s> i apologise for not being present to hear his answer but i am sure he will have reports from his divisional offices on the conditions in glasgow <e> <s> people are wondering whether they will be required to wait until the competition has got rid of those who are not going to succeed in the long run <e> <s> in that period must the citizens businesses and commercial enterprises of glasgow suffer this very serious inconvenience <e> <s> it is horrendous when it becomes impossible for other traffic to use two miles of main road in the middle of a city <e>", "<cs> my lords while it is too early to make final decisions about savings does the minister accept following the first question yesterday that there is a great deal of worry in some of the major cities <e> <s> i hope that the ministry will allow for traffic in accident losses when they are totalling up any gains that are made particularly in the big cities from the new transport act <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for the figures she gave <e> <s> i was given some figures by pharmacists <e> <s> their figures were somewhat different from those of the noble baroness but not materially so <e> <s> the existing figures are that approximately came from the government and from the pharmacy associations for the essential pharmacies allowances <e> <s> the noble baroness has said that the proposed new figures are still under discussion <e> <s> the proposals were that the pharmacists were willing to go as far as but apparently the government were willing to go to <e> <s> i do not know whether or not this is jumping the gun but these are the figures which i have been given <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble baroness realises that there is fairly strong feeling about the question of the negative resolution <e> <s> i must say that i picked up from the minister a slightly different message from that which apparently the noble lord lord harris of high cross picked up <e> <s> i did not think that we were going to get the actual draft regulations <e> <s> i thought the minister merely said that there would be consultation <e> <s> that is why i feel particularly strongly about the negative procedure <e> <s> in a <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord remember that during the passage of the airports bill considerable concern was expressed about the role of air traffic controllers and particularly the hours that they work <e> <s> after the events of the th of this month at the london airports it strikes one that the stress strain and tension on air traffic controllers is perhaps even greater than we had thought when we discussed the matter during the airports bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised that when he was speaking to this amendment the minister did not make reference to the fact that this house whatever happened at the other end made a firm decision on an amendment to the housing scotland bill on this subject <e> <s> many of the discussions we have had and many of the arguments put forward on this bill both at committee stage and tonight have been on the lines of the amendment carried by this house on the scottish bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord glenarthur for his remarks and i think we all accept the fact that we are still groping with a great many uncertainties <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord denning and the noble lord lord campbell pointed to some of the problems <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we should be grateful for at least being given the houses owned by a housing association although we would much rather have had the figure of dwellings included in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few words on this point <e> <s> i am very aware of the importance attached to it by the noble earls lord perth and lord selkirk and they have been very faithful in following their beliefs on the importance of charitable housing <e> <s> in re-reading the debate i was reminded of the fact that the noble earl lord perth made a special journey on his birthday to be present for this series of amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i did not give the impression that i was speaking about totally new build <e> <s> i was almost totally concerned i thought that i had made this clear with alterations and the adaptation of existing buildings <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to thank the minister for having gone some way towards meeting the genuine worries that my noble friend lord ross of marnock and i expressed during the earlier stages of the bill <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not really intended to speak to this amendment <e> <s> i rise merely to put the ministers mind at rest <e> <s> there is nothing secret waiting towards the end of the bill to change the points that have been made on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> when i suggested at a later date i meant a much later date when we have the <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i shall not raise an unpleasant note when everyone is so happy that the intentions of the bill are by and large good <e> <s> i wish to make some comments which i hope will take only a couple of minutes <e> <s> i apologise to the house and to the noble baroness for the fact that i was not able to participate in last weeks debates <e> <s> i was indisposed and had to go home early <e> <s> i hope that i have now more or less recovered <e>", "<cs> my lords i also congratulate the noble earl on his first appearance at the dispatch box and on the way he has so quickly fallen into the negative attitude of the replies that we normally receive <e> <s> surely the governments lukewarm attitude towards sanctions and apartheid as seen by many commonwealth countries affected support for the games <e> <s> he spoke about doomsday support for birmingham had the games been affected by some outside force <e> <s> surely what happened over the commonwealth games was not caused by an outside force <e> <s> it was a direct result of the governments <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope to speak very briefly in the debate on the gracious speech partly because so much has already been said here in another place and by skilled commentators in the newspapers on radio and on television <e>", "<cs> my lords may i deal first with the second point of the noble baroness <e> <s> the assumption was made by local authorities not just in glasgow but in edinburgh as well and they had to work on existing figures which would not vary a great deal <e> <s> they assumed that roughly the same <e>", "<cs> my lords that was a felicitous note on which to finish this part of the general debate <e> <s> this is basically a non-party political measure and i hope that when the bill reaches committee it will be treated in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the very fact that there has been an application to the traffic commissioner although it was unsuccessful in achieving the full effect that strathclyde regional transport wanted seems to have brought about a slightly more sensible attitude on the part of the scottish bus group <e>", "<cs> my lords anyone who did not know the procedure of your lordships house walking in today will have been surprised that a transport bill which is what this is actually has gone on as long and has gone down as many by-ways as it has <e> <s> but of course as everyone has said and particularly the right reverend prelate it would be unrealistic to discuss this bill only in relation to canary wharf because the whole question of the docklands light railway although it was originally seen as an aid to local regeneration is now clearly being seen as a developers railway and for that purpose primarily <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that that is perhaps a flaw in the wording but since the amendment is down and since practically everyone who has spoken today has expressed sorrow at the state of the north as it is called and has said that something should be done it would be churlish of us to reject the amendment when we are wishing the bill god-speed <e> <s> that would be wrong for anyone from the north and certainly for me <e> <s> i could not go back to glasgow and would not want to and say yes we gave canary wharf the go-ahead and though everyone in the house said that we have to do something about the north a simple amendment like this was rejected <e>", "<cs> no my lords i listened very carefully to my noble friend lord sefton partly because i knew that there would be this dilemma <e> <s> he said very early on that he would not oppose the third reading of the bill <e> <s> he merely wanted to take an opportunity which fortunately our democracy gives us the chance to do to raise once again the disparity between the north and the south <e> <s> in view of the way that the house has gone today i find it difficult to believe that anyone would not sympathise with this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the minister whether he can confirm that even if the amendment of the noble lord lord sefton were to be carried it would have no effect on the bill itself <e> <s> even if that amendment were carried the bill would still go through <e> <s> can the minister confirm that <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always very difficult to speak for a short period in a debate such as this <e> <s> i believe that we are already running over time so i shall try to allow your lordships to recover some of the time <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept my congratulations on the fact that the department has now designated scottish waters <e> <s> can he perhaps clear up a point and tell us the difference between notified and designated <e> <s> some of the terms are slightly puzzling <e> <s> is he aware of just how serious the problem has become <e> <s> since the ec has had the power to designate objectives we are now possibly seeing ourselves as others see us <e> <s> is he aware of how bad some of the beaches are in particular those of arran rothesay and largs and others in the clyde estuary <e> <s> they can be particularly bad at certain times of the year <e> <s> can the noble lord ask for a report on this <e> <s> will he also look at the fact that a relatively enclosed water such as the clyde requires perhaps different treatment from the north sea or some of the coastal areas of europe <e>", "<cs> i should like to support all those who have spoken in support of this amendment which i consider is extremely important <e> <s> i agree with the other non-lawyers about the complexity of the matter <e> <s> i thought that the noble baroness lady carnegy was boasting when she said that she understood two or three pages <e> <s> that is why i was laughing <e> <s> i understood the general impression of the bill as did no doubt the noble baroness and the noble lord lord sanderson <e>", "<cs> i should like to make a brief point on deterrence <e> <s> i can see the force of the argument of the noble lord lord sanderson that in the last resort one should be able to sell things to reclaim debt although it has been pointed out just how humiliating that can be <e> <s> but there is another way of looking at the matter especially in certain parts of scotland <e> <s> if there was no warrant sale in practically all cases credit would tend to dry up <e> <s> in other words part of the reason for people especially less scrupulous people lending money is that they know that at the end of the day they can have a warrant sale or threaten the shame of a warrant sale to recover the debt <e> <s> this could perhaps disastrously force people to go to moneylenders to get the money leading to another chain of deprivation <e> <s> there are other quite valid reasons for not having warrant sales <e> <s> it could get rid of a great deal of the debt that has accrued because unscrupulous people lend money on the basis of the warrant sale <e> <s> that is another way of looking at the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for explaining a somewhat complicated order and also to apologise for the fact that my noble friend lord john-mackie is unfortunately unable to be here tonight <e> <s> however he gave me a number of points to raise some of which have already been dealt with by the noble lord for instance the consultation with the national farmers union of scotland and the fact that compensation is being continued to be paid <e> <s> we have all learned some lessons from chernobyl <e> <s> the second point that my noble friend lord john-mackie wished to raise concerns the number of sheep which are still affected <e> <s> i heard the minister giving the figures which i shall read with interest <e> <s> i am very pleased to agree to the order going through <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe we should all thank the noble lord lord campbell of croy as i think everyone has done for giving us the opportunity to discuss once again the orange badge scheme and particularly the discussion paper of the department of transport <e> <s> it has obviously been a well-informed debate because well over half of those who have taken part have first-hand experience of this subject something which has been of great value <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister may recall that i moved the equivalent of amendment no <e> <s> at the committee stage <e> <s> i listened to his reply which he repeated in large substance a few minutes ago <e> <s> i feel much the same <e> <s> it is asking a great <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a great deal of sympathy with the amendment tabled <e>", "<cs> indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister take on board the importance of keeping together the gangs and teams who are involved in electrification work <e> <s> i ask this bearing in mind the potential export value involved <e> <s> if teams are broken up it is also difficult to get them back together again <e> <s> if it is possible will the government encourage british rail always to keep some electrification however small in progress <e> <s> this would be of great benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords i think everyone will agree that we have had a very long but also a very interesting debate tonight <e> <s> one of the things that we should all be very pleased about is that we have had no fewer than three maiden speeches <e> <s> the noble earl lord cowley made a most interesting point he did so succinctly when he spoke about the psychological barrier which is one of the things that affects the whole question of the channel tunnel <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope to speak very briefly today <e> <s> a great deal has been said and i think when we read the debate in its entirety we shall all realise that we have gained a great deal from it <e> <s> i am delighted we have been given this opportunity by my noble friend lord mccarthy to discuss the question of the unemployment figures <e> <s> i have noticed that later speakers have tended to go off the actual analysis of the figures and i certainly do not intend to go into that <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely correct of course <e> <s> it does not create any new jobs but i think it is important to look back if only to see where you have come from and where you have arrived <e> <s> the comparisions are of some value i believe <e> <s> certainly governments must find them of value <e> <s> what i cannot understand at the moment is whether we are speaking of per cent <e> <s> or per cent <e> <s> which i believe were the figures given earlier by the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i did say that i had listened to the ministers speech and had read it <e> <s> i mentioned my own reaction and i believe that the reaction of those outside was much the same <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for clearing that up because it is certainly something that is misunderstood <e> <s> perhaps his department will be able to reassure people by clearing up that point <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems strange that the minister thinks that no change will be made by substituting the words and he has taken advice on the matter <e> <s> is he not even aware that the arbitration panels determination would perhaps be inhibited if the word modified instead of altered was used <e> <s> i am slightly disappointed when the minister says that he thinks the amendment would make no difference whatever <e> <s> he was quite positive about that he still insists on keeping the bill as it is <e> <s> it is a small point but it could be quite an important point <e> <s> i know that a number of people involved feel very insecure <e> <s> it may be merely a sign of the times that there is change in the whole role of pilotage <e> <s> however there is a feeling of insecurity and therefore the amendment would be very helpful <e> <s> if the minister takes that view the best is to hope that in another place the matter will be taken up again when the government have more time to think about it <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we all accept that the minister in a case as serious as this has the same feelings as the rest of us and is anxious that there should be no additional hazard in the job of a pilot <e> <s> i shall withdraw the amendment and hope that he will be able to bring forward the regulations relatively quickly <e> <s> can he say whether that will be before the bill comes back to the house from another place <e>", "<cs> my lords accepting the total sincerity of the minister and his intentions i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we should thank the minister for his very succinct explanation of this bill <e> <s> he will appreciate of course that the bill in the other place was given a general <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble viscount <e> <s> he will realise that after seeing that figure i asked a number of people about it <e> <s> they were amazed but since the minister had not corrected it that is the only explanation that could possibly fit the facts <e> <s> thank you very much <e>", "<cs> my lords together with my noble friend lord ross of marnock i should like to say how glad i am that the noble lord lord underhill will be taking a prominent part in this debate <e> <s> we have had notable contributions from the welsh members as i hope we shall from the english members before the end of the debate <e> <s> undoubtedly this matter is being tested out in scotland and i am sure that people from outside scotland would regret it if they did not try to understand it at this point <e> <s> so i am very pleased that those peers are concerned about this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords it would not cancel it out for the individual student <e> <s> the poll tax does not apply in england <e> <s> for the individual student it will certainly not be cancelled out <e> <s> the student going to scotland will have this additional sum to pay unless there is access to the benefit system <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may reinforce the point made by my noble friend lady white <e> <s> i am grateful to her for having raised this on clause stand part <e> <s> as she said at second reading together with other noble lords i raised the question of research <e> <s> we are talking about rigs all over the world which will need to come down at some point <e> <s> we are talking about a cost of something like billion for our own offshore rig dismantling <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene briefly at this point <e> <s> i can understand that the noble lord would like to have a full two weeks before report stage <e> <s> on the other hand having listened to the minister it seems that he wishes to have the report stage immediately <e> <s> we have had an exhaustive debate on the two amendments <e> <s> however the minister surely accepts that the answers were full and extremely complicated <e> <s> i should like to have at least some time to look at them although perhaps not a full fortnight <e> <s> our debate has so far lasted minutes and we have had intricate discussions concerning international law and the law of the sea <e> <s> it is asking a great deal to move straight to report stage if that is what the minister suggests <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl for his reply <e> <s> i cannot say that i am happy with it and i do not really understand why he is not accepting this simple amendment <e> <s> i know that the noble lord <e> <s> lord renton is particularly correct in his reading of amendments but for clarification perhaps i may say that if he checks he will see that amendment no <e> <s> will answer the point he made <e> <s> i have suggested in that amendment that the register should be maintained <e>", "<cs> since my name is attached to amendment no <e> <s> i should like to thank the minister for what he said <e> <s> he has blown the whole clause wider of any scope than i thought of <e> <s> i thought it had to be something pertinent to the house <e> <s> he said quite correctly that shed is not mentioned but outhouse is which i thought would be the equivalent of a shed <e> <s> now that the minister is speaking in terms not just of homes but of student residences excluding the commercial part of them i believe that he has widened it greatly <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful that the minister has seen something in amendments to the bill with which he can show some sympathy <e> <s> with such bills there is always the worry that as the noble lord lord renton said when one strays from the principle into definitions the question of exclusion or inclusion arises which means more and more regulations issued by the government <e>", "<cs> i think the minister will agree that we are dealing with very complicated words and references <e> <s> i am grateful to him for the spirit in which he dealt with the amendments <e> <s> i agree that it is obvious when one sees these things <e> <s> the date of separation shall be from st april <e> <s> that was the concern <e> <s> there appears to be a misprint in the marshalled list and it is as well to have that corrected <e> <s> it rather stultifies things if it is one particular date <e>", "<cs> the noble lord will recall that this was an amendment i moved yesterday on the question of keeping the roll going <e> <s> i still feel that the noble lord lord buron has not been totally answered <e> <s> if someone decides to have his own supply or decides to give up his own supply how will that be recorded <e> <s> will people be able to see that someone pays less because he has his own supply <e> <s> will it be worth your while finding a supply in your own grounds <e> <s> alternatively someone may find that it is better just to take the public supply after many years <e> <s> the noble lord lord burton no doubt has had his own supply for some period <e>", "<cs> the minister will realise that this is a slightly disappointing reply giving the secretary of state more power than i think he should have in a local situation <e> <s> however i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i see the point of the argument <e> <s> the point i make may be slightly farfetched but earlier in the bill there is a requirement that the treasury must be consulted <e> <s> the noble lord lord renton said that we know that it is consulted but the minister insisted that the fact that it must be consulted be on the face of the bill <e> <s> we are asking again that cosla should be consulted but in a much less onerous way than with the previous agreement made with the treasury <e> <s> the minister agrees that cosla will be consulted <e> <s> i hoped that he would go so far as to say that it shall be <e> <s> however in view of the explanation that he has given and the fact that the matter has been drawn to his attention i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i may have misunderstood but i assumed that the secretary of state would have had consultations with the local authority although i accept that the main point in determining the non-domestic rate will be the retail price index which we have recently discussed <e> <s> i thought that there would be sufficent room for manoeuvre and that even after consultation with cosla there would still be plenty of room to fix the grant aid distribution <e> <s> however i shall look carefully at what the minister has said and at present i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we should first of all congratulate the noble lord lord hardinge of penshurst on raising the question of roads in east sussex <e> <s> i should also like to thank the minister for sending me a map showing the existing and proposed road system in the area <e> <s> i must pay tribute <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that they have something in common <e> <s> we were a little lucky in that off the north-east coast of scotland oil was discovered and there was a sudden readjustment of priorities to accommodate it <e> <s> in east kent there is a great readjustment to accommodate the channel tunnel which will possibly burn itself out <e> <s> i wish the noble lord well in his campaign for road improvements in the area <e> <s> as i said i do not want to be too dampening <e> <s> but i have a little experience of fighting for roads in different parts of the country and in listening to people who are fighting for roads <e>", "<cs> i think we should all be grateful to the noble earl lord perth for raising this question and also for the grouping we have <e> <s> it gives us an opportunity to discuss the whole problem of students who are likely to be affected by the bill and the many problems they may have <e> <s> at present overseas students in scottish universities pay full course fees per term <e> <s> as has been said on top of that they will now be required to pay their personal community charge <e> <s> that must surely deter a certain number of students from coming to scotland <e> <s> there is a very long tradition of overseas students coming to scottish universities in particular to study medicine divinity engineering and law <e> <s> although i do not have the figures at my fingertips i should imagine that proportionally more overseas students have come to scotland over the decades than have gone to any other country <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the minister has ever been in an area like the byres road area of glasgow where almost every sunday he would see groups of students changing digs <e> <s> they do not like the digs that they are in and they move to other ones they move around <e> <s> i do not know how they can be traced <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very brief <e> <s> i should also like to add my condolences to the noble lord lord kennet in his illness and hope that he will be back with us fairly soon <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the minister will agree that it is still early to make final decisions on the efficiency or otherwise of the bill <e> <s> the minister must also be aware hat a great deal of shaking down has still to be done <e> <s> he suggested that the situation concerning strathclyde for instance had now settled down <e> <s> however this mornings <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the work for local authorities as regards tendering for new services is becoming very time-consuming and expensive <e> <s> that is where at least part of the million of which he spoke so happily is going <e>", "<cs> that is the solution we should like <e> <s> i tried to say how impossible it is to deal with this complicated matter through opposition amendments <e> <s> it really is a job for the <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for the efforts that he has made in coming towards the object of these amendments <e> <s> there probably will be difficulty in finding a typical occupancy rate <e> <s> i am grateful for the support of the noble lord lord burton <e> <s> i do not think that there is any great desire on the part of the women to stay in some of the refuges for very long <e> <s> the real problem is that sometimes there are no local authority houses for them <e> <s> if housing cannot be provided for them it is difficult to get them to move on <e>", "<cs> this was a probing amendment <e> <s> i shall read carefully what the minister has said but in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it may be for the convenience of the committee if i speak to amendment no <e> <s> a which is in the same batch so that the minister can reply at the same time <e> <s> its purpose is to probe the type of information which will not be made available to the community charges registration officer even allowing for the fact that it may be the same person in another hat who will be collecting the information <e> <s> i am asking that question because i know that strathclyde regional council and one or two others make a survey <e> <s> they call it the voluntary population survey <e> <s> it is of great help to them <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister takes this on board <e> <s> there is opinion throughout the committee of the need to find a better definition for responsible person <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this is a a very difficult area <e> <s> i believe it is all tied up with the definition of responsible person <e> <s> i shall read the ministers reply and in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i believe that this amendment comes under clause and not clause as shown on the marshalled list <e> <s> but in view of that explanation from the minister i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not being ingenious in trying to raise the subject about which i wish to speak at this late time <e> <s> the minister dealt with amendment no <e> <s> and pointed out some of the difficulties but i am sure that he realises that the whole matter is full of difficulties <e> <s> mention has been made of the problem of churches manses and presbyteries which sometimes have a number of people living in them <e> <s> in the case of one or two catholic presbyteries there may be seven eight or priests <e> <s> most of them have no income <e> <s> i understand that under the present system rate relief is given to such premises <e>", "<cs> i was about to say that there are one or two other amendments that members will find very close to this group <e> <s> it may save time if they are discussed together and moved when we reach them <e>", "<cs> the minister having said what he has about amendment no <e> <s> i shall be quite happy to withdraw it but i shall certainly wish to move amendment no <e> <s> a formally <e>", "<cs> i must thank the minister for having tabled this new clause <e> <s> i want to make only one point and it may be of help to him <e> <s> i have been informed that section <e>", "<cs> will the minister clear up just one point <e> <s> is it correct that the new clause is only applicable from <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disappointed in the minister <e> <s> i had the feeling that his heart was not behind his argument <e> <s> although i may be wrong i had that very strong feeling <e> <s> of course cosla will be able to achieve this <e> <s> local government officials are much maligned but i have found them to be very efficient and hard working people <e> <s> they will do <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the minister for the way he replied to the amendment <e> <s> like my noble friend lord ross of marnock i am disappointed that he was not able to promise rather better service from the draftsman on what will be extremely complicated amendments <e> <s> as my noble friend lord ross of marnock said unless we receive the regulations very soon we shall never see them and we shall have little scope to do anything about them <e> <s> we wait in the hope that the minister may be able to give us sight of at least some draft regulations before very long <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am disappointed that the minister has replied as he has <e> <s> i should just like to emphasise again the importance of the statutory powers if a local authority is to have a register <e> <s> but i do not see why it should be a valuation register the minister called it a valuation register as it could be a register of properties in the area <e> <s> but having statutory powers would be one way of being able to guarantee finding out exactly where properties are and who is occupying them <e> <s> but i realise that i have probably gone as far as i can on this point and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords since this amendment no <e> <s> is being taken with the amendment in my name amendment no <e> <s> perhaps i should say a brief word on the differences <e> <s> when the noble lord lord campbell of croy spoke about the importance of this amendment to the tourist industry i became slightly more confused because he was talking about static caravans used as the main or sole home of a resident whereas i should have thought that the tourist industry was much more concerned with mobile caravans <e>", "<cs> my lords i see the point now <e> <s> this reinforces what i said on an earlier amendment which to some extent was helped by the ministers letter i quoted earlier <e> <s> he said that he would be able as soon as the bill was enacted to put down the regulations <e> <s> by covering these points and the distinctions between the two types of caravan sites my amendment which is much the same as the one i moved at committee stage was merely to try to have the definition put more clearly into the bill <e> <s> with the assurance the minister gave me and the courtesy he showed by sending me the letter which i dealt with more fully on an earlier amendment i shall be happy not to move my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his explanation <e> <s> without it i do not know how anyone would he able to make a reasonable stab at what the paragraph means <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> has been grouped with amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> perhaps i may say a few words in support of the general tenor of the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the minister was trying hard to put the case against the amendments but i still feel that they are much more likely to get rid of problems than will the bill as at present worded <e> <s> i shall deal with the poll tax <e> <s> it was not invented by us <e> <s> in the governments green paper of a charge similar to a community charge was discussed <e> <s> they called it a poll tax <e> <s> the government discarded it <e> <s> it was not our idea <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that explanation <e> <s> i am amazed at his great confidence <e> <s> since in most of the other areas of the bill the minister has power to make arrangements by regulation i thought he may have put in a reserve power on this particular subject <e> <s> but he is confident that this is unnecessary <e> <s> i shall watch the situation with great care <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot say that i am overwhelmed but i take at least some comfort from what the minister said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot say i am grateful for the efforts the minister has made in trying to explain the amendment that he moved and i am afraid that i shall need to give this considerable thought and have it examined very carefully <e> <s> i am concerned that because he has moved amendment no <e> <s> the part that amendment no <e> <s> a changes or amends that means that this simple amendment i thought i had which dealt with houses of refuge is not able to be applied <e> <s> therefore unless the minister can assure me that the substance of amendment no <e> <s> a will in some way be accepted by the government i shall not oppose it but i wish to look at amendment no <e> <s> very carefully and will try to find an amendment for third reading that will bring in the meaning and reach the same purpose as amendment no <e> <s> a which seeks to include homes of refuge in the collective community charge <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his explanation and particularly for the flexibility shown on the other two amendments <e> <s> on amendment no <e> <s> a on the frequency and possible frequency of assessing the collective community charge multiplier i accept that perhaps for the first time three months is reasonable <e> <s> thereafter the local people in the assessors office will soon get to know the managers they are dealing with and will be able to make some assessment of their rectitude <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> with that reassurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has made a full explanation <e> <s> i shall read it with care <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that the amendment was reasonably innocuous <e> <s> as the minister has said the secretary of state would find it difficult to make a summary that was not faithful to that submitted by the council <e> <s> i also suggested that there would be no harm in having a summary as long as the full representation was available to members of parliament <e> <s> i do not think it is enough to say that councils and local authorities have ways of letting members of parliament know how they feel about matters <e> <s> of course they do and it is quite right that they should <e> <s> however when some matter comes up particularly with the heavy load of business in parliament i believe that there would be no harm in having the full text available to members of parliament <e> <s> however this matter has been raised before and we have got no further with it <e> <s> i therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a concession which i am only too pleased to accept at this stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his explanation <e> <s> one wonders how as regards earlier legislation the minister would have defended his position if someone had said closely was tying the minister down too much <e> <s> i feel that he would have been just as zealous in defending the inclusion of the word closely as he is now in saying that it is unnecessary and misleading <e> <s> however in view of his explanation i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the difficulty about the ministers explanation is that the government and the secretary of state have managed very well without needing to take account of any surplus funds available to the local authority and it is disappointing that they have now suddenly decided that they must have access to these surpluses <e> <s> on reflection the government will find that there are a number of local authorities who are not very happy and they may not necessarily be local authorities of the persuasion of this side of the house <e> <s> however having heard the explanation and disappointed though i may be i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords that appears to be a belt and braces approach <e> <s> i cannot remember such a situation ever existing <e> <s> i do not think it even applied to orkney and shetland and the enormous bonanza there <e> <s> it is an amusing explanation and one can only hope that it will one day be required in a local authority in scotland <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords on reflection and in view of the ministers reply and the fact that there undoubtedly will be unfairness between scotland and england until a similar bill is fully implemented in england and wales i think we should get the opinion of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his explanation and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies i wonder whether he can help me on the question of fees <e> <s> i do not know whether they are large or small or <e>", "<cs> can the minister help over the question of whether there will be any reimbursement <e> <s> a fee of for a voluntary organisation in lanark where there is a number of such organisations would be difficult for them to raise <e> <s> i doubt whether they would even raise the one years fee in a flag day in lanark <e> <s> how else will they be compensated <e> <s> will they be compensated for that very large initial fee <e> <s> i can understand that later on is manageable but is a very large sum for a relatively small voluntary organisation to meet <e> <s> perhaps the minister would take time and write to me before the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been a great deal of difficulty <e> <s> the printers and the clerks of the house have worked hard trying to keep up with the rapidity with which the bill has been pushed through the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister suggested that my amendment would widen the definition too much and the noble lord lord renton believed it would narrow it unless i have the minuses and pluses the wrong way round <e> <s> however i feel that the answer given was not as satisfactory as it could have been particularly when we all want to try to make this part of the bill workable understandable and as helpful as possible to people who are in a very difficult situation <e> <s> the minister may wish to speak again before i finish my remarks completely <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that long explanation which i think will be well worth reading <e> <s> as the debate proceeded it appeared that the ambiguity became more obvious <e> <s> however having heard the ministers explanation and in the belief that the bill and the sub-paragraphs as they stand to not circumscribe his powers to define in the way he later developed i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that when my noble friend lord morton of shuna reads <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord campbell of alloway suggested that in some way i had wanted this amendment to be a probing one yet on the other hand i wanted to have it accepted <e> <s> from the words of the noble baroness lady carnegy of lour there was obviously a great deal of doubt as to what the actual intentions of the government were and therefore an explanation was required <e> <s> if the explanation was not satisfactory the purpose of the amendment was to try and safeguard the local authority at the end of the day so that it would not be in a worse position than it is now <e>", "<cs> my lords now that we are at the end of the very long road we have travelled since second reading this is an appropriate time to say a few words to the minister and to the house generally <e> <s> although i knew the minister would he armed with statistics i had not realised that we had debated for fully hours <e> <s> also it did not sound to <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank my noble friend for supporting me in this amendment <e> <s> i can see the point being made by the minister that there are safeguards included in the agreement <e> <s> but as my noble friend lord mulley has suggested we do not know exactly what the agreement is <e> <s> i am tempted to divide the committee <e> <s> the fact made clear by the minister in another place that there should be a long-stop was all that we were asking for <e> <s> we feel that there should be something <e>", "<cs> with that promise i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i imagine that the committee will be pleased with the statement that the minister made so far as it went but there was something slightly complacent when he said that what has been done was done with no pressure from parliament <e> <s> i should have thought it was the elementary job of the dti with a project as big as this tunnel to jump in in a situation like this <e> <s> what is most worrying is that all of the schemes set up are advisory <e> <s> there is no powerful group such as there is in the north sea which almost had a minister of its own a very energetic minister mr alick buchanan-smith who alas has left the government <e> <s> he was very involved in bashing heads together and getting things done <e> <s> but i agree that in some ways that was in a different category from this and that the north sea was right on the fringe of technology <e>", "<cs> as my name is attached to amendment no <e> <s> which is being taken with this i should like to endorse everything that the noble lords lord northbourne and lord tordoff have said <e> <s> the wording of amendment no <e> <s> i find is much more explicit and all embracing than my own amendment <e> <s> i shall be happy not to move my amendment in favour of his amendment <e>", "<cs> a small point arises on the ministers last sentence <e> <s> i understand that this provision does not affect the future power of a minister to acquire land without the authority of parliament it affects only the area of land near the tunnel <e> <s> will the minister confirm that it does not give <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord tordoff suggested that one of the important issues for areas to the north and west of london is that there should be on-train facilities <e> <s> i go further and say that one of the strong selling points for the north was that there would be on-train facilities and that they would rush through <e>", "<cs> i shall speak very briefly on this amendment <e> <s> it is interesting that we have spent more time on it than we did discussing the safety aspects earlier <e> <s> i accept the principle of the amendment <e> <s> i think that the argument put forward by the noble lord lord renton who is now sitting as deputy chairman of the committee about sheer <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the minister for clarification <e> <s> although st december is the point at which the plan under this section must be produced does it all have to be done at once <e> <s> am i correct in my impression that the plans will be evolved gradually although the date for the final of the first stage before the continual review is st december <e> <s> it would have some effect if we could hope that there would be interim plans before the final plan is passed <e>", "<cs> would be <e>", "<cs> the minister suggested that this would be the finish of the argument about waterloo <e> <s> i suspect that it will not be and that in a few years time there may be a revision from british rail <e> <s> it has happened before when it has come to different conclusions <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord mulley for expanding on what i said <e> <s> i thought that the minister would have accepted those remarks <e> <s> i was slightly peeved that he took exception to what i said as if i did not trust british rail <e> <s> it is not that i do not trust british rail <e> <s> about nine years ago when the transport select committee of another place dealt with this question there was a big debate as to whether it was to be a mousehole or a proper tunnel carrying freight as well as passenger trains <e> <s> it was the treasury which insisted that british rail could not commit itself because of its public service obligation to guarantee a throughput for whoever was running the tunnel <e>", "<cs> i shall read with great care what the minister has said <e> <s> we shall keep it beside us during the publication of the prospectus <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> i am sure he sees the dilemma that we find <e> <s> there could be an argument that the cost would be the aspect that would defeat the assessment on the customs and immigration on the through service <e> <s> it would be a pity if such a thing happened and it would do great harm to the acceptability of the tunnel in the country as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great pleasure to be given the opportunity to speak following so many impressive and knowledgeable speeches <e> <s> there are three things to be done <e> <s> first i thank the noble lord lord nelson of stafford who gave us the opportunity to discuss the report of his committee outside the normal framework of the future of transport <e> <s> the noble lord ranged much wider than the noble lord lord tordoff and the transport buffs in this place <e> <s> it is a much wider report than normal and it has brought in a broader group of people who are particularly interested in transport <e> <s> therefore it has enriched the general discussion <e> <s> we are very grateful to the noble lord lord nelson of stafford for the opportunity to discuss this very valuable report <e> <s> i did not serve on the committee and i must confess that i have not read the entire report though i have been through a fair amount of it <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a fascinating debate <e> <s> it deals with a part of the country with which i am not familiar <e> <s> however i listened to much of the second reading debate and i have listened to this debate <e> <s> i read with great care the second reading debate and the report of the select committee <e> <s> i now believe that i have a certain affinity with the area although i have a long way to go to be anything like as familiar with it as almost everyone who has spoken in the debate so far <e>", "<cs> my lords we should be grateful that the minister agreed in principle with what was suggested in the amendment <e> <s> however i think that at that point he must have gained a very clear impression that the agreement of the house and of everybody who has spoken would end <e> <s> the minister gave a very disappointing reply <e> <s> the tunnel is something that is entirely new <e> <s> it is a very big project <e> <s> we have been told all through the series of debates and in the committee stages in this place and in another place that the tunnel is a great new venture <e> <s> yet the minister and the department seem content to have the same machinery for discussing this big new venture as we would have in the case of a single customer in a certain part of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords the words of the noble lord lord tordoff are apposite here that in many ways we are treading delicate ground no pun is intended there <e> <s> but the amendment merely asks that the value of that interest which is attributable to public works should have additional compensation <e> <s> we and our colleagues in another place believe as was stated at committee stage there that a fairly important principle is involved <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister will clear up the question that the noble earl lord kinnoull raised that is that the increased value is already allowed for in the land compensation act or whether there was a mechanism of assessing the value properly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for having brought this point to my notice <e> <s> the minister quoted clause <e> <s> i know that people in scotland are very law-abiding and i am sure there is a simple explanation for my query <e> <s> clause states <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the minister and all those who took part in the debate which was most enlightening <e> <s> the ministers contribution because the debate was so well-disciplined in terms of time we shall be able to study because it was possible for him to include a great deal more than he would have done had he been limited to minutes <e> <s> i look forward to reading what he said with greater care than i was able to listen to it <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the motion <e>", "<cs> my lords i note that the minister said this was neither necessary nor appropriate <e> <s> as to its inappropriateness i wonder whether he would look at it again <e> <s> that is one of the points on which the meaning of the amendment hinges <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that no-one believes that none of the lights is required but that there is a general feeling that there are too many lights and that the system is far too expensive <e> <s> i am pleased to hear that he intends thoroughly to review the matter <e> <s> can he give us any idea when he will be able to publish some material on this subject <e> <s> surely he is aware that in the past few weeks the question of lights has been raised by members from all parts of the house and that is is causing some concern to shipping interests <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the minister for his explanation of the draft order <e> <s> perhaps i may also take this opportunity of thanking him for his thoughtfulness in providing a written explanation of what on the face of it is an order which is very difficult to comprehend <e> <s> with his explanation and with the benefit of having had time to study the written letter that he was kind enough to send my noble friend lord underhill and myself it has made the order much more intelligible <e> <s> we are very happy that the minister has brought it before the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the debate makes us all anxious to move into committee after the many important points that have been raised <e> <s> it is fortunate that the committee stage will be considered on the floor of the house and not as in an earlier experience in a committee room <e> <s> with the many points that have been raised the committee stage should be most interesting and enlightening <e>", "<cs> my lords while i accept that the sleepers according to those who use them a great deal tend to be underused for large parts of the week although they are very busy at certain times in particular at weekends i should like to ask the minister whether he has any figures to show the intensity of the utilisation of sleepers <e> <s> is there any likelihood of his advising british rail to look at the possibility of repricing and perhaps allowing discount fares as the airlines do for the slack periods of the week <e>", "<cs> i should also like to support the amendment <e> <s> knowing the great experience of the noble lord lord gray he is more aware than any of us of the feeling that we are always being left behind by unequal competition <e> <s> he made the telling point that <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for the very apposite points that my noble friend lord mulley raised about the power of a minister not being totally delineated in an act but that he should have a general power to look at the national interest <e> <s> we hope that the minister will always do that <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> i am glad that he mentioned accountability <e> <s> how the money would be lent and how it would he accounted for was causing us some concern <e> <s> the minister rightly said that the money would be payable to the company <e> <s> there will be a transfer from the company to the officers and crew who are being returned <e> <s> there are a few points in his answer that need looking into but in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it was always going to prove difficult to achieve an all-embracing amendment when we have to consider ireland the <e>", "<cs> i take the point that the noble lord lord boyd-carptenter has made <e> <s> i have always found it difficult to have prayers accepted <e> <s> they are sometimes difficult particularly in the other place when ones own whips are twisting ones arm at the same time <e> <s> i therefore believe that the affirmative resolution is more appropriate <e> <s> however this is not the time to push the matter to a division <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i can see the flaw in the amendment <e> <s> instead of saying that i shall consider it what i should be doing perhaps is to turn my mind to those who advised me on the point <e> <s> i have no alternative but to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord mottistone said this group of amendments is being taken together <e> <s> he has gone more fully into the matter than he did in the series of amendments nos <e> <s> to in the name of the noble lord lord underhill and myself <e> <s> we believe that we can support the amendment of the noble lord lord mottistone in preference to that of the noble lord lord brabazon of tara <e>", "<cs> we have not had the advantage of the words of the minister <e> <s> we did not get a copy of the letter as it was not our amendment <e> <s> in a highly specialised area such as the trial of a captain or a master of a ship who is going before an ordinary court there should certainly be a <e>", "<cs> i am very pleased that the noble lord lord mottistone has pointed that matter out <e> <s> the wording does suggest that an independent investigator who is representative of the person involved in an accident is appointed <e> <s> however it is not uncommon that a friend should look after the interests of a particular group of people <e> <s> that is not to say that we do not trust the new body that is going to be set up by the department <e> <s> but we are merely saying that certain voices are louder than others <e> <s> i would hope that the sailors and the officers who are involved would be able to put their case to the inspector through someone who is fully trained in putting such cases <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for those comments <e> <s> i intend to withdraw the amendment but can he give me some indication that numast and the nus whose members after all are most at risk will be consulted during the drafting of the regulations <e> <s> i am sure that that is normal practice within the department but i hope that the minister can give me that assurance <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> i believe that the point which was made about fish was out of place in the context of the discussion <e> <s> that point may be quite important and i hope the minister will consider it <e> <s> however it was not the point i was making <e> <s> i moved the amendment in the belief that there could be a growth of offshore businesses avoiding our ports and merely using the shelter in order to start a new type of industry which would do the british merchant fleet no good <e>", "<cs> it is not because of the suggestion of the gin and tonic that i am rising to give general support to the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> it has been our consistent view since we were discussing the pilotage bill that by and large these should be national charges <e> <s> i agree that the cost of travel to international conferences should be a national charge and not one placed on the industry <e> <s> therefore subject to what the minister may have to say i give the support of our side of the committee to the noble lord lord mottistone <e>", "<cs> the minister will realise that his reply is disappointing <e> <s> i thought that we were moving with the times in allowing the payment to be geared up through modern computers <e> <s> i find it difficult to believe that with the small number of seamen employed in ships nowadays it is so difficult to keep track of particulars of seamen in north-west europe <e> <s> the banks assure me that they can deliver cash to nominated banks in almost any part of europe by telegraph in seconds <e> <s> therefore while i understand the problem of the days which was required at one time not being as important as <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the ministers clarification <e> <s> he has again given me a great deal to look at <e> <s> by and large i agree with him but i should like to look at what he said in <e>", "<cs> my lords everyone would want to congratulate the british steel corporation on its quite remarkable performance over the past few years <e> <s> however is the noble lord aware that there will be little satisfaction or reassurance felt in scotland when the fine print of the statement has been examined <e> <s> under examination the apparent seven-year guarantee becomes subject to commercial requirements and market conditions <e> <s> how does this differ from the statements made in and when a period of three years was given <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will be aware that i am disappointed <e> <s> in putting the case again i thought that the minister would see some merit in it <e> <s> i intend to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> however i still believe that the political discretion or as the minister described it political controversy might be required at certain times in the future <e> <s> he said that the future was not foreseeable <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord who has just asked the minister another question has raised the whole matter again <e> <s> i should have thought that there would be a sufficiency of log books to he able to assure the master that everything had been tested and stamped up <e> <s> the minister introduces a slightly wider aspect when he says that the master would know if the ship had been well maintained <e> <s> unless it is his own crew in many cases the master will not be happy about taking the ship over and assuming that everything is all right <e> <s> he would give no guarantee unless his own engineers had been responsible for maintenance <e>", "<cs> my lords the case put by the noble lord lord mottistone is a strong one <e> <s> we have added our names to the amendment <e> <s> on a couple of occasions the minister has said that the deletion of the subsection would not materially affect the bill <e> <s> when he sees that there is fairly strong feeling among those who are concerned about the bill that the provision should be deleted i hope that he will give it serious consideration <e> <s> it is always possible to have / vision after something has happened and realise that something should have been done <e> <s> this provision plays with an important part of the criminal law <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will be aware that it has come as quite a surprise that he has accepted this amendment after what we were led to believe at committee stage <e> <s> i should like to know what consultations he had with the seamens union on this matter <e> <s> i should also like to know about the paving and consequential amendments that he is likely to table <e> <s> we consider that it is extremely serious at this very late hour to accept such an important amendment and we certainly reserve the right to consider the matter when we come to third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think there is anyone in the house particularly anyone with a scottish background who would wish to delay this bill unduly <e> <s> although it is a small bill it is an important one <e> <s> as the minister has pointed out the scottish development agency is an important part of scottish development <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the trouble which the minister has taken to answer what i thought was a pertinent question which i put at report stage of the bill <e> <s> i believe that his answer will help in the consideration to be given to the bill in another place <e> <s> however realising that i have already raised the matter for the third time i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am only too pleased to thank my noble friend lord morton of shuna for having initiated the debate today <e> <s> it is some indication of the general interest in the subject that there were so many speakers in the debate <e> <s> obviously it is impossible to deal with all the issues from this side of the house but the general points will be considered or have been dealt with in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that to my knowledge there were no discussions or consultations with the board of newbattle college before the decision was made to withdraw the grant <e> <s> i believe that the letter was received on th december <e> <s> will the noble earl accept that although there are many new ways of entering higher education there is still a great need to ensure that people whose circumstances are not conducive to study are able to attend the residential course <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl said that there would be discussions between officials of the department and the board of the college <e> <s> can we assume that there may be a certain open-mindedness on the part of the government in respect of this matter <e> <s> will the noble earl ask officials to pay particular attention to the fact that this beautiful house which which i am fairly familiar was given by the lothian family <e> <s> although the upkeep is considerable we should not like to lose the house which is part of our scottish heritage <e> <s> therefore it is inevitable that part of the costs of newbattle abbey must be the upkeep of the establishment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very conscious of the fact that speaking on salmon in your lordships house means meeting and listening to very erudite and experienced people <e> <s> i took part in the debates on the act and i have done some re-reading of it <e> <s> i have not gone through the entire act or the proceedings in the house but i have paid a fair amount of attention to it <e> <s> it is interesting to note the way in which the arguments are arising again in this debate <e>", "<cs> i too am grateful for the ministers suggestion that he discuss the matter with the members of the committee <e> <s> i hope he will take to the secretary of state for scotland before he comes to discuss it the firm opinion that came from all sides of the committee and quite powerfully that there is something special about the islands and not just in sentimental terms but in factual terms <e> <s> the idea of trying to impose a bill upon as the noble earl lord balfour suggested london the shetlands and stornoway at the same time does not seem to balance at all <e>", "<cs> my noble friend interrupted me most profitably while i was trying to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i have a feeling that that reply does not really satisfy the noble baroness <e> <s> the whole history is so different <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that explanation which makes it easier to understand what is inevitably a complicated order <e> <s> we all laugh or make fun of bureaucracy but this is an example of exactly the sort of situation in which the value of bureaucracy is apparent <e> <s> when the noble lord described the details of the colour changes and all the rest of it it showed how important it is to have a system which we laughingly call bureaucracy <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that i missed the beginning of the debate on this amendment <e> <s> the committee will be aware that the house was late in finishing the last item <e> <s> i was pleased to hear the noble earls definition of secretary of state <e> <s> the amendment is inspired by the law society of scotland <e> <s> i agree with its opinion that it was all very well when or years ago the job of secretary of state was not onerous and one secretary of state could cover all the tasks <e> <s> i do not expect the government to concede this tonight but the point has been reached when the issue should be looked at again in a constitutional manner <e> <s> there is no longer one secretary of state <e> <s> people become confused when they realise that the secretary of state is in essence one person with a multiplicity of heads <e> <s> i hope that the minister will reconsider this matter and that it may be included in a separate bill at some future date <e> <s> the idea of there being only one secretary of state is becoming antiquated <e> <s> however i have heard the noble earls explanation and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg to move the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we all give due thanks to the noble earl lord perth for raising this subject <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mackie of benshie has just said it gave us the opportunity to speak as we wished <e> <s> listening to the debate it was interesting how it came down to one or two subjects <e> <s> perhaps i should confess that i was not sure what the noble earl would like me to discuss when i read the order paper and i had a word with him <e> <s> i knew that he was concerned about certain things but i felt that the debate may have gone rather wider <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> i am sure he will be aware from his reading of the scottish press just how important the statement is to scotland and particularly to scottish education <e> <s> there is a strong feeling right across the press that the government are changing the rules in the middle of consultation <e> <s> the direct interference it can only be described as that by the prime minister in a specific local matter is surely to be deplored <e>", "<cs> my lords it is rather important to consider what the noble baroness lady carnegy said when she talked about a row in the labour group <e> <s> there was no row <e> <s> it was just a normal problem that one has in any group when one is making selections about closing this or that school <e> <s> all of us who have been in a representative capacity particularly in the other place know that as soon as a school is going to close the people naturally do not like the change <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> i can understand the point he made about the convention of scottish local authorities being the only existing body and that there may be others in the future <e> <s> i am sure that that position can easily be overcome by providing for such other bodies as the secretary of state may wish to consult <e> <s> however the minister made a meaty reply and there are a number of issues that i shall wish to digest <e> <s> i shall take the matter away and in the meantime beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very glad to have heard the ministers reply <e> <s> if the commission and the local authority takes his point of view reasonable should he the watchword of both sides when they are dealing with the matter <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i gain the impression from what the minister said that he is slowly beginning to realise that there is not a great deal of logic in including some of the islands because he is giving so many assurances that there will be examination and consultations with the islands before anything is done <e> <s> he said that the islands already use private contractors and that that makes one sure that there is no ideological objection in the islands to using such contractors <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the noble lord was in the chamber when i moved the amendment but i was most economical with time <e> <s> i moved it in about two minutes so that we could deal with the matter <e> <s> we had a discussion with the minister which was very satisfactory <e> <s> the noble lord lord campbell of croy and i wanted to get on the record what the minister said <e> <s> i think that is fair enough <e> <s> now that it is on the record i am entitled in view of what i said to ask the minister to expand a little more on what he will consider when he makes his regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may briefly expand upon that point <e> <s> the ministers reply was substantially what he had previously told us <e> <s> however if he had not been such an honourable member of this place his reply today could have been quite different <e> <s> surely i should then be entitled as i think i am on a couple of points to emphasise the importance of the amendment <e> <s> one of the important points i made was that the islands already use private contractors <e> <s> therefore they have no ideological objection to competitive tendering <e> <s> indeed the minister made a point of saying that such authorities sent much of their work out for tender <e> <s> i thought that that reflected on his earlier insistence that there must be tendering for all services unless they fall into one of the many categories mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that statement <e> <s> it is perhaps the best statement we have had to date about the way in which the government intend to operate the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure many people will be surprised that the minister is so confident that there will be a great deal more money raised by the poll tax <e> <s> he must be aware of the number of people who have refused to register on the electoral roll because they are afraid of being included for the poll tax <e>", "<cs> my lords new money <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will appreciate that his reply is rather disappointing <e> <s> first of all i should like to welcome to the house my noble friend lord stoddart who has been liberated from the front bench <e> <s> we are not happy about the reasons for that but we know that on the back benches he will be extremely active and pertinent and even show the aggression that we expect and enjoy from him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for having given us the opportunity to discuss the matter <e> <s> i do not intend to speak for very long i believe that he covered the main points <e> <s> i should also like to dissociate myself totally <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the minister for going through the bill as <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend lord underhill for initiating the debate and all those taking part in it <e> <s> we all bring our own experiences to these debates <e> <s> since most of us tend to disperse throughout the country at the weekend i believe that we can collectively give a good overall impression of the state of public transport as we find in our own areas <e> <s> by the very nature of being in this house we also have a knowledge of what is happening in london transport <e>", "<cs> the committee will be aware that it has been decided that it would be convenient to discuss amendments nos <e> <s> and together <e> <s> my name and that of my noble friend lord morton of shuna are on the amendments <e> <s> i should like to add to what the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe stressed towards the end of his remarks about peoples problems <e> <s> we are not just talking about people in poor housing we are talking about families which have no homes <e> <s> many of them live in the notorious bed and breakfast accommodation and that is no way to bring up a family <e> <s> it sows the seeds of later problems for society <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say one or two words about amendment no <e> <s> which has been spoken to with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i shall read with great care what the minister has just said <e> <s> he seemed to say that the amendment was superfluous because the responsibilities of the local authority under the housing scotland act clause provided that shha had a duty to assist local authorities with regard to homeless persons and that that duty would be transferred to scottish homes <e> <s> once the ministers speech is printed in <e>", "<cs> i think that this is a very important amendment although my own name is not on it <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister in his reply could give us an indication that paragraph g <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for the spirit of his reply <e> <s> unfortunately that spirit is difficult to put into a code in perhaps or years time <e> <s> one of the problems which was raised rather sharply i think by the noble earl lord balfour is that at certain critical periods one could get within a local authority strong conveners of housing for instance who would push ahead without having the machinery in the council to uphold the operations <e> <s> a convenor would be concerned with figures of housing and because he was concerned with increasing his housing statistics schools shopping and community centres might in the rush to do that sometimes be left with no room for development <e> <s> that has contributed to some of the difficulties which have arisen in establishing the areas <e>", "<cs> i think the minister has more faith in scottish homes and the professional people who will be pushing it <e> <s> i believe that when they announce their financial strategy they will have a very good idea of exactly where they are going to develop <e> <s> however i will not labour this any more at present <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the minister some questions <e> <s> although i agree with the spirit of what the noble viscount said i am not sure whether the words are right <e> <s> we do not have a shape for scottish homes which leaves us in some difficulty <e> <s> it will be much bigger than the scottish special housing association for instance which has its own structure and the housing associations which have an intimate structure and a relationship with local people <e> <s> it will probably be difficult to get sonic sort of organisation that will give the best of both those organisations <e> <s> i can see the housing association pattern for a large body such as scottish homes being a little too small finicky or oppressive <e>", "<cs> the minister will realise that i followed the proceedings in another place and found the replies then not as full as i should have liked <e> <s> i cannot say that his reply has been any better <e> <s> scottish homes will handle very large sums of government money or as ministers continually tell us taxpayers money <e> <s> taxpayers will not be allowed any observation on how that money will be spent until it appears on the contract <e> <s> that seems quite inadequate <e> <s> merely to have the assurance of the secretary of state and parliament that an annual report will be made is not enough for a body as important as this <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that i agree fully with the noble lord lord campbell of croy who asked about the confusion that exists when we talk about the national curriculum <e> <s> is he also aware that scotland has for some time had its own wide national curriculum for secondary education which leads to the sec examinations embracing english arithmetic a language and social studies and that in primary education we have had our own curriculum since <e> <s> the strength of scottish education as i think the minister hinted is due to its breadth which we certainly would not want to change <e>", "<cs> again i shall want to read the ministers statement of explanation but perhaps i may ask him a very quick question <e> <s> when a superior landlord requires the tenancy of a house who will judge whether the alternative accommodation offered is suitable be it in another part of the house another part of the building or perhaps in a different house altogether <e> <s> who will judge whether it is suitable or reasonable to ask people who already have an assured tenancy to go to other accommodation <e>", "<cs> can the minister explain whether this in any way contradicts or makes more difficult our proposal in later amendments to extend the succession period to two years if it is not a spouse with regard to an assured tenancy <e> <s> the bill provides for a six-month period of residence for the person in the house who had been living with the assured tenant before death <e> <s> however if it were a two-year tenancy would the landlord have any right to go to the sheriff to obtain possession within the <e>", "<cs> i congratulate the minister on coming back and the other noble lords particularly the noble earl lord selkirk for persisting <e> <s> on behalf of everyone who has to plough through bills and spend much time in the library tracing things perhaps i may say that it would be a great help if matters were clear <e> <s> who knows in this bill we may make a blow for clarity of legislation <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will accept the amendment <e> <s> we consider it to be a matter of great importance <e> <s> those members who have had a great deal of experience at weekly surgeries know the difficulties which arise as a result of this particularly in cities where there are a high number of single room lettings <e> <s> the single homeless are frequently in difficulty as regards raising even quite small sums of money and the cycle of visiting money lenders goes on <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for the last point he made <e> <s> however i feel that the issue before us is important <e> <s> there has been strong pressure and the matter is one at which we must look more thoroughly <e> <s> if the government get their way the working of the bill will prove to be a great problem for local councillors citizens advice <e>", "<cs> i agree with most of what the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe has said <e> <s> i am interested in the point the minister made that the public sector could still become landlords of houses transferred in the future <e> <s> i suppose that had to be put into the bill of necessity for a landlord who had the machinery and apparatus hurriedly to take over houses <e>", "<cs> the minister was speaking of polls and i know what he means <e> <s> i do not always believe them myself or i should be very unhappy <e> <s> as regards polls i think the minister totally misunderstands the folk feeling towards private factoring in scotland <e> <s> this is a terribly important matter <e> <s> i do not know whether the minister has lived with a private factor but so many people have that in their folk memory <e> <s> i hope that that phenomenon never comes back but it is a very powerful memory <e> <s> therefore i am not at all surprised at this figure <e> <s> i think that the figure of per cent <e> <s> is quite genuine in the present circumstances <e> <s> nevertheless i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the minister and i think that we are all trying to do what is right <e> <s> i hope that when reading the record of our discussion i shall remain convinced <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i hope my noble friend will accept that while i deplore the attitude in many ways i deplore the reason it started because those facts were true <e>", "<cs> i shall need to read the ministers speech carefully particularly his remarks about there being no floor price for a house and the allowances for repairs <e> <s> i believe that the matter will be dealt with in a subsequent amendment but it is an important responsibility for local authorities <e> <s> in the hope that there may be greater clarification as we deal with this group of amendments i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think that the minister has heard from the committee and particularly from the contribution by the noble lord lord hylton just what the feelings are on this subject and the worries that are involved <e> <s> it seems to me to be simple and straightforward in that if the valuation does not cover the money already spent and the outstanding debt on the house that is something very serious <e> <s> the idea of a local authority using some sort of roundabout way to get money i would say first would have something wrong with it somewhere perhaps as regards the district valuers valuation <e> <s> however we shall go further into this subject in the next amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i did not read as carefully as i should have liked this section of the bill when it was discussed in another place <e> <s> however the minister must realise that in a very rational chamber there has been grave scepticism from almost every quarter <e> <s> the noble earl lord dundee spoke about good faith and responsible people doing repairs and that sort of thing <e> <s> someone still has to judge whether repairs are adequate or correct <e> <s> if he thinks for one moment he will realise that there have been many <e>", "<cs> that is most interesting and i am grateful to the noble earl for bringing out that matter <e> <s> i do not know whether it says in the bill that a landlord will be scratched off <e> <s> we have been trying to have that measure included in the bill as the minister knows <e> <s> there is the great worry of vacant possession <e> <s> we endeavoured to get a bad landlords register at some point <e> <s> i accept that there are difficulties and no one wants scottish homes to be a nanny all the time <e> <s> however it is a little stronger than the average tenant who is caught up with a landlord <e>", "<cs> the minister has been a little more reassuring <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the minister continually comes back to the claim that scottish homes will be a highly responsible body <e> <s> we hope and assume that it will be and we know that the government will take great care in that regard <e> <s> there will also be a great necessity for scottish homes to keep its tenants informed <e> <s> that is not always the case with quangos which sometimes find it difficult to speak the same language as the people with whom they are dealing <e> <s> a great deal of effort will have to be put into this <e> <s> at the same time there will be an unprecedented growth in local activity <e> <s> local organisations and associations citizens advice bureaux law centres and political surgeries of all parties will be trying to help tenants before they make up their minds whether to transfer to scottish homes and warning them if scottish homes intends to pass them on <e> <s> we hope that the provisions will work out in the first few years but years from now the position may be very difficult <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us what powers there are <e> <s> we know that the secretary of state for scotland has said and the minister has repeated it here that if there are changes in the bill for england they will be considered for scotland <e> <s> are there any powers that will enable the secretary of state to do this <e> <s> will a separate bill be needed <e> <s> i sincerely hope that the government will not include amendments to scottish legislation on the poll tax in an english poll tax bill <e>", "<cs> i had hoped that the minister would do better on this matter than lord james douglas-hamilton the parliamentary under-secretary of state for scotland did in another place <e> <s> the minister has perhaps spoken a little more but like the noble earl lord selkirk i am not absolutely sure about this provision <e> <s> a great deal needs to be taken on trust <e>", "<cs> in the circumstances the good faith of the minister cannot be doubted <e> <s> i have great pleasure in asking leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment tabled by the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe <e> <s> i should like to point out that my noble friend lord kirkhill who has added his name to the amendment is unable to be present <e> <s> i sometimes feel sorry for the way in which we throw brickbats at the parliamentary draftsmen <e> <s> perhaps it would be nice to give them a couple of fallow years of legislation and a chance to carry on with their crafts and skills <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lady <e> <s> that was a point of which i too was thinking <e> <s> it would be much better to give the spouse a house than to go to the extent of stationing a police officer inside both in terms of peace of mind and also probably in purely economic and financial terms <e>", "<cs> i can understand the noble lords reluctance to accept the other two amendments <e> <s> i think we should be grateful that he has gone as far as he has on amendment no <e> <s> after taking advice on whether there is any overspill effect from amendment no <e> <s> on to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> perhaps that will give some reassurance to certain <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister respond to the statement made by the noble viscount lord thurso about the official figures of landings in ireland and the suggestion that the unofficial figures were much higher <e> <s> will he say whether there have been any visible signs that that is having an effect on salmon going back to the rivers in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will recall that during the discussion of the scottish bill on the community charge great concern was expressed because the last revaluation in england had taken place about years ago and because of the passage of time the necessary skills had been lost <e> <s> therefore although inland revenue staff and scottish assessment people are getting together <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not follow the line of the last question <e> <s> i know the attitude of many people in scotland on the matter and i believe that the minister is aware of that <e> <s> as regards the question since the number of people employed in scotland has dropped from million to million <e> <s> when the minister gave a figure of people unemployed he was careful to say that he was referring to claimants for unemployment pay <e> <s> because of what has happened recently many people are not allowed to register for <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the increase in productivity but i should like to ask whether the minister can give us a base date to which the figures apply <e> <s> i gave the base date to which the noble lord lord mackie of benshie referred in his question about <e> <s> surely we are discussing the progress of this government and that is the date we should take as the base line <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the minister for explaining the order <e> <s> he will be aware that orders always contain a great many cross-references and it is difficult to follow them all through <e> <s> therefore i must thank him for helping us to understand it <e> <s> i was going to ask him how many houses were involved but he told me that early in his remarks <e> <s> there are obviously households involved <e> <s> it is also interesting to note that the local authorities have repurchased houses <e> <s> i wonder whether they form part of the or are additional in other words did houses become when some were sold <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a debate which shows that we shall have a most interesting committee stage on this bill <e> <s> i look forward to that <e> <s> a great deal of material has been produced both in another place and by outside bodies on the whole question of this privatisation <e> <s> some of the speeches we have heard today were very knowledgeable on the subject <e> <s> after the speech of my noble friend lord morton of shuna there is little that needs to be said about ravenscraig <e> <s> he has been most analytical and he made a very powerful speech altogether <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in no doubt that the noble lord did write a pamphlet about this subject <e> <s> i have one or two of the pamphlets that he wrote for <e>", "<cs> my lords before i speak on the question i should like to say a word about the fact that my noble friend lord ross of marnock who directly preceded me in this job and who was a member of this and of the other house for a long time died this morning after a fairly long illness <e> <s> i am sure that the house will wish to convey its sorrow to lady ross and her family <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his answer <e> <s> he will realise that the announcement of the closure was a shock to the people of scotland despite the fact that he visited nel some weeks ago <e> <s> he made statements there which were interpreted as meaning that the government were to withdraw from the nel <e> <s> nevertheless it came as a great shock to learn that the last important and prestigious government-sponsored research establishment in scotland will change in status <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for announcing that he has placed a copy of the notes of guidance in the library and that he will send a copy to me <e> <s> perhaps after it has been thoroughly studied we can discuss the matter again <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister appeared to be complacent particularly in the scottish office press statement yesterday in endeavouring to recover from the gaffe over the lottery <e> <s> local authorities are entitled to run a lottery but to tie up a lottery with rates is a different matter <e> <s> the statement said that the registration process is proceeding satisfactorily <e> <s> does that also include the serious increase in costs to local authorities <e>", "<cs> the minister has made some very important points in relation to amendment no <e> <s> ca <e> <s> he has promised that there will be a government amendment for which we are <e>", "<cs> i was interested that the minister thought that the suggestion in the amendment was logically unsound <e> <s> the argument against the poll tax is that it is a crazy system and that it will raise all kinds of problems <e> <s> what we proposed would not at the very worst make it all that much more crazy <e> <s> in fact we believe that it would be a great improvement <e> <s> however i am sure that at this stage the minister is not prepared to move on the issue <e>", "<cs> this amendment embraces the three clauses nos <e> <s> and which were the result of a great deal of agitation in the other place when the government suggested that artificial devices were being used by local authorities in order to increase their capital spend <e> <s> that was by exchanging what is called in scotland the excambing of land and other actions involving private capital although the government agreed that all the devices used by local authorities were legal up until that point until the amendment and until the minister made the statement on th march and another statement some time in april <e>", "<cs> the ministers reply did not surprise me although it disappointed me <e> <s> as regards confidentiality someone suggested that governments always have an excuse for not giving information <e> <s> the commercial confidentiality need not be breached to give more information than is already known <e> <s> i understand that the international institute for steel has enormous resources and that few figures are unable to be obtained <e> <s> those likely to be interested in purchasing shares in the new privatised british steel will be able to find out a great deal about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for explaining the order <e> <s> he may remember that on the last occasion i spoke in praise of bureaucracy saying that everyone criticises bureaucracy <e> <s> i still believe that the bureaucrat did a good job in devising the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for the explanation that he has given of the orders which will relieve the two bodies of the need to pay the additional moneys which they would have paid in rates if the adjustment in the method of calculation had not been necessary <e> <s> i have not received representations from either of those bodies or from the business community <e> <s> however the minister has said that there has been a great deal of correspondence and a number of meetings with the bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe the house will recall that we debated this matter very fully during the passage of the channel tunnel bill <e> <s> i believed that the government were coming round to the on-train clearance system <e> <s> we know that there is a problem between british rail the department of transport and the treasury <e> <s> can the minister say whether this problem is any closer to resolution <e> <s> we know that for very many years now the french and the continentals have been operating a system with the minimum of carriage space <e> <s> however i understand that if there is on-train clearance the treasury requires one-and-a-half carriages which seems to be quite excessive <e> <s> can the minister tell us anything about the negotiations with the treasury as regards this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords in the short time that we have been debating this amendment perhaps more scots have been brought into the discussion than have spoken in any other debate that i have known in this house <e> <s> as has been said by a number of speakers the reason is that in scotland this is an emotive subject <e> <s> there is much reason for it to be so <e> <s> the industrial revolution in scotland was built largely on steel <e> <s> that steel should be seen as important is extremely pertinent to the psyche of scotland <e> <s> while we do not believe that therefore we should have steel for ever there is a feeling of betrayal when such an important industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the minister for that reply and even more grateful to the noble earl lord selkirk for pointing out the approach that scottish homes could give <e> <s> i think that it is not like any other body that has ever been established which is something of which i am sure the minister is proud <e> <s> scottish homes has a special role in that it will be the one body outside the local authorities which will know exactly what is happening in scottish housing <e> <s> i hope therefore that when it is set up it will take on that social responsibility that we spoke of in the debate on british steel earlier today and that it may widen its sphere <e> <s> i think that it will need to build up its reputation which may prove very important to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the minister for having tabled this amendment and for taking on the duties that are already on the shoulders of local authorities <e> <s> perhaps in scotland we pretend that we have better community relations than in fact is the case <e> <s> there are however great hopes in that direction <e> <s> i myself had a constituency with a very mixed community <e>", "<cs> my lords we could not but be grateful to the minister for at least extending the right of succession to the spouse although it was an appalling omission from the bill originally <e> <s> the idea that the spouse is vulnerable is a matter of which we are all very much aware but i think that our amendment no <e> <s> extends just a little further the statutory right of succession from an assured tenant to a member of the tenants family who has been living with the tenant in cases in which there is no spouse who could succeed <e> <s> the new clause is based largely on the existing legislation of the housing scotland act which limits succession in the public sector including housing association tenancies <e>", "<cs> my lords only once would someone be able to move in and that would be it <e>", "<cs> my lords from our point of view it would be silly to vote down this amendment in case we were not able to win amendment no <e> <s> which i feel sure the house will be sufficiently kindhearted enough to support <e> <s> i propose that we accept this amendment with the opportunity of voting later on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the house for rising at this late stage in the bill <e> <s> the noble earl lord selkirk raised a point to which the minister replied <e> <s> my memory is that often conditions were written onto the rent hook and that raises the question of whether there is a definition of a rent book <e> <s> i have seen some fairly tatty rent books bought in a corner shop which gave no feeling of security to the tenant <e> <s> those circumstances could apply to the type of person about whom the noble lord was talking and who it is important to catch <e> <s> perhaps some thought could be given to that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am only too pleased to have added my name and that of the noble lord lord morton of shuna to these two amendments <e> <s> the scottish council for single homeless which has very wide experience of these matters takes the view that it is not unreasonable for a landlord to have two lodgers <e> <s> it has supported the concept of the tenants rights legislation <e> <s> a household unit has been employed to cover the range of size of household that a lodger or occupier might represent <e> <s> a lodger household could be a single person a single person plus a cohabitee a married couple a single parent etc <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord morton of shuna and other noble lords have said they have had much correspondence on this issue from individuals small housing groups tenants associations and the larger bodies representing groups of tenants associations and it causes a great deal of anxiety <e> <s> it makes one realise that there is a great deal of worry about the loss of representation by either the ssha or local authorities <e> <s> people knew where they were then <e> <s> if things went wrong they knew to whom they could go <e> <s> i do not say that they were totally satisfied with what they did but at least they knew on which door to knock and it gave them a little security <e>", "<cs> my lords in general i agree with what the noble earl has said <e> <s> perhaps i may take the opportunity to ask him a question <e> <s> throughout the bill there are so many references to as may be so specified which will be specified or should be specified <e> <s> can the minister give some indication when these matters will be specified <e> <s> there is a tendency to be thankful to leave a bill and there may be a great many loose ends <e> <s> i am sure that in time they are tidied up <e> <s> i am sure that these matters would send the noble earl lord selkirk into a real tizzy in trying to work his way through all the promises that have been made <e> <s> it is a <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i should have said that i was also speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the minister did his best to try to satisfy some of the points which were raised <e> <s> he must be thinking that there is something wrong with the bill in that it does not completely satisfy everyone <e> <s> i believe that part of the problem is that the whole bill is based on the idea that supply will meet demand <e> <s> we are a long way from that <e> <s> although the minister is smiling and thinking that when this bill goes through the demand will be met i think it will need a few more bills in this house and in another place before the supply and demand in scotland are in any way balanced <e> <s> in some ways people go for the standard of living and the demands of people increase <e>", "<cs> my lords the usual channels made the recommendation that amendments nos <e> <s> and were important enough to be considered separately <e> <s> i should have mentioned that matter <e> <s> however the negotiations had not quite finished when i stood up <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his explanation of the bill and his manner of dealing with its important clauses <e> <s> we all wish to see parents play a part in the education of their children not just in the home atmosphere but in the wider area of schools and the whole environment in which young people live during their school years <e> <s> no one can seriously believe that the <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be churlish not to be grateful for the ministers statement that he has given the matter considerable thought <e> <s> from what he said it seems possible that some of our representations have not fallen on stony ground <e> <s> for that we are extremely grateful <e> <s> the noble lord will also realise that as this is extremely complicated legislation we shall want to study his words carefully see exactly what they mean in practice and naturally have some assessment from outside experts on the full potential of his words <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the trouble the minister has taken to explain the governments thinking once again in the light of some of the points that were made in committee when he said that he would look into the cost floor <e> <s> the amendment was not moved with any purely chauvinistic thoughts in mind <e> <s> it was moved as a result of a very practical consideration <e> <s> local authorities were concerned that they would be selling houses where the outstanding debt was considerably more than the price that they were able to secure for the houses <e>", "<cs> my lords the explanation of the clause which the minister has given is of great interest <e> <s> however by the nature of things he was not able to give us as much detail as we should like <e> <s> we welcome anything which brings flexibility in dealing with housing to let <e> <s> the earlier suggestion of the building of granny flats was very acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be churlish not to be grateful to the minister for having at long last persuaded the government to accept the amendment <e> <s> he has a great deal of experience of housing associations and therefore i know that he supported the proposals put forward in the housing bill of which he spoke earlier and which we raised in the earlier stages of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords did the minister say ground of schedule <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister <e> <s> i certainly understand the examples he gave <e> <s> there was the possibility of a landlord having a reasonable right to suggest alternative accommodation <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in such august legal company i should briefly like to welcome the bill <e> <s> my noble friend lord morton of shuna should be congratulated for having taken up the baton from my honourable friend in another place alistair darling <e> <s> we should also thank the law society for going into a great deal of detail in order to answer many of the calls that it has had over the years concerning solicitors and including those on the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister said the real purpose of the bill is stated in its long title <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his explanation <e> <s> i also thank him for having sent on a copy of the report of the sdd <e> <s> in some ways it is a pity although in others perhaps it is a good thing that the scottish office was not as sharp as it normally is and only decided to include this clause on the rights of tenants on report <e> <s> if the scottish office had thought of it earlier we would not have had the pleasure of listening to this most interesting debate as regards the rest of the country <e> <s> that would have been a great pity <e>", "<cs> am i correct in thinking that we are dealing with only one amendment <e> <s> the minister mentioned a set of amendments <e>", "<cs> it would be churlish not to say that the minister has gone some way towards satisfying some of the worries that were expressed in the other place <e> <s> nevertheless the amendment reinforces the criticism made of the boast that the bill is a tenants choice <e> <s> it is not it is a group tenants choice <e> <s> the tenant who is in a minority and says that he does not want to go under another landlord has no choice he must go <e>", "<cs> before the minister sits down may i ask whether he will make allowances for the suggestion on the voluntary transfer of local authority housing to private bodies contained in the sdd statement <e> <s> paragraph suggests that where there is total disposal of an authoritys stock there will be no need for a local authority to maintain a waiting list <e> <s> the statement goes on to say that the new landlord could do so and if there are several purchasers it could be advantageous for them to operate a joint waiting list or a referral service <e>", "<cs> my lords given that holidays are a vital part of everyones year and that the intolerable delays which we read about and saw if we used the airports must have disrupted so many people and must have become a social problem may i ask the following question <e> <s> has the <e>", "<cs> i believe that we should be grateful to the minister <e> <s> the original argument on the question of resources for doing the job was a genuine one <e> <s> during the discussions on the bill in this house and in another place the government were very suspicious of the figure of million put forward by cosla <e> <s> it was taking a stab at the figure and we were also very sceptical about the governments figure of million even after throwing in the little which was to be saved on the schools councils <e>", "<cs> even then the figure goes comfortably beyond the figure of million which my noble friend lord hughes mentioned <e> <s> therefore i am only too pleased to withdraw this amendment <e> <s> i thank the minister for his efforts on behalf of the committee <e>", "<cs> i am slightly disappointed that the minister does not agree with this amendment <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mackie said it seems to be helpful <e> <s> right from the beginning there is the statement that the duties placed upon a local authority by section of the education scotland act shall be binding upon the boards as well as upon the local authorities <e> <s> it makes the position very clear <e>", "<cs> i am sure the minister will be aware that his reply was rather disappointing <e> <s> he said that because the idea of school councils had not really taken off there was a feeling that something ought to be done <e> <s> i agree that something should be done but that does not mean just anything it means that much thought must be given to the matter <e> <s> i am not sure whether the ministers argument on this amendment was good enough <e>", "<cs> the minister has not been able to convince me <e> <s> however i imagine that he would be able to do so in the lobbies because votes are much more important than mere exhortations <e> <s> that is why i believe that a ballot of the parents would mean that they would contribute something <e> <s> if they put across in a ballot whether they wanted school boards they would actually be doing something <e> <s> i think it would have been one of the best ways of making them aware of the possibilities in education <e> <s> however i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the minister will not be surprised that we are disappointed with his reply <e> <s> this ground has been covered in another place and to some extent on second reading in this chamber <e> <s> the noble earl lord selkirk to whom i always listen with great interest because he brings not only knowledge but also common sense to most of our discussions made a point with which i thoroughly agreed <e> <s> he said that he hoped there would be very little voting on the boards and that if they were going to make a difference little voting should take place <e> <s> i hope that that will be the case <e>", "<cs> the minister has clearly given considerable thought to the amendment <e> <s> i can see that there are difficulties in that three parents may also be teachers in the school <e> <s> this would result in a surfeit of teachers who would have an overall majority on the school board <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his thoughtful reply and the promise he made <e> <s> there is undoubtedly a problem as was shown from the short debate we had in defining the phrase community school <e> <s> i can think of a community school that is the lifeblood of the area <e> <s> on barra there is a lovely relatively new school in castlebay <e> <s> it is vital for everything <e>", "<cs> will the minister clarify one matter <e> <s> i had the impression from what he said that the travelling teacher or the one who attended more than one school to give instruction could vote in various other schools <e> <s> i was more <e>", "<cs> we shall need to look at the matter carefully and take soundings on it <e> <s> during the course of my remarks i said that there is such a disparity in scotland that in some places it is reasonable to suppose that a teacher teaching in five different schools could become a power in the land of education <e> <s> one is always a little worried when too much power is in anyones hands <e> <s> however i thank the minister for his explanation and we shall look at the matter carefully <e>", "<cs> it is always perplexing why a simple amendment can be built up into something as important as the noble earl has made it <e> <s> i understand part of what he has explained and i shall read it in the <e>", "<cs> i feel that with both the noble lord lord mackie and the noble baroness lady carnegy ranged against me and with only my noble friend lord kirkhill to support me <e>", "<cs> yes but they probably have reserves available somewhere <e>", "<cs> having heard the ministers reply i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i was trying to make another point <e> <s> this amendment would clear up the issue because there would be a better relationship <e> <s> there would be a direct request by the board to the head teacher as long as it was understood that the head teacher was ultimately responsible to the education authority <e> <s> i was suggesting that if there was not that line of command and if he were so inclined a head teacher could adopt a dog-in-the manger attitude <e> <s> if he felt that the school board was trying to order him about he could easily respond by replying in writing instead of going along and being a part of the proceedings <e> <s> that is how i read the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to make just one point in relation to the intervention by the noble baroness lady carnegy <e> <s> i suggested that one of the effects of this amendment would be to avoid creating a situation of conflicting responsibilities which would jeopardise the smooth working between the head teacher and the school board <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord lord mackie of benshie has put the argument extremely well <e> <s> i do not think that there is anything wrong in a new body such as a school board learning from the experience of long-established local authorities in their longstanding local government practice <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the minister for what he has said <e> <s> it is a small matter until the time comes when the decision has to be made <e> <s> we do not want any bad feeling i am talking about on the board and not in this committee although i think we would probably come off better if we decided things by lot rather than by vote <e> <s> however i am grateful to the minister for agreeing to give the issue further thought and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his explanation <e> <s> he dealt fairly with the points especially sub-paragraph a <e> <s> i readily accept that the point is covered in clause <e> <s> he also make the important point that under the amendment the board would be allowed to institute legal proceedings <e> <s> i can see that there may be problems there <e> <s> while i am grateful to the minister <e>", "<cs> my noble friend sat over there for a long time and his is obviously the voice of authority <e> <s> i am glad that i stopped short of showing enthusiasm for the ministers reply which was complicated and dealt with an important point <e> <s> i shall consider it in time for report and in order to do that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i was going to ask exactly the same question as my noble friend lord hughes <e> <s> must the boards have standing orders <e> <s> if they must although the minister has suggested that guidelines will be given at the end of the day would local authorities decide whether the standing orders were acceptable or not even with variations <e> <s> i think that this could become quite dangerous if there were not at least a helping hand to try to have some sort of standard within the standing orders <e> <s> i do not want any suggestion of big brother but i should like to be able to feel that the way a school board <e>", "<cs> i think that many of us would agree with the noble lord that standing orders can be used in many ways <e> <s> local authorities have been in existence for a long time <e> <s> they have standing orders and they have a lot of experience <e> <s> i am told that london transport for instance has sold its mistakes all over the world <e> <s> it has had so much experience that it knows much of what has happened in its field <e> <s> the same applies with local authorities <e> <s> if the minister really means what he was implying earlier that standing orders could vary greatly from one part of the country to another i do not think that would be helpful at all <e> <s> i would hope that one could move from one part of scotland to another and understand that the school board was by and large operating on the same basic standing orders <e>", "<cs> i accept that <e> <s> the minister is edging closer to the fact that there may be model standing orders issued however they may be termed <e> <s> therefore with that assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i was aware that it had been decided that there would be remuneration <e> <s> i certainly take the point of the noble earl lord selkirk on the importance of the clerk <e> <s> it sounds as though we are being very wordy and bureaucratic but the point about good clerking and good bureaucratic work is that they help to avoid problems later on <e>", "<cs> i think that the impression has been created largely by members on the other side of the chamber in particular the noble baroness lady blatch and to a lesser extent the noble baroness lady carnegy that with the last few amendments we have been trying to build up a huge superstructure <e> <s> believe me i see the role of the clerk and of the standing orders and other matters which we have discussed solely as a means of getting rid of these things so that the boards can do their own job confident that they are satisfying the requirements of the government their local authority the education authority and the council <e>", "<cs> i am happy with the ministers reply to the extent that on every occasion that he speaks in consideration of the bill i learn more about how it will work and i suspect that he is in the same position because what appeared to be a simple bill is in fact a rather complicated affair <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as the minister is aware this is a very important part of the bill <e> <s> i should like to look very closely at the answer he gave to the noble earl lord selkirk on the legal status of a school board <e> <s> it seems ridiculous when we have been considering this matter for so long but we now have it down to a fine definition <e>", "<cs> i am interested to know whether the minister can show me where in the bill all these allowances are made <e> <s> it is not just a case of shall have regard <e> <s> where is it more fully stated so that those in further education or some facet of our community schools will have rights as well as merely the right to say we would like <e> <s> i presume that in that case without any reason the chairman of a school board would have the power to say no you cannot use the swimming pool the science labs or anything else <e> <s> i should like to know perhaps not now but at a later stage <e> <s> i thought the minister gave it rather more <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister <e> <s> i shall examine the clause <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that at this late hour we wish to become involved in that issue <e> <s> however it appears that when we speak in terms of organising the working of the committee in a functional sense we are accused of trying to become too bureaucratic <e> <s> yet according to what the minister said the number of controls on the expenditure of the boards will be such that they will be even more controlled <e> <s> the noble baroness lady carnegy said that they would be allocated so much and there would be a small contingency fund <e> <s> that appears to be leaving little room for imagination <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his honesty although that is not unusual <e> <s> he must be aware and was probably as shocked as i was that the concept of lobbying was brought into the matter <e> <s> it is a long way before that happens <e>", "<cs> i think we all agree that the minister has done extremely well <e> <s> he has given us as much as he can at this stage and there is hope for the future <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the ministers reply was very helpful <e> <s> i believe that the amendment gave him the opportunity to make certain points which were of value <e> <s> the amendment merely asks that the report has statements on curriculum policy and pupil progress in the full range of learning experience offered within the school <e> <s> i believe that the minister tried to answer that <e> <s> i was particularly pleased at the reassurance he gave as regards the confidentiality of reports <e> <s> that was causing a certain amount of trouble and that reassurance is well worth while <e>", "<cs> i intend to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> we were trying to point out that there could be the prospect of considerable disagreement over issues raised by the board which might have been resolved quite easily had they first been raised with the headmaster <e> <s> perhaps it was <e>", "<cs> i am again grateful to the minister <e> <s> we must have dinner more often before we come to amendments as we seem to have reached a nice point <e>", "<cs> this is just one of the problems <e> <s> i can understand the point the minister is making but we tend to have schools and we all know of them which are popular geographically or which happen to have facilities which attract for instance the local rugby club dances or similar events <e> <s> then because of the fees people would tend to make that a mecca perhaps to the detriment of other areas or other schools <e>", "<cs> i cut short my remarks earlier to allow the debate to develop <e> <s> however i could have mentioned the difficulties involved in in-service training <e> <s> we want teachers to be continually brought up to date <e> <s> yet considerable chaos could result if that training coincided either with teachers days off in another part of the area or if teachers arranged to go to school and the school board decided without a great deal of notice that there was to be a holiday on a particular day <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the minister or the noble baroness lady carnegy paid sufficient attention to the fact that the school boards and the education authority could reach agreement to take delegation powers earlier <e> <s> it may be good if school boards were able to tell local education authorities that they were ready for the work within the three-year period and were willing to talk it over <e> <s> i am assuming that the bill is accepted in good faith by both groups the education authorities and the school boards <e> <s> they are both out to do the best they can within the limits of the bill for scottish <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the minister has taken that view of the amendment <e> <s> i thought that it had more potential <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the minister is on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i lost the beginning of the ministers statement because i believed he was on the wrong amendment so perhaps he will allow me to withdraw the amendment now read what he said and think of what steps to take in preparation for report stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for promising to look again at section of the act <e> <s> in turn i will certainly examine his words with care <e> <s> i am grateful for his explanation and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will be aware that there was also a report that iata would he meeting nato to discuss air space use by the military forces <e> <s> is the minister aware that sir colin marshall said that in america something like per cent <e> <s> extra flying was required because of military flying whereas in europe it is about per cent <e> <s> additional flying miles <e> <s> can the minister say whether this meeting was actually held and if so what the result was <e>", "<cs> i had no desire to use a sledgehammer to crack a nut in this situation <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness described this matter rather better than i did <e> <s> no one wants to make this procedure unnecessarily cumbersome but there is a point at which protection becomes necessary <e> <s> the minister seemed to hint that there were powers in the bill in this regard <e> <s> will he expand on that <e>", "<cs> i have no desire to prolong this discussion <e> <s> however i remind the minister that these boards do not even need to make annual reports to parents according to the bill <e> <s> therefore i do not know how the parents would know about any malpractice <e> <s> but perhaps this is something we can look at again <e>", "<cs> we shall watch for the publication of the amendments for report <e>", "<cs> amendments nos <e> <s> to inclusive have already been debated and disposed of <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will give sympathetic consideration to the amendment <e> <s> there is always concern about abuses and there have been cases of abuse of attendance allowances in local authorities <e> <s> i am sure that the problem occurs more widely <e> <s> it should be remembered that the idea behind the introduction of the allowances was to try to achieve some equity and a reasonable spread of representation <e> <s> because someone happened to have a private income it was almost an abuse of their comfort and security that they were able to take on certain jobs that others were not able to do because of the necessity to earn a living <e> <s> i think that we should always remember that a great many people who were in the position of having to have an attendance allowance almost certainly gave up the chance of promotion by taking part in public service <e> <s> i know hundreds of such people <e>", "<cs> we should be grateful to my noble friend lord hughes for his openmindedness because he has said that he has changed his mind about one or two matters to which he had put his name <e> <s> he spoke powerfully and with a great deal of experience of appointments and short leets <e>", "<cs> i should not like to say which is the parent body but it is obvious that head teachers are concerned and involved parties in the procedure for making appointments <e> <s> the noble baroness suggested that she wanted people to move to and from the school board and we should also like to see that <e> <s> however we had to drag out of the government correspondence and information which we have been promised only later from the school boards to the parents <e> <s> i earlier gained the impression that there may not even need to be an annual report because nothing may have been done <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble and learned lord is probably correct <e> <s> this is a probing amendment to obtain the governments view <e> <s> there is a role on the board for the staff member who has been on the board continually who knows how it works and has the feel of it and who also knows the feel of the school in general and so perhaps can help in that intangible way in deciding whether or not someone will fit in <e> <s> however i believe that there are difficulties in that another member of staff could be applying for the post <e> <s> i shall look with care at what the noble and learned lord said <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the minister will realise that he made a very important and detailed reply with many references and cross-references <e> <s> at this stage i believe the best that i can do is to withdraw the amendment and read what he said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i agree with my noble friend that in the light of what the minister said my amendments would be taking rather more powers than are required <e> <s> however it should also be accepted that the lothian parents action group and education alert were putting these amendments forward when there was a great inadequacy of routes for allowing parents to be aware of what is happening in the schools <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e> <s> i assume that i can take it from his words that there is no conflict with the schedule and with the local government finance act <e> <s> if that is the case i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for tabling these amendments <e> <s> we have no basic objection to them <e> <s> i have just one query <e> <s> some of the amendments are removing amendments which were earlier scottish provisions added at committee stage <e> <s> however <e> <s> we have no objection to the amendments and i thank the minister for bringing them forward <e>", "<cs> i think that confusion always occurs when there are cross-references between this bill and the scottish legislation <e> <s> it becomes quite difficult <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the minister for his explanation of the draft order <e> <s> i have looked at it and i notice that the largest change in electorate is which is in the clydebank milngavie county constituency and glasgow garscadden borough constituency <e> <s> i have received no representations on this matter although as the minister will know i am familiar with most of the people in another place and in the local authority area who are likely to be affected <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for having put down these amendments which as he said were mentioned in general in an earlier part of the discussion on this bill particularly the sections on those areas relating to scotland <e> <s> i think that the government are beginning to appreciate that there is genuine unease among tenants about the change of tenancy and of owners <e> <s> there is a long history of landlordism in scotland which could not exactly be called a proud history <e> <s> therefore there is unease both from direct experience and from folk experience and a great deal of protection is required <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his explanation and the trouble he has taken <e> <s> the very fact that the ministers right honourable friend wrote to mr reynolds in the terms he did shows that the secretary of state from his experience knows the anxieties that people have <e>", "<cs> my lords i was aware of the effect of clause <e> <s> i can understand the ministers point of view <e> <s> i think that i shall need to put a note in my copy of the bill referring to the ministers speech as it appears in <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage of the bill it is always nice to have something accepted although the minister must agree that it is a small concession <e> <s> however it may very well be an important one for many tenants <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his further comments and i shall read them with great care <e> <s> we are at the very last stage of the bill but these amendments were submitted largely by very good and interested bodies and i shall consult with them and take advice <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i do not desire to speak for particularly long on this subject <e> <s> i have no <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord mackie of benshie for moving his amendment and for suggesting that on balance the amendment in my name is preferable <e> <s> i suggest modestly that he is probably correct because my amendment is rather more flexible than his <e> <s> i hope therefore that on reflection he will agree that if we are to take this issue any further it would be better to approve the amendment in my name <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> formally <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for having taken heed of the debate we had earlier on this matter <e> <s> i thank him for his flexibility <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am pleased that the minister has paid heed to what was said in committee <e> <s> we should have liked to go a little further but we must be grateful for whatever the minister gives us <e> <s> i am very pleased to accept his amendment and i thank him for it <e>", "<cs> my lord the minister has not gone as far as we had hoped <e> <s> however he has confirmed that the board itself will have the last word in all the decisions which come from the subcommittees and that is reassuring <e> <s> i am not sure that his example was perfect <e> <s> i should have thought that a bankrupt would be a better authority on finance than many people who serve on the boards <e> <s> however i take the general drift of his argument <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the one part of this complicated amendment which i really understand is paragraph c <e> <s> that seems to me to give a focus for the board so that the only person on whom a writ could be served is the clerk to the board <e> <s> even in the example which i gave of a writ or correspondence being addressed to a school it would be addressed not to an individual but to the clerk to the board <e> <s> i thought that that obviated any confusion between the boards power to arrange for the discharge of its functions by anyone other than the clerk except in this rather legalistic matter of the serving of writs which has been included in paragraph c <e>", "<cs> my lords i am slightly confused on the last point <e> <s> i can understand that the office of the clerk might be vacant for whatever reason and that the tightness of the suggestion in subsection c might therefore be restrictive <e> <s> however is it not the case that service could be made on individual members of the board <e> <s> in that case i am told that the law is clear and the service would be ineffective <e> <s> the noble and learned lord the lord advocate is present in the chamber and i am sure he will clear up that point of law <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i can see the difficulty <e> <s> it could be taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut <e> <s> however perhaps the minister could think in terms of at least model guidelines or model standing orders being issued <e> <s> there will be a number of groups which are inexperienced in these matters and it would be helpful if there were some kind of form or standard <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am only too pleased with these statements from the minister <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disappointed <e> <s> i can understand that in certain circumstances one will be fortunate enough to recruit people who are able competently to carry out this work <e> <s> however in many other cases perhaps the majority it may not be posssible <e> <s> therefore it would be better to appoint a clerk with some more specialised knowledge <e>", "<cs> my lords if my amendment is in any way flawed i understand perfectly well that the minister is unable to accept it <e> <s> perhaps he would allow me to take it away and consider it again after consultation <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for taking on board the genuine feeling expressed by various parts of the house on the question of reports and by bringing forward these amendments <e> <s> i am not sure whether it is quite adequate <e> <s> the guidelines will need to be specific <e> <s> in certain cases there will need to be special seminars to keep chairmen in touch with members <e> <s> a horror we have in mind is that small groups may dictate to a whole area providing even less responsibility than the locally elected representatives <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that one must not over-restrict the boards with legal necessities and we have tried to avoid doing so <e> <s> when looking into the crystal ball of the future one can see many more desirable things <e> <s> we have chosen to raise with the government what appear to be obvious areas where danger may arise <e> <s> however they feel sufficiently sanguine that they have the matter under control and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the government have paid attention as i am sure they always do to what was said in your lordships house on the last occasion and have come some way towards meeting our anxieties <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may try to explain that if occasional holidays also meant that they could be taken when there was in-service training involved it would mean that in the main teachers would not be able to participate in the reasons for the specific occasional holiday <e> <s> i am thinking in terms of something like the lanimer fair in lanark which is an ancient holiday and there are many other border holidays where one would not want confusion <e> <s> i believe that there would be great trouble if the teaching staff of schools were not able to take part in the riding of the marshes <e> <s> that is what i am trying to achieve namely that special local holidays should be quite distinct from in-service training in which teachers are involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that this could be an omission that could lead to considerable local difficulties <e> <s> perhaps some sort of general direction at a later point is needed <e> <s> i am sorry that the government did not see fit to consider the matter more fully but i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords again i thank the minister who has gone a long way in general to meet our queries <e> <s> there were a couple of points that i had intended to raise but by and large the minister has satisfied me <e> <s> i thank him for bringing forward the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a feeling that we do not yet have this right but i am sure the minister will read what has been said <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord mackie of benshie for raising that point which is but one of the many permutations that may arise on the question of competitive tendering <e> <s> i can envisage this becoming one of those classic cases which almost everyone in the area will understand and therefore there will be considerable pressure on the board <e> <s> it is a matter with which everyone will be able to quickly familiarise themselves <e> <s> i believe that either the secretary of state will be extremely busy or there may be quite a difficult situation arising from it <e> <s> however we shall read the ministers words <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for these amendments and i thank him also for giving me some background notes <e> <s> there is no doubt that he has gone some way towards what we were suggesting in earlier stages of the bill and for that everyone will he happy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord sanderson for accepting the suggestion that i made <e> <s> we on this side of the house do not have the facilities that the noble lord has therefore we are only too pleased to have the words that we put down tightened up and made easier to understand <e> <s> it is now much more likely that notices of legal proceedings from outside bodies will be served on boards and not addressed to the headmaster which may have been the case otherwise <e> <s> we are very pleased <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am grateful to the noble lord for looking at this point and bringing it back in a form of words that leaves little doubt as to its meaning <e> <s> this means that the minutes of the board will be authenticated and totally accepted <e> <s> i am very pleased that we have reached this agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his explanation <e> <s> i have made some inquiries i have found no adverse comments on the order <e> <s> on the contrary most people seem to be in complete agreement with it <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble and learned lord for his full explanation which i am sure will find a place in many legal offices in scotland <e> <s> i had not before heard the phrase in connection with small claims courts but i thought that user-friendly was a particularly felicitous description <e> <s> i am not sure how close it comes to reality but the idea is to make it as user-friendly as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords may i reinforce the point made by the noble lord lord grimond <e> <s> the minister must be aware from our debate on the docks and harbours legislation that there is great discrepancy on the continent as against british ports <e> <s> i hope that the government will be careful not to discriminate adding charges which will disadvantage the british ports <e>", "<cs> my lords the debate has shown that its purpose and that of the inquiry and the report is to examine the cause or causes of the fire <e> <s> it is also to discover how it may be possible to ensure that there is no repetition of such a tragedy <e> <s> it is tragic that on the day chosen to debate this subject in your lordships house we are told of the tragedy at clapham junction <e> <s> the minister may be able to update the house on the details of the accident <e> <s> i understand that the death toll may be close to that at kings cross <e> <s> i am sure that the condolences of all noble lords go to relatives of the injured and deceased not only at kings cross but also clapham junction <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that everyone would agree that this has been a very interesting and full debate <e> <s> particularly when one is on this side of the chamber when this point is reached everything has been said and since i am not competent to give the answers to many points raised by noble lords that makes matters more difficult <e> <s> obviously i shall look forward to what the minister tells us <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry <e> <s> i appreciate now what the noble lord was saying <e> <s> i believe that it is a great pity that we have lost the roads for children to play in <e> <s> they were part of the growing-up process and they were a great help to many children <e> <s> i was staggered by the increase in traffic and by the information given by the minister <e> <s> i believe he said that there are now million licences <e> <s> every time one looks at the figure it is increasing <e> <s> there is no playing in the roads now <e> <s> i believe that there is a point at which local authorities should be involved in order to give guidance as regards the kinds of roads that should be used for road space as referred to by the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth <e> <s> we know what we mean when we say that a road is a residential road or otherwise <e> <s> i can see a much beleaguered minister finding difficulties with the centre of a big city and deciding to open up roads when local residents and the local authorities find it to be quite wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his explanation of the regulations which conform closely to the statement made in another place by his honourable friend lord james douglas-hamilton <e> <s> no objections were made from my side of the house <e> <s> i have looked to see whether anyone else had any comments to make <e> <s> the department obviously consulted widely before it tabled the regulations for which there has been general agreement <e> <s> i am pleased to accept the regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend lord hughes <e> <s> the mistake was perhaps compounded by me in that his name was not included in the list <e> <s> i am pleased with the gracious way he has dealt with the matter and i look forward to hearing him speak with his great experience on this subject at a later date <e>", "<cs> it is a small point and i do not remember noticing it in legislation before <e> <s> the amendment says <e>", "<cs> we can be nothing but gracious towards the minister since he has been gracious enough to accept the amendment <e> <s> i am happy with the result <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that reply and for his elucidation of the proposed method <e> <s> there is a slight difficulty in that we want uniformity over the entire country <e> <s> although in general i am in favour of an ongoing assessment of riders before they go for a full test i should have thought it would he helpful if they had a feeling within themselves that at least they were through the first part and could go on to the proper test <e> <s> however in view of the ministers remarks i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the minister said that there would be an ongoing test and that is when the rider would get the certificate <e> <s> if a young person had spent a lot of time in training but moved before he took his test would he need to go back to the beginning in the new area before applying for his full test <e>", "<cs> i note what the minister says but in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> while i have a great deal of sympathy with the amendment i have doubts on one point <e> <s> for many years i have tried to <e>", "<cs> before the minister sits down can he tell us whether there was a time when there was a suggestion contained in the <e>", "<cs> i must thank the noble lord for his most detailed and helpful explanation <e> <s> my noble friend and i will need to look at what he has said with some care but in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> again i am very grateful to the minister for the way he has explained the governments position <e> <s> he says that the amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> i should like to study what he has said and in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his explanation <e> <s> the bill merely refers to those vehicles using route guidance <e> <s> i am curious to find out what would happen if a lorry driver just decided that he would go on a particular prohibited road if he did not have a guidance system in the cab <e> <s> one does not need to have a system <e> <s> it would obviously be helpful to some but it may be a long time before the large goods vehicles have it <e> <s> therefore will those lorries not be able to go as and where they like <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we should be reasonably grateful to the minister for that response and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that explanation and also for the information that the horne report is still sticking out of the pigeon-hole in his department <e> <s> we hope that at some time it will fall out onto his desk <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware i am sure he must be and concerned that the outrun figures for most local authorities including conservative controlled local authorities have come out well above the estimates put forward by the secretary of state in november <e> <s> can the minister tell the house whether any previous secretary of state has issued estimates for local rates ahead of the time that the local authorities announced them <e> <s> we are surprised that he did <e> <s> why did he issue these figures <e> <s> was it not enough of a problem to get this unpopular tax on the statute book without causing more distress to local councillors of all parties <e> <s> the minister must be aware that the increases of some conservative controlled local authorities compared with the estimates of the secretary of state are much higher than others <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that we took particular pleasure in the announcement made by his honourable friend in another place about the number of bypasses which arc important to the quality of life of so many people <e> <s> he mentioned an additional billion on repairs <e> <s> will that be enough to cope with the backlog of repairs built up over the past five or six years <e> <s> i refer in particular to repairs in cities and towns <e> <s> i know that those are not specifically the governments responsibility but the minister must be aware that many urban roads are in a quite deplorable state <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that those figures will be read with some disbelief by most people in scotland <e> <s> if productivity has risen as his statistics seem to indicate has it not been at the expense of heavy unemployment <e> <s> the minister will be aware of the enormous losses suffered since nearly jobs in singers in goodyear in massey ferguson and in british aluminium <e> <s> i could go on and on <e> <s> at the expense of creating good statistics which people begin to disbelieve we have lost the production of all those factories and caused a great deal of unemployment and loss of heart for many people <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will also be aware that the statistics have changed slightly <e> <s> in my old constituency we have a large supermarket providing jobs <e> <s> they work out at full-time jobs but according to the statistics this is what is worrying about statistics they are classed as jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords i have great sympathy with the suggestion that some form of research should be conducted <e> <s> perhaps the minister will be able to tell us how costly that would be and whether there are other bodies of research which could impinge on the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister must have been fascinated by the debate and i too found it most interesting <e> <s> i have no doubt that the test would contribute to reducing road accidents <e> <s> however as i said in an earlier debate it is perhaps not a case of one life saved not being worth it <e> <s> i know what the minister meant by that <e> <s> what i believe he suggests and what i have always felt about methods of trying to reduce accidents is that we must look at what changes we can digest at any one time <e> <s> therefore the minister and the department have the job of analysing the causes of accidents looking at the ways in which they can be avoided and the ways in which the greatest good can at any given time be obtained from the efforts made because resources are always limited <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a debate that we had in substance in the committee stage of the bill <e> <s> i thank the minister for his letter dated th january following the second reading which deals with this particular point <e> <s> in the last paragraph of his letter he says <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept a fair amount of what the minister says about the difficulties involved <e> <s> however i do not think that the comparison between the departmental tests and the proposed training courses is apt <e> <s> the departmental tests concern professional civil servants who arc thoroughly tested and retested themselves and have a supervisory structure above them <e> <s> the amendment refers to those who will take people through the preliminary test which will be so to speak much more cosy than the ministry test <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for listening to and taking heed of what my noble friend lord underhill said in committee <e> <s> it is good that we can get rid of a possible misunderstanding in the bill that could have led to difficulties <e> <s> in the case of both amendments we are grateful to the minister for the way in which he has responded <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the minister for that lengthy explanation <e> <s> it was very reassuring <e> <s> as i said when i moved the amendment i had reservations about the police national computer being used <e> <s> i am pleased with the explanation that he has given <e> <s> i am reassured by the fact that it is not easy to use the pnc unless arrangements are made with the individual chief police officers <e> <s> the minister has also reinforced to my satisfaction the view that the employer has a responsibility to check on suitability <e> <s> i am pleased enough with his reply <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the feeling in scotland about prestwick extends right across the party divide and that in another place the feelings of members of all parties are extremely strong <e> <s> is he also aware that the defence of prestwick is considered almost as a national symbol and that some of the figures produced suggest that prestwick is not always treated with the fairness that one expects <e> <s> can the minister tell the house whether it is true that for example highland express is charged and per passenger to land at prestwick whereas the same plane belonging to the same company is charged only and per passenger to land at stansted <e> <s> that is one of the reasons for such strong feelings regarding stansted <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that a real sense of urgency is required <e> <s> he will have seen the report issued in another place by the select committee drawing particular attention to the time lag between a decision and implementation in two spheres first new runways and secondly the training of air traffic controllers <e> <s> does he not agree that unless major decisions are taken very soon not only in this country but jointly with other countries in western europe there will be a very serious long term problem as regards air space congestion and that that will not hit us for another five or years <e> <s> however discussion must now be started on those matters <e>", "<cs> my lords first perhaps i may thank the minister for his explanation of the bill and his commendable brevity <e> <s> he went through the bill explaining the purpose of the government <e> <s> since he has been through the proceedings in another place and knows the bare bones of the bill he will no doubt be aware that the provisions have been thoroughly raked over there <e>", "<cs> my lords just to show that there can be different points of view in scotland i should say that my honourable friend in another place who represents the western isles thinks strangely enough that things would be better left as they are <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that the was promised some months ago <e> <s> however the imminent approach of the final closure has greatly concentrated the minds of the supporters of newbattle abbey college <e> <s> i understand that there was a meeting on monday <e> <s> i do not have the results of that and the minister may have more knowledge on that than i have <e> <s> however i understand that education authorities and many trade unions including the eis which i understand is a fairly wealthy union were going to look at the matter in quite a different way particularly since the question of the sale of land referred to by the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe has come to the fore <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord ferrier that as much traffic as possible should be taken away from the south-east <e> <s> perhaps we can all agree on that whatever methods one uses to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is most grateful to the noble lord lord montagu of beaulieu for the way he introduced the bill <e> <s> indeed other noble lords have commented upon the fact that he did so with a great deal of completeness and that he displayed a great knowledge of the area <e> <s> however it is <e> <s> also only fair that the house should recognise that the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth who was born in southampton obviously has a knowledge which most of us certainly myself do not have <e> <s> he too raised many points which cannot be totally ignored <e> <s> however having read the literature i believe that most of those points can be answered and will not be ignored <e> <s> i think that one can say that the noble lord spoke with a certain subdued passion about the whole business <e> <s> in my view one of his main points was obvious when one looked at the plans namely that it is not a circular system <e> <s> that point has also been mentioned by many noble lords tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the figures he gave are not the total cost of this tax to local authorities in scotland <e> <s> there is still a large capital involvement in replacing some of the temporary accommodation that was required portakabins and so on <e> <s> another hidden cost to local authorities is the considerable amount of work confirmed by the ministers noble friend sitting behind him in helping people to complete their forms particularly when social security and rebates are involved <e> <s> great distress has been caused <e> <s> as for the noble earl who said that the tax is welcomed in scotland when the bills begin to come through and in some cases sadly the bailiffs are seen in the streets the community charge will not be as popular as the noble earl seems to think <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that this tax has caused a great deal of distress in scotland <e> <s> there are long queues at the district and regional authority offices there are people in great distress over how to fill in the forms and there are people having to pay who have never paid before and who are in very seriously deprived circumstances <e> <s> what is really annoying people is the whole question of the tax not being in any way related to the ability to pay <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his full and helpful explanation of the background to the regulations <e> <s> when such regulations come before the house we are always amazed at just how low levels of income must be before legal aid is available <e> <s> the table in the civil legal aid financial conditions scotland regulations shows that if one has a weekly income exceeding but not exceeding one pays <e> <s> if one has an income of to a week one pays for advice <e> <s> if one earns more than that one pays the full amount <e> <s> whatever ones views of the various points in the lord chancellors green papers i listened to some of the debate a week ago there is no doubt that the noble and learned lord was on to something when he suggested that the legal processes should be made more available to people <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a very long debate and i hope that i can be relatively brief <e> <s> these benches and i in particular are waiting for scottish answers <e> <s> that means that i am at a disadvantage <e> <s> my noble friend lord macaulay who spoke earlier also made that point <e> <s> like other noble lords i should pay tribute to the noble baroness lady hooper for her speech <e> <s> the tributes paid to her were very proper <e> <s> this is a dreadful bill to defend and she made the best of a bad case <e> <s> she did what she could as did her advisers and writers but one cannot sell bad goods to intelligent people <e> <s> during the debate i made a note of the tenor of the speeches from the other side <e> <s> the noble baroness should not take my figures too much to <e>", "<cs> the purpose of the amendment is to provide that there shall be a deputy director appointed by the secretary of state <e> <s> whether or not that appointment was made by the secretary of state for scotland it would certainly be made by the government <e> <s> he would be a deputy with powers in scotland and he would liaise with the director general of electricity supply in the uk <e> <s> he would have the power of decison-making within scotland <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his reply and for the information that he discussed the matter with the electricity consultative council for the north of scotland <e> <s> he is correct in saying that the amendment arose largely because of the councils worries but he will see from the reference that i made to the select committee it was a unanimous decison of the all-party select committee that it is not something which merely came internally from scotland <e> <s> i believe that it arose because the structure of the industry in scotland is quite different from that south of the border <e> <s> what is suitable for one would perhaps not be suitable for the other <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for having given the assurance particularly on the second amendment that she will look at it perhaps with a view to bringing the matter back <e>", "<cs> i think that we should be grateful to the noble lord lord campbell of croy for introducing the amendment <e> <s> the minister will be aware of the special place that the hydro-electric board has in the minds of the people of scotland because it has directly and indirectly brought a great deal of benefit to the highlands <e> <s> i looked up the order referred to by the noble lord lord campbell of croy which defined the north of scotland hydro-electric board <e> <s> it made me slightly uneasy as to why it had been omitted from the original definition <e> <s> although it is not written in tablets of stone the very fact that there was a variation order in shows that a variation order can still be put through both houses at any time <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for explaining his amendment <e> <s> my problem is that i believe that it would be difficult to compel local authorities to spend surplus money from parking meters on providing off-street parking <e> <s> i believe that they should be given flexibility but to compel them to use the money for that purpose is unrealistic <e>", "<cs> again i must congratulate the noble lord on his ingenuity in introducing these amendments but in this case i hope that the minister has something good to say because the general tenor of the noble lords speech was very worthy of consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there is a growing feeling in scotland that the present situation of nominating prestwick as the sole gateway airport for north american traffic is making everyone look ridiculous and that the scottish press and everyone else is convinced that it is silly <e> <s> will the minister convey to his right honourable friends the secretaries of state for scotland and for transport that if they intend to continue with that policy they should start to give the scottish people some convincing reasons for it <e> <s> until now we have had no reasons <e> <s> we have been given a bonus in terms of the fact that there may be a rail link and that in years time there may be a new motorway but that does not remove the feeling that the whole thing is preposterous <e>", "<cs> my lords we should all congratulate my noble friend lord underhill on having chosen this subject for debate <e> <s> in transport terms it is one of the best debates that we have had for a long time <e> <s> we should also thank the minister for speaking immediately after my noble friend and for giving us some helpful figures <e> <s> he was possibly a little complacent <e> <s> he seemed to be saying that he was unaware of the fact that london especially is grinding to a halt and that some of the roads out of london in particular the m is in the same position <e>", "<cs> we should be grateful to the noble lord lord campbell of croy for putting down this amendment which will be welcomed by people in rural areas all over britain particularly in scotland <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord renton that identical would seem to be a weak point <e> <s> however in any such matter there is always a rough average over a large number of people <e> <s> things will never be identical but there will be a rough average <e> <s> it is the basis of so many measurements in sociology and areas such as work study <e> <s> everyone works differently but there is a rough average in the way people work <e> <s> therefore the amendment is not as vague as first appears to be the case <e>", "<cs> i also have my name to the amendment and am delighted to support it <e> <s> there is a feeling in scotland towards the north <e> <s> people who live in other parts of scotland feel that strongly <e> <s> i found that as a junior minister any time i was near the north of scotland especially inverness i made a point on my own of contacting the highlands and islands development board to visit it as a courtesy <e> <s> i discovered that every other scottish minister quite independently had decided to do the same thing <e> <s> we all had the feeling that somehow or other we should spread the decision-making process as widely as possible in scotland <e> <s> i found both junior and senior ministers in different departments felt that they should do that <e> <s> i believe that the hidb has been a boon in many ways psychologically as well as in purely practical terms <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister <e> <s> i did not realise that my syntax was so bad until i read what i thought was a rather pedantic group of amendments <e> <s> i shall need to think very clearly when using this sort of language again so that <e>", "<cs> i am disappointed that the provision is not spelt out a little more clearly in the bill though i suggested that the subsection would allow a way out for local authorities <e> <s> the supply and provision of electricity through waste <e>", "<cs> i am sure the minister will be pleased to know that i too have a communication from the trade unions <e> <s> we accept this amendment in the new clause <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that there is nothing like the same problem in the glasgow and prestwick areas that there is in the london area <e> <s> is he aware that the scottish people are puzzled about conflicting reports on prestwick <e> <s> is he further aware that his right honourable friend the secretary of state for defence and one of my honourable friends in another place have questioned closely rumours of reports and financial statements being doctored by official bodies in order to lean one way or the other between prestwick and glasgow <e> <s> would it not be better to conduct a full investigation and review of the advantages and disadvantages of glasgow prestwick and edinburgh so that the scottish people could make up their minds on the basis of facts <e>", "<cs> the minister must be working from an earlier marshalled list <e> <s> there is a correction on the latest marshalled list pointing out that the business shall not be resold <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble lord lord tordoff that the minister is persuasive <e> <s> he assured us that were he in charge everything would be absolutely all right and that there would be nothing even faintly shady <e> <s> however i still felt uneasy at the end of his speech <e> <s> the noble earl lord perth said that we can accept the ministers recommendation in regard to amendments nos <e> <s> and but his explanation was woefully inadequate in regard to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for the care he has taken over his reply to these amendments <e> <s> we shall however have another chance to look at the matter <e> <s> i think he will agree especially as regards the points made about the protection of assets that we need to consider the issues raised at leisure and to read in <e>", "<cs> in some respects the minister has helped but in others he has clouded the issues <e> <s> i understand the question of the divulging of prices during the process but i am not sure how long afterwards matters should still be commercially confidential <e> <s> i am always a little worried about commercial confidentiality it is a phrase which is considerably abused <e>", "<cs> we shall all await with great interest the appointment of the board <e> <s> i am sure that a number of members of the committee on both sides of the chamber will pu their names forward <e> <s> however we shall await with great interest the appointment of the board <e> <s> perhaps we shall return to this issue on a later occasion <e> <s> the minister is so reasonable that it is difficult to object to many of the things he says <e> <s> he makes his remarks with the best of intentions <e> <s> i can only hope that the provisions are carried out with the best of intentions by others <e> <s> i beg leave to wihdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords although there are no amendments tabled at this stage of the bill i feel that i must take this opportunity to re-emphasise the very genuine worries expressed by a number of noble lords in committee <e> <s> your lordships may remember that the noble earl lord perth who is held in high esteem when he speaks in this house was most uneasy about the possibility of asset stripping <e> <s> the noble lord lord tordoff speaking on behalf of the liberal democrats was even more concerned that the bill could be a charter for very lucrative asset stripping <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for his reassuring statement <e> <s> the four points which for reasons of time he decided not to reiterate give us as much reassurance as we could expect given our general disagreement over the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for piloting the bill through the house he knows that the measure is not popular on this side of the house <e> <s> we have grave doubts about whether it is the proper way to go about <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say a few words on the scottish attitude to the bill <e> <s> i notice that the noble lord lord sanderson who played a big part during the passage of the bill will wind up <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister referred to a statement made by the secretary of state for scotland in another place in which he emphasised that the primary objective of care in the community should be that of sustaining people in their homes for as long as possible <e> <s> recognising the great variations in individual circumstances will the minister ensure that the white paper will allow for the maximum flexibility in dealing with individual people in need of care <e> <s> can he also say when the promised white paper on the griffiths report will be published and whether there will be a separate white paper for scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords first i thank the minister for his usual helpful and courteous explanation of the bill <e> <s> at the outset perhaps i may register regret that this major bill on scottish education should be taken on a friday at almost the last gasp of the session <e> <s> i am sure that the minister has had representations from his scottish colleagues many of whom registered their displeasure at the last meeting of the scottish peers <e> <s> i regret to have to start in that way but it is important that we let the powers-that-be know that we consider that this should not be treated as a precedent for future scottish business <e> <s> having said that i should like to say a few words about the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords can i add to that and ask the minister whether he knows the schools that gave the opinion that they wanted to opt out <e> <s> how many of them were schools that were going to be closed <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that full explanation of these basically technical amendments <e> <s> in the maze of technicalities i tried to understand why the non-domestic water and sewerage charges were not being included in the transitional arrangements <e> <s> the minister gave a long explanation on that point <e> <s> i am sure that he will appreciate that the matter will require a fair amount of thought and study and perhaps a need to take advice <e>", "<cs> again i thank the minister for this very full explanation of a technical series of amendments <e> <s> i have only one point about which i should like to ask him though i may have got it wrong <e> <s> he suggested that there would be an exemption for those living at home who are following education similar to school education until the age of <e> <s> he will know that scotland has a very high non-residential population in higher education <e> <s> in particular glasgow and edinburgh have more that most other universities in britain and therefore they are affected considerably <e>", "<cs> i do not want to delay the committee for too long but i was perhaps wrong in suggesting that education similar to school courses is higher education <e> <s> students leave school and then go on to take exactly the same course as the minister will be aware in his area in a technical college but they are taking school subjects to top up their groups and are more likely to get a higher grade than perhaps they had at school <e> <s> these are the people i thought were going to be dealt with <e> <s> it is not a small number and is in fact a rather important number <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> it always amuses me when government ministers tell us that the wording of our amendments is not quite what is wanted <e> <s> i accept that we are not draftsmen but it amuses me that usually at a later stage in discussion of the legislation huge hefty lumps of amendments are put down to the amendments that the government proposed earlier <e> <s> i wonder how long we can continue to strive for perfection in the bill <e> <s> there have been a number of fairly lengthy amendments to the scottish poll tax legislation <e> <s> when that legislation left the chamber some two years ago we were assured that it was well nigh perfect <e> <s> it was legislation drawn up by the government who had all the necessary resources at their disposal <e>", "<cs> the committee will be grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for explaining so fully the new clause which all of us who are not legally trained are aware is highly technical <e> <s> we were able to follow the explanation to some extent but it would have been easier for myself and perhaps other noble lords if the noble and learned lord had been able togive us some examples of why or how the deficiency in the law was discovered <e> <s> when one sees in a new clause that changes to an order can be made without any local inquiry one is naturally a little concerned <e>", "<cs> we can accept this amendment <e> <s> indeed it is probably a change in our whole attitude to school education that we expect that people will stay on at school until they are young adults at least <e> <s> i think it is a nicer expression for that range of people and as the minister has said it covers school people of all ages from their early days until perhaps approaching <e> <s> i am grateful to him for that amendment <e>", "<cs> yes i thank the minister for his thoughtfulness <e> <s> i wonder whether if i had used the example of the borders instead of the highlands area that might have clinched the matter <e> <s> i am sure that in the areas which he knows so well the school is an important factor and something that <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord macaulay of bragar has widened the debate quite effectively <e> <s> it has made me even more confused as to whether the minister was meaning constraint or whether the word was put in merely as a stopgap <e> <s> the minister did not explain the matter fully <e> <s> if it is essential that the secretary of state should have these powers and that the standards and general requirements will be prescribed why is the word may included and not the word shall <e> <s> i know that we have had rich debates in the palace of westminster over the centuries regarding those two words <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to rise again but i wish to carry forward the metaphor <e> <s> i believe the minister has jumped the gun by speaking about selectivity <e> <s> i am not talking about that concerning this bill but this subsection <e> <s> standards and general requirements may be prescribed <e> <s> can the minister give me any example of where they will not be prescribed <e> <s> the matter started as a very small point and it has grown <e> <s> i do not wish to make too much of it <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for saying that he will reconsider the matter <e> <s> i did not expect this debate to continue for minutes <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> i am as always pleased when the noble earl lord selkirk joins the debate because he is so sharp and understanding <e> <s> this time he may be a little over-trusting <e> <s> we are dealing with a different animal <e> <s> we do not know what the boards may charge <e> <s> some people may not be keen on bagpipes at close quarters anyway and may be selective <e>", "<cs> we must be grateful to the minister for going so far <e> <s> i am taking the general feeling of the committee which is why the rush <e> <s> the schools have existed for a long time and a little longer will not matter <e> <s> my noble friend lady phillips commented on the scots being used as guinea pigs and she mentioned the poll tax <e> <s> there are many political reasons why it is easier to do something in scotland the government have less to lose than in other places <e>", "<cs> the ministers reply covered a great deal of ground <e> <s> he said that there was a difference of principle between us on the bill <e> <s> i know he will accept that what is perhaps an ideological difference between us on the principle of the bill is something quite divorced from our attitude that we must make the eventual measures work <e> <s> we were thinking in terms of the children and the amendment expresses our concern about the genuine possibility of these provisions not working <e>", "<cs> of course we accept that <e> <s> it could be said on the other hand that some schools are far too big <e> <s> i agree that they are <e> <s> i think that the minister knows our aims and has the best intentions <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not really sure that the minister has the purport of our amendments although he has given us an answer <e> <s> the first matter which we should try to clarify is that we are talking about special schools and not specialist schools <e> <s> i believe that perhaps the noble earl lord selkirk was thinking more of specialist schools for particular talents <e> <s> our amendments tend <e>", "<cs> the minister has given a helpful explanation <e> <s> however why does the school board need to see the register at all <e> <s> if the electoral reform society is to be involved why does it not receive the pleas from the different groups and send out the literature <e> <s> in some areas a relatively small group will know a good deal about what is happening <e> <s> human nature being what it is unless there is some way of impressing strongly on members of school boards the absolute necessity for confidentiality there may be difficulties <e>", "<cs> we have had a good discussion on the matter <e> <s> i think that much has been said in an attempt to be as helpful as possible <e> <s> i also think that the minister has got the point and that he is as concerned about the matter as the rest of us <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his explanation <e> <s> it appears that he has gone further than his noble friend lady carnegy and i expected <e> <s> i am sure he realises that it is important that we read his words with care <e> <s> however as a result of his comments i find it difficult to raise any objection and am happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> his answer was a particularly complicated one which requires examination <e> <s> on this side of the chamber we always give credit to the minister <e> <s> we know that his heart is in the right place and he is endeavouring to improve the bill as we are <e> <s> i detect a certain sympathy for the complexity of the problem <e> <s> we have never tried to pretend that it was not complex <e> <s> perhaps the minister would <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for recognising the importance of these two amendments and the subjects they deal with <e> <s> i also thank him for the extremely full way in which he replied <e> <s> he will appreciate that his reply was new to this side of the committee and so thorough and exhaustive that we will need to take some time examining it <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> he has again given a full explanation <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the minister has again been most helpful <e> <s> however i have one difficulty <e> <s> i have checked through the mountain of paperwork which i have received during the last few days and subject to correction i do not remember <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister and perhaps he could extend that offer to <e>", "<cs> the explanation given by the minister appears to meet the point <e> <s> i may be being obtuse here but i believe that the secretary of state will have the power to allow a school board to withdraw its proposals if the modifications which he has suggested are such that he considers that they change the nature of the original proposals put forward <e> <s> that is what i understand the minister said <e>", "<cs> i suggested at the outset that this matter could be the beginning of a bureaucratic nightmare <e> <s> i believe that we have a little evidence of that already <e> <s> the minister gave a very full explanation in his reply and he also said that he would take away the amendment and study it <e> <s> he added a word that was slightly disturbing to me when he said that the teacher may decide promptly to go one way or the other <e>", "<cs> the minister will be aware of the feeling in the chamber about the amendment <e> <s> the noble baroness lady carnegy will know that my name is attached to the amendment <e> <s> she will also be aware that we had a certain amount of success last week when dealing with our combined amendments <e> <s> we are not as successful today <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble baroness lady seear for her intervention from the english point of view <e> <s> she plainly said that the provision should perhaps have been contained in the english bill <e> <s> we should like it in the bill because we believe that the scottish people would like it to be in the bill <e>", "<cs> i must thank the noble earl for his introduction of these amendments <e> <s> i take great pleasure in congratulating him on his maiden speech in this chamber <e> <s> he has jumped into a tough bill <e> <s> we believe in scotland that it is an important seminal bill and we shall look at the necessarily complicated explanations that the noble earl has given of this large group of amendments <e> <s> that examination will have two results <e> <s> it will mean that we shall study the amendments with care and it will allow the noble earl to give another explanation when we return to the bill at a later stage <e> <s> so he may get two bites at his maiden speech <e> <s> we look forward to that and i hope that in the course of our discussions on scottish affairs we shall hear a great deal more from the noble earl <e>", "<cs> we must be grateful to the noble lord for his acceptance of the spirit of the amendment <e> <s> i must thank the noble <e>", "<cs> i was only too pleased to add my name to the amendment moved by the noble baroness lady carnegy of lour <e> <s> i should have moved it on her behalf when she was unwell last week if we had reached it <e> <s> many reasons have been given by her <e> <s> it seems self-evident that if a school decides to opt out there could be great repercussions for certain other schools in the area <e> <s> the noble baroness pointed out that a mixed school becoming a single sex school could seriously affect the composition of other schools <e> <s> a denominational school could either become non-denominational or could become specifically denominational and that could cause great difficulties <e>", "<cs> i understand that there are problems in the wording of such amendments but there are also problems in the wording of the ministers reply <e> <s> i am always in a difficulty when people talk of gifted children <e> <s> in doing so we are talking of special children who in any event would probably find it difficult to be in an average school <e> <s> i know of a school in glasgow towards which there has been a drift because of its high musical content <e> <s> other schools may have a particularly good department in a specific subject and there would be a drift towards that <e> <s> that is different from the school setting down its limits and <e>", "<cs> we are grateful to the minister for correcting what was obviously an oversight at the very least in the other place <e> <s> my noble friend lord howie of troon has a point <e> <s> many of us have been at both ends of a confrontation in another place <e> <s> we have listened to long speeches and possibly occasionally made long speeches usually there is another purpose behind them <e>", "<cs> i think that the minister has clarified the matters which caused the concern which triggered off the amendments <e> <s> i spoke rather longer than i intended and i am glad that i was vindicated since the minister realised the importance of the amendment and spoke in explanation for just as long <e>", "<cs> in what has been a pleasant day if such days can be pleasant i do not think that there is any doubt that that is about the poorest reply that we have so far had from the minister <e> <s> he said something that rather disturbed me <e> <s> he said that one does not expect schools to go back <e> <s> that may be fine but he almost suggested i shall look at his words with great care that at the end of the day the secretary of state would fund a school so that it would not go back <e> <s> he would not allow a school to go under <e> <s> i believe that those were his words i shall look at what he said with great care which seemed to me to pre-empt the matter <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that explanation <e> <s> in view of the timetable with which we are faced i do not suppose that there is any possibility of an explanation being given to parliament before the bill receives royal <e>", "<cs> i wish to oppose the motion that the clause stand part of the bill <e> <s> in other words i wish to oppose the government proposals for the revision of the curriculum and the assessment arrangements for scottish primary schools including the introduction of nationally standardised tests in english and mathematics at primary four and primary seven levels <e> <s> few people object to the main thrust of the proposal <e> <s> some form of measuring pupils progress is clearly desirable both to parents and teachers <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for the trouble that he has as always taken in his reply <e> <s> i am also grateful for the contributions of my noble friend lord macaulay and the noble lord lord addington <e> <s> i must comment on what the noble baroness lady carnegy said <e> <s> of course i am all for aptitude tests <e> <s> i believe that they can greatly help children <e> <s> one can decide that some children are mathematically blind and others blind in other ways <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the minister gave a firm qualification <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am slightly inclined to agree with the general tenor of what the minister has said <e> <s> that would mean that my original intention to move the motion that clause shall not stand part of the bill would be superfluous <e> <s> listening to what the minister said and trying to understand or interpret my own thoughts and my original intention make me think that i would rather look at the ministers answer before making a decision as to whether clause should stand part of the bill <e> <s> therefore at this stage i am grateful to the minister for his amendments <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> he will realise that as i was going to oppose the clause i shall need to consider very carefully what he has said and perhaps take advice on it <e> <s> however it appears that there is very little to separate the minister and i <e>", "<cs> i have one little point to make which is not unimportant in moving that clause do not stand part of the bill <e> <s> i hope the minister can clarify the statement that the secretary of state may make grants to persons <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that explanation <e> <s> i should have thought that the managers of educational establishments would have some training in this matter although i accept that frequently one has to go outside a particular discipline in order to look at it from the outside with an impartial and fresh outlook <e> <s> i can see the point of payments in that case <e> <s> however if the minister does not mind i shall take his reply away think it over and consider what would be the best thing to do on report <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> we all know that whether the sed is involved or not it is a spectre at any feast concerning wages and conditions <e> <s> the minister again seems to be hoping that what is being suggested here is the sort of thing that will happen <e> <s> obviously he cannot give a guarantee but he has given sufficient to enable me to consult the people who are particularly concerned on what is a tricky piece of negotiating machinery and trade union-government-local authority relationships and come back if necessary at report stage <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> <e> <s> the noble duke has put forward a reasonable case <e> <s> the noble baroness lady carnegy has illustrated a disturbing case and therefore the issue must be looked at <e> <s> i received this amendment only yesterday and am sure that the committee will realise that it is very important <e> <s> i have asked for advice but have received none <e> <s> at this point i am relying on the ministers answer <e> <s> when i receive that i shall consider that along with everything else that has been said in this debate <e> <s> i shall confer with people from all groups in my part of the west of scotland over the weekend and i hope to make a decision on this matter on <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his explanation particularly for the fact that the payments will be retrospective <e> <s> he gave a fairly reasonable explanation and has written to me <e> <s> i am grateful to him for his help <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that explanation <e> <s> all i should like to say is that we look forward to the revaluation of <e>", "<cs> my lords again i must thank the minister for his statement and for putting down this amendment <e> <s> one should not look a gift horse in the mouth but we discussed this very thoroughly during the passage of the scottish bill and it is a pity that it was not included then <e> <s> perhaps we could have saved some time both then and in respect of this bill <e> <s> late though it is we are grateful for the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for having listened so carefully as he always does to the arguments put forward in committee <e> <s> i thank him for his accommodation in the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i again thank the minister for having taken note of what was said in committee and of the general feeling in scotland <e> <s> we should be happier had there been an obligation on the board to publish more documents and to let the community know more about what it intends to do in respect of the new school <e> <s> i believe that we have gone as far as we can <e> <s> the minister has gone a long way towards satisfying some of our concerns <e> <s> again we welcome the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for taking so much trouble to reply <e> <s> i am also grateful for the fact that he has built in a number of safeguards and has conceded the question of the two ballots <e> <s> it seems to me the the expression of the minister of state in his letter to the eis raises a number of very serious <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the minister has given his interpretation which is possibly correct <e> <s> if the minister had been willing at least to take away this amendment and redraft it as we had intended to draft it because we do not have the expertise which parliamentary draftsmen have that would perhaps have made a difference <e> <s> however even with its flaws which are not desperately serious i still wish to pursue the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords we all have in mind the wonders of various secretaries of state but i am sure that the noble lord lord grimond who has been in parliament for a long <e>", "<cs> my lords this is another way of trying to express general anxiety over the question of the role of the number of parents voting <e> <s> although i am sure that the minister will probably have something to say about the actual wording of the amendment i am totally in favour of the spirit which lies behind it <e> <s> we all know what that spirit is <e> <s> however whether it is possible to place this in a bill is perhaps another matter <e> <s> but if the noble earl wished to press the matter further i should certainly support him <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble earl was speaking t amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i think that was the grouping which was advised <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that that makes me wonder why these two amendments were originally grouped together <e> <s> this has rather put us off <e> <s> however i certainly see the point and i am pleased with what the minister said <e> <s> moreover i hope that the noble earl lord perth will feel the same <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am grateful to the minister for having agreed to this point in committee and for having found a way to express it in the amendments which we support <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness lady carnegy and my noble friend for giving some backing to the amendment <e> <s> considered together with the seriousness with which the minister viewed the matter that suggests that we have touched upon something rather important <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will realise that i have to say that i am disappointed <e> <s> i know that there can be unfairness in such a matter as this <e> <s> i take the point that the noble baroness made about rural areas such as the western isles and people wishing to move <e> <s> so far as i know the amendment is not motivated by strathclyde although it may be the area with the greatest need as it has the most schools <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the minister and to other noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> i said that i would conduct some consultation <e> <s> i have not had the facilities of the minister to do that <e> <s> therefore my observations are based more on a discussion with people <e> <s> however i am sure that the noble duke is aware that in the west of scotland it is easy to get a cross-section of opinion on this matter particularly as i have been in the political world for a long time and therefore have a broad spread of acquaintances and close friends in all communities <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble baroness for having raised this matter because it is causing considerable concern in scotland <e> <s> has the minister or the department given serious thought to the control or perhaps even the prohibition of industrial fishing in those waters which many people believe is part of the problem <e> <s> i am grateful that the minister was able to say that there had been implementation of the proposal made by his honourable friend in another place on th april about the control of fishing in scottish inshore waters <e> <s> he said that the measure had been introduced on st july <e> <s> can he give us any indication of the progress that has been made on this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for acceding to the request of the noble earl lord perth and also the arguments from this side of the house <e> <s> in a strange way i believe that the removal of simple makes it more flexible for the secretary of state to make his ultimate decision <e> <s> in fact a simple majority would have been more specific than merely a majority <e> <s> i am grateful to him for his co-operation <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a long and detailed argument about the question of majority <e> <s> there is nothing wrong in that because it is a big decision for scottish education <e> <s> we believe that in certain areas the opting out of only a small number of schools could have a serious effect on the rest of the schools in the neighbourhood <e>", "<cs> my lords i again thank the minister for the courteous way in which he has dealt with all our amendments <e> <s> i associate myself and this side of the house with what he said about the number of people who have taken part in the debates on the bill <e> <s> i am particularly grateful to my noble friend lord macaulay who has borne a great deal of the weight of this bill <e> <s> i take this opportunity of thanking him for that <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to ask the noble viscount <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i could first apologise to the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe for jumping up too quickly <e> <s> the minister referred to the bellgrove accident <e> <s> i have not yet had an opportunity to see the report but i hope that the minister will convey to the secretary of state that part of the worry in scotland is a belief that the accident may have been caused because of the singling of the line and the lack of adequate signalling <e> <s> the difficulty for scottish people is that it seems to be part of british rails policy to continue with this singling of certain lines believing that the signalling can be improved <e> <s> there is a very heavily used part of the line on the outskirts of glasgow at milngavie where they are talking of doing the same thing <e> <s> i merely want to register that i hope a lesson will be taken from the accident at bellgrove <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for his courtesy in reading the statement to the house and for making sure that the staff will be looked after in the new set-up <e> <s> i am sure that they will be grateful for the assurances <e> <s> there are many questions to be asked some of which have been asked in regard to the earlier statement <e> <s> one or two questions apply specifically to scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole house will agree that this is a difficult problem and that everyone is looking for a solution <e> <s> i am pleased that the minister has been in close touch with the scottish fishermens federation <e> <s> has he given thought to the federations suggestion concerning the type of gear carried on fishing boats which if illegally used can frustrate any progress on net size <e> <s> has he considered the federations suggestion that there should be only one net per boat <e> <s> is he aware that industrial fishing vessels using small nets frequently collect immature fish <e> <s> is he sure that the by-catch of per cent <e> <s> is enforced rigidly and is it not perhaps too high <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl will be aware that there was no discussion at report of the bill largely because we had no representatives of his church here <e> <s> i am most grateful to him for the brief but interesting history that he has given of his church in scotland <e> <s> i come from the other side of the country <e> <s> i am not religious <e> <s> nevertheless i was very conscious of killiecrankie in scottish history and such matters as the silver bullet <e> <s> to call king william of orange a usurper may be all right down here in parts of scotland it is not a phrase that would most readily come to the lips <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there is still great uneasiness about the system <e> <s> as the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has said there have been occasions when there have been difficulties <e> <s> i witnessed one myself in which a childs pushchair was jammed in one of the two outlets at a tube station <e> <s> at the other outlet there was a queue of impatient people <e> <s> there was no member of staff in sight <e> <s> there was no panic on that occasion but there could easily have been panic <e> <s> is the minister aware that this is a matter about which the public feel uneasy and to which lrt should pay particular attention <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the points that the noble lord lord tordoff particularly mentioned was that there was little interest in transport debates <e> <s> that fact always amazes me because there is enormous interest in specific transport problems <e> <s> everyone is interested in those as anyone in the department of transport will acknowledge <e> <s> the department knows that from the large number of letters it receives on the subject <e> <s> members are continually harassed by constituents on transport matters <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will be aware that more than per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i take it from the necessarily complicated explanation that the noble viscount gave that this licence will now be valid in other countries in europe and one will not require to get a translation when one goes abroad <e> <s> it is extremely complicated <e> <s> perhaps it has to be but it is describing something with which we are all basically familiar <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly not keep the house from the ministers reply for more than a few minutes <e> <s> i was always told that the one subject on which one should not speak unless one knew about it was agriculture <e> <s> having listened to the two contributions in the debate i am fully convinced by that advice <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the agreed need to keep the quotas within the limits of scientific advice we all accept <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord underhill has a heavy cold and he is sorry that he is unable to be here today <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mountevans said it is hardly a transport debate without the presence of my noble friend <e> <s> knowing him extremely well i am sure that he will read every word of what is said today and he will no doubt raise these matters in a future debate <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will be aware that this administrative nightmare will come south of the border this year <e> <s> he may then find a great many objections from his side of the house <e> <s> does he realise that many people have a genuine difficulty with the poll tax <e> <s> under the old rating system per cent <e> <s> rebates were available for those on low incomes <e> <s> that figure has now been reduced to per cent <e> <s> each person over will have to pay per cent <e> <s> of perhaps or <e> <s> that is a severe blow to those who are in receipt of inadequate incomes and is especially hard on old people <e> <s> the government would greatly reduce the problem if they could reinstate for that category the per cent <e> <s> rebate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure other noble lords will have experienced speaking late on the second reading of a bill having ticked off all the points made by a large number of earlier speakers <e> <s> imagine the situation now when not only is that the case but also when the points have been made by some of the best legal brains in scotland <e> <s> that makes my task even more difficult <e> <s> i have no intention of trying to repeat in my own words those of such able advocates <e>", "<cs> we are all grateful to a certain extent to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for his reply but there is a feeling that he has for some reason or another failed to grasp the nettle <e> <s> why is it that in england the charity commissioners are required to keep that register whereas he has suggested that in scotland local author ties might do that <e> <s> that puzzles me <e> <s> will the local authorities have power to demand from the inland revenue lists of all the charities in scotland <e> <s> the noble and learned lord then went on to speak of the scvo perhaps doing that job <e> <s> as an outside non-statutory body would it have power to ask the inland revenue to supply the information <e>", "<cs> i wish to ask the noble and learned lord a simple question <e> <s> it has been suggested that one should be able to understand what is meant by the bill by reading it and also the penalties involved <e> <s> however i think i shall not be alone in not knowing exactly what level is <e> <s> i know the principle behind it but for my own sake and perhaps for the sake of one or two other members of the committee i hope the noble and learned lord the lord advocate will tell us where we can find reference to the different levels <e> <s> perhaps he could also say when they are changed whether it is in line with inflation or for some other reason <e> <s> it is a simple point but it causes some confusion <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount accept that we on this side of the houseor perhaps i should say the whole house realise that there are great difficulties and problems about this matter particularly when the estimates are considered <e> <s> it costs something like million more to drive a tunnel compared with building a cut bypass <e> <s> does he agree with evidence from newspapers and other sources of a strong feeling that rightly or wrongly there has not been the co-operation between the department of transport and the department of the environment that he suggested <e> <s> if there is disagreement is it not the <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether the legislation which he says will apply in will be retrospective in scotland and if not why not <e>", "<cs> my name is down to this amendment and to amendment no <e> <s> and i should like to associate myself with the amendment of the noble and learned lord lord morton of shuna <e> <s> this amendment is taken almost word for word from clause b of the courts and legal services bill for england and wales which is before parliament <e> <s> it will ensure that the secretary of state must bear in mind the desirability of balancing the interests of conveyancing service providers and those of the consumers of those services <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for the trouble he has taken in his detailed explanation in view of the brief explanation on the order paper <e> <s> when one picks up the draft instruments they tend to be rather complicated without the assistance of the parent <e>", "<cs> my lords i again thank the minister for his explanation and agree that it would be better to take the motions <e>", "<cs> i am disappointed that the minister has not offered at least to take away the amendment to consider it <e> <s> i do not know what extra burden would be placed on the licensing authority <e> <s> i am sure that licensing authorities receive information about premises from chief constables and others in the district <e> <s> i know of a number of off-licences i am sure that there must be many even in the east of scotland which are inadequate for the purpose <e> <s> they are sometimes run by families and quite frequently young people may be selling at the counter <e> <s> there should be some control <e> <s> i shall withdraw the amendment but i may bring it back at report stage after taking more advice <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make a point to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e> <s> he mentioned the increase in drunkenness and the cause suggested by the surveys <e> <s> however what was the breakdown <e> <s> i have seen figures in some surveys about which i was not happy <e> <s> how do we know when someone is bouncing around the street <e> <s> incidentally i am not sure whether access to alcohol because of the outlets has caused the increase in drunkenness which is reported or whether as many experts believe it is caused by the price being lower than before <e> <s> most people concerned about alcoholism are convinced that price has more to do with it than the availability of the outlets <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord the lord advocate said that he had aligned the opening hours of off-licences with those of pubs and hotels <e> <s> if he has i shall be delighted but i do not believe that he meant to say that <e> <s> secondly i do not see how the provision would affect the view held by the noble earl lord selkirk because people could obtain goods from the off-licence and go home for lunch together <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e> <s> i am informed that some licensing boards accept the local licensed trade association as a competent objector while others do not <e> <s> part of the purpose of the amendment was to achieve uniformity or clarity <e> <s> i shall be only too pleased to discuss the matter with the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> there was an error in the material that i had <e> <s> however i am very pleased with the response of the minister <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the clause as framed by the government does not take account of the purchasing of licensed premises <e> <s> when the transaction is settled the purchaser acquires from the sale the title of the premises <e> <s> until that has gone through a licensing court although he has the title to the premises it does not necessarily mean that he has the title to the licence <e> <s> it is of little value merely to own the premises and not the licence <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the lord advocate suggests that there has been wide consultation <e> <s> i am not particularly close to the licensed trade but the general feeling i have is that there is unfairness in having no appeal <e> <s> however i shall read what the minister said and perhaps discuss the matter with him and come back later <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say a word <e> <s> i do not think that the noble lord lord lucas should be surprised that i withdraw the amendment <e> <s> we had made that arrangement <e> <s> we accepted that his amendment was very interesting and one that should be considered <e> <s> my noble friend lord macaulay said that jimmy hoods bill was under pressure and any amendment of it would have lost the whole bill <e> <s> we therefore believed that the amendment that was put down was interesting <e> <s> time has moved on and new evidence has come to light about whether there should be special outlets for the sale of alcohol in large shops <e> <s> i am surprised that the noble lord does not remember the discussion that we had last week <e>", "<cs> i can see the problem <e> <s> there is also a problem in the definition of what a bar is <e> <s> we all know what is meant by a little cocktail bar some get bigger but do not quite reach the public bar standard <e> <s> i am sure we shall return to this at some point perhaps not in this bill but fairly soon however i thank the minister for his reply and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will be aware that the secretary of state for scotland spoke recently of the prime minister falling into line with his better judgment on the poll tax <e> <s> can the noble lord advise the house on any further improvements the secretary of state for scotland will suggest to the prime minister <e> <s> for instance can the minister confirm whether his right honourable friend will advise her to introduce per cent <e> <s> rebates for the people in scotland who live on income support and suffer real hardship <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the house will be grateful to the minister for having gone through the bill and explained its purpose <e> <s> we on this side of the house give our general support to the bill especially as it carries out international conventions and protocols <e> <s> however as no doubt the minister expects there are several matters which we shall wish to raise more fully in committee <e>", "<cs> it should be the other way round but i am afraid that it is not because the under-secretary of state also happens by sheer chance to be the appointed chairman of the conservative party in scotland a position which yields a certain amount of power <e> <s> that is important and it is no use pretending that it is not so <e> <s> the scottish press of all shades of opinion is full of it <e> <s> when we were in office we as a party never behaved that way <e> <s> we were never as partisan as that <e> <s> if a future labour government behaved that way i should be greatly disappointed <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for her explanation <e> <s> i was aware of the points that she made about what was contained in schedule to the bill <e> <s> i tabled the amendment to emphasise the great unease felt in scotland about the way in which appointments have been made <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the minister for that concession <e> <s> i look forward to seeing his amendment <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i always thought that the name was capercailzie but i may be wrong about todays spelling <e> <s> i look forward to reading the report that lord james douglas-hamilton in the other place will produce <e> <s> from what i have discovered in the past few days it appears that there are four or five possible reasons for the reduction in numbers of this bird <e> <s> it seems to be overwhelmingly the case that shooting is the biggest single factor <e> <s> it is one that we can do most about immediately <e> <s> will the minister urge his friends to follow the ban introduced by the forestry commission in <e> <s> if so does he agree that there may immediately be an improvement in the population figures of the capercailzie <e>", "<cs> the minister mentioned two amendments standing in my name <e> <s> i was pleased with the explanation that he gave <e> <s> he has gone a little further than his honourable friend went in committee in another place but he still has not gone quite far enough in terms of the representation of a member of the teaching staff on the board of the hospital as a non-executive director <e> <s> the minister has given us all kinds of assurances on this matter <e> <s> i take his word for it that one of the teaching staff will always be a non-executive director <e> <s> however the minister will be aware that his word is not binding <e>", "<cs> in supporting this group of amendments i do not think i can do as well as the noble lord who has just spoken <e> <s> on going through the amendments i should like to emphasis to the minister the difference in the scottish amendment <e> <s> after all in the bill we are not starting new legislation but amending an existing scottish act the act <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> ka refers to the schedule and i should like to stress that that would be included in the same group for the same reasons <e> <s> i am very glad to be able to say that one of the good things about the health service is that national agreements have given us relatively good stability in the service and i hope that that continues <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the minister for his very explicit reply and also for his promise to send me a copy of the paper he mentioned <e> <s> it will be churlish of me at this time of night and also on the occasion of his birthday to take the matter further <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my name is associated with amendment no <e> <s> a which as the noble and learned lord lord morton of shuna said is very closely related to his amendment <e> <s> the information i have on the subject is in a way quite plaintive <e> <s> it comes mainly from scottish womens aid which is extremely concerned about the matter <e> <s> it does not disagree with the reduction in the time <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his statement <e> <s> he has given an assurance that the matter is being dealt with and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am again grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his amendment <e> <s> i take his word that it covers all the points that were raised in amendment no <e> <s> d <e> <s> because it is a complicated and rather important amendment perhaps he will accept that although my noble friend and i do not move that amendment we shall wish to take advice at report stage <e> <s> i am happy that he has tried to accommodate us <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his reply and perhaps i may correct some statements which i made <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord morton of shuna was in the same trap of referring to spouses as if they were women only whereas a spouse is either party to the marriage <e>", "<cs> with that advice and the promise of more information i have little option but to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think i knew the argument that the minister would put forward before he rose <e> <s> i wanted some way in which people who were looking for accommodation would know what reasonable rents were in the area <e> <s> the rent officers and the local authorities with their much greater powers can find out what rents are in an area <e> <s> i know of many people who have secured accommodation and spent money on it only to discover later that they were unable to have the full rent from the dhss <e> <s> they were paying rather more and enough to make life difficult <e> <s> however they were not paying sufficient to decide to look for <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for that information <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i sympathise with the minister <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord lord mackie of benshie is wearing his farmers hat and chewing straw <e> <s> i am sure that he recognises that the travelling people have been a boon to farmers in parts of scotland for over years <e> <s> they may be thorns as well but they are also a boon <e>", "<cs> we learn something every day <e> <s> this is not an easy problem <e> <s> these people have been used to generations of nomadic living <e> <s> as an aside every time i am in the area i take my friends to the dunoon road at the road end of hells glen to show them the heart of argyll where traditionally travelling people were married <e> <s> i see the noble lord lord stodart nodding <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i thank my noble friend lord underhill for raising this matter today <e> <s> this is a very timely debate and there was considerable surprise that so many noble lords wished to speak in the debate <e> <s> i was particularly pleased at the very wide representation of people from outside the south east of england <e> <s> noble lords have spoken from the north west and the centre of england yorkshire scotland and of course there was the contribution of the noble lord lord blease from ireland <e> <s> those speeches were a timely reminder of the fact that whatever were the previous attitudes towards the channel tunnel we are now very much aware that it will be with us in the very near future <e>", "<cs> the minister always tries to be as helpful as his powers allow <e> <s> i look forward to hearing his reply as to whether the provision is in the appropriate place in the bill <e> <s> again like my noble friend lord taylor of gryfe i am pleased that the minister included all disabilities <e> <s> the minister made a complicated reply for which i am grateful <e> <s> i look forward to hearing his comments when we return at a later stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am only too willing to accept that it is very difficult to try to check on nursing and residential homes <e> <s> however i am anxious that we should all become aware that there are undoubtedly nursing and residential homes which are to say the least dubious <e> <s> that is particularly the case as regards private homes not those run by voluntary organisations <e> <s> i know a number of homes in the argyll area which are extremely expensive and conditions are not very good <e> <s> on the other hand i know of others run by voluntary organisations for example the church of scotland which are extremely good <e> <s> in fact they are excellent <e>", "<cs> i accept that this is a consolidation measure <e> <s> the only point i make is that if there is overcrowding in local authority establishments a problem arises for the secretary of state <e> <s> perhaps the secretary of state has used his powers so sparingly because he is aware of that difficulty <e>", "<cs> in opposing this clause i am probing the governments intentions <e> <s> the clause as it stands provides no duty to provide accommodation in certain circumstances <e> <s> in fact if the person concerned meets the criteria which involve having been resident in certain defined <e>", "<cs> after listening to the noble lords answer i am even more certain that i was correct in opposing the motion <e> <s> he has shown that it was necessary to oppose the motion in order to raise points about which he himself was in doubt <e> <s> as he said his answer was very complicated <e> <s> i shall certainly look at it and take advice <e>", "<cs> my lords political unification of the centres and technical advances are very important <e> <s> however should not the immediate step even perhaps the long-term step be improved conditions under which air traffic controllers work <e> <s> anyone who has visited a control tower will realise that the pressures are incredible <e> <s> is not the best and quickest solution to have more fully trained controllers <e>", "<cs> the government will realise that they have grouped this amendment with amendments nos <e> <s> aw and ax <e> <s> we were quite happy about that <e> <s> the amendments refer specifically to scotland <e> <s> the minister will see that amendment no <e> <s> aw proposes to omit in line the words <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to be marginally less enthusiastic than perhaps the minister had hoped after he has gone to so much trouble <e> <s> i must stress that i welcome his attempts as far as they go <e> <s> however they are limited in their scope of representation <e> <s> it is not clear for instance whether an individuals assessment of needs is covered by the measure <e> <s> it appears to be activated only after the individual has either been provided with a service in terms of the proposed new section ba or has been refused a service <e> <s> i believe it would be better if the measure included representation prior to the granting or refusing of a service <e> <s> that might avoid that procedure <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the committee <e> <s> this is not my amendment <e> <s> i thought that my suggestions were rather better than the governments suggestions and that is why i attempted to move the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not want to be churlish <e> <s> i agree that the minister has gone a very long way and listened to many of the representations that have been made <e> <s> there are still some problems which may be resolved with experience <e> <s> one of my worries was that the local authority could be judge and jury which is always dangerous but that may perhaps be straightened out when the legislation has been in operation for a period <e> <s> if the local authority still has some independence there may be other ways of tackling that particular problem <e> <s> despite what i have said i am grateful to the minister for the efforts he has made <e>", "<cs> the minister gave a long reply <e> <s> i had the impression that he attempted to meet the spirit of the amendments although as is usually the case the wording from outside the government is never quite right <e> <s> he has given me a great deal to think about <e> <s> i shall take the amendment away with the greatest of goodwill <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the minister for his very helpful reply <e> <s> he has met all of the points except that raised by the noble baroness just now <e> <s> we always wonder what the powers are and how the ordinary citizen is able to stir up those reserve powers <e> <s> i shall study the reply <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that very full reply <e> <s> however i am sure he will realise that i and others will need to study it with care <e> <s> it is always interesting when what one assumes to be a fairly simple and straightforward amendment which will be of benefit to everyone turns out to be a matter of great puzzlement <e> <s> nevertheless i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> of course i shall study what the minister said and i hope that he also will do me the courtesy of looking closely at my amendment proposing the new clause <e> <s> obviously my wording is more likely to be flawed than a provision drawn up by the ministers experts but even in the noble lords explanation he kept emphasising what the white paper said <e> <s> all things being equal we take the provisions at their face value but at the end of the day what worries us is that the provision could be challenged <e>", "<cs> i accept the noble lords words and will examine them with great care <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for her comments <e> <s> when i introduced this amendment i linked it up with amendment no <e> <s> aba <e> <s> i should stress that the latter amendment is linked with this amendment <e> <s> we believe that the bill as it stands goes further down the road of promoting vague enabling powers which concentrate powers in the hands of the secretary of state without much chance of parliamentary review <e> <s> the director of the kings fund feels that that will be the case <e> <s> i am sure the minister is well aware of that body <e> <s> the two amendments seem to me to address a good point <e> <s> like the noble baroness i am anxious to hear the ministers reply <e>", "<cs> again i am grateful to the noble baroness lady carnegy of lour for her questions <e> <s> i had been convinced that the minister was correct until the noble baroness raised that point <e> <s> i do not for a moment suggest that he was wrong but perhaps it is a matter of interpretation <e> <s> our amendments originated largely with the law society <e> <s> i shall withdraw the amendment but i hope that the minister will accept that we may bring it back at a later date <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> in clause the bill gives draconian new powers to the secretary of state <e> <s> in the past one of the greatest obstacles to the development of high quality community care in scotland has been the failure of the scottish office to use the power of guidance which it already has <e> <s> it could have used that power to guide social work and community care in scotland much better than it has <e> <s> for example there are no national guidelines in existence for the registration of day care establishments <e> <s> that means that local authorities work in a vacuum trying to set their own standards for such establishments <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful that the minister will look south of the border <e> <s> having been very active in many ways during the passage of the social work scotland act i firmly believe that we set a standard which was copied or was attempted to be copied down south <e> <s> but as always happens people leap ahead <e> <s> the more one looks around the world and in particular at our own country of britain the more one realises that there is never one group which makes smooth progress all the time <e>", "<cs> the minister gave a most helpful reply <e> <s> i was pleased that he realised that the points i raised are causing considerable anxiety in certain areas in scotland <e> <s> i shall take care in reading his reply and obtaining advice <e> <s> bearing in mind that his was the nicest and most innocuous description of the treasury i have heard i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all delighted to hear of new inward investment in scotland <e> <s> the announcement today concerning motorola is particularly welcome <e> <s> however can the minister give us any indication of the number of jobs that have been created as opposed to those that have been promised by the scottish office and certainly in the newspapers <e> <s> i understand that over the past five years the number of jobs that have been created has never reached more than per cent <e> <s> of those that were promised <e> <s> will the minister comment on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall look at the ministers reply but there must surely be occasions on which the police have objected to licences even after they have been granted <e> <s> it is obvious that there is a great deal of drinking immediately outside licensed premises in the street <e> <s> i do not frequent them very often particularly at these times but i should be surprised if some of the people drinking outside did not move in and out of the premises <e> <s> however i shall look at the ministers reply and perhaps raise the subject again at a later stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that the late lord ross of marnock passed the act with i think great foresight <e> <s> i was involved in it <e> <s> i am only too glad to admit that he had to make that amendment in order to get the act through <e> <s> however i cannot agree with the ministers last statement namely that they try to be even-handed <e> <s> we now have a change in that off-licences will be able to open <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister again referred to the survey <e> <s> i suggest that attitudes have changed considerably since then <e> <s> the new conditions have not applied for all that long but the whole atmosphere particularly in a city like glasgow this year and in the year of the glasgow festival has made people see matters differently <e> <s> that is why i appeal to the minister and the secretary of state to consider whether another survey would do any harm <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the minister realises that that is a disappointing reply <e> <s> in many cases not only will it depend on whether the board is the same all day which is one of the hazards a licensee has to overcome but it may also depend on the initials of his name as to whether he is heard in the morning or the afternoon and the type of board and who is sitting <e> <s> i believe that it is against natural justice as has been pointed out by the licensees <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister rises to reply i confess that i do not know what is the definition of a club <e> <s> with the noble and learned lord the lord advocate perhaps the minister could find out for me <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble baroness will forgive my intervention <e> <s> i am assuming for the sake of accuracy and perhaps she will confirm it that she means political with a small p and not a large p <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had an extremely interesting and long debate <e> <s> inevitably there was a little repetitiveness <e> <s> i make no excuse for having raised this matter on behalf of myself and particularly my noble friend lord underbill <e> <s> on his behalf i should like to thank all noble lords who have expressed their good wishes for his speedy recovery <e> <s> i shall certainly convey their kind words to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i referred to the facilities for -tonne berths <e> <s> i cannot foresee such berths being built other than for coal <e> <s> i do not refer to the other facilities <e> <s> i believe that three berths will be built <e> <s> it is because of the struggles that the mining industry has had that there has been this great disturbance <e> <s> it is doing well <e> <s> we believe that that success could be taken away because of a particularly advantageous balance of currency between a foreign country and ourselves <e> <s> over a period of five years the mining industry could be even more disadvantaged <e> <s> that is why we have raised the issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall read the statement with great care <e> <s> i did not have that impression <e> <s> i have always had great respect for the noble lord since we met in committee in about <e> <s> i thought that i had in part an ally regarding <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all aware of the great knowledge of the noble viscount lord thurso with regard to the habits catching by both net and rod and processing of salmon <e> <s> those of us who were involved in the act it gave me a shock to realise that it was as far back as that realise that his knowledge of salmon was a great contribution to our proceedings in the house <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government still involved in the development of the lean burn engine as well as the catalytic converter <e> <s> the minister will be aware that perhaps the best way of reducing emissions of carbon dioxide from internal combustion engines is a combination of the two <e> <s> have the government made any effort to discuss with governments of other countries ways of encouraging the production of smaller cars <e> <s> one feels that large cars which mostly carry single individuals must be wasteful <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will know better than i just how big a problem this is <e> <s> we do not even know what is happening as regards seal predation of sandeels <e> <s> the effects of that are unknown as are the effects of sea warming which are still being investigated <e> <s> it is difficult even to estimate the sandeel population <e> <s> that is why i was rather surprised to discover that there was no guarantee that the boats that are licensed to fish for sandeels they are having their licences ended soon would not be able to increase their fishing intensity in the early part of the season <e> <s> no restriction was put on the fishing effort or the total catch <e> <s> given all the problems will the minister take into account some of the points that i and the noble baroness have made and use them as a guide to licensing in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords we are in agreement that the bill is progressive <e> <s> it repeals a act <e> <s> therefore we can all have faith in the idea of progress <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will be aware that the point raised by the noble baroness and sir leon brittan on the allocation of slots to independent airlines is rather important <e> <s> can the noble viscount say what support the government are likely to be giving to small independent airlines which have a very big part to play in regional development <e> <s> can he also say whether the government expect that when stansted comes on stream it will be easier for and encouragement will be given to small independent airlines to obtain slots in the south east of britain <e>", "<cs> my lords i did say that it might be for the convenience of your lordships to <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that very full explanation <e> <s> i take issue with him when he tries to suggest that there were only isolated incidents of abuse although i do not have any figures on that <e> <s> perhaps the minister could obtain information on that from his sources in order to discover how serious is that situation <e> <s> like the noble lord lord mottistone i do not suggest that the wording of the amendment is perfect <e> <s> however if the minister discovers that there are significant numbers of cases of abuse he will then decide that a need exists <e> <s> he will then be able to test <e>", "<cs> my lords after the introduction by the noble lord lord brougham and vaux and the remarks of the noble lord lord tordoff there is little that i should like to say <e> <s> the bill is useful and we are all grateful for its introduction by mr brandon-bravo in the other place <e> <s> we are however concerned that it should not affect the horne report in any way and should not be used as a stopgap <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for writing to me and for enclosing a copy of his amendment <e> <s> at this time of night when he and i have been waiting here for so long to deal with the amendments relating to scotland i feel a wee bit like timpani drums in a symphony orchestra two notes at the end of the movement <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords while i accept the good will and good intentions of the minister he must be aware that in scotland there is a fair amount of unease about the apparent secrecy of health boards plans concerning almost everything that they undertake <e> <s> as the minister will be aware that unease is particularly great in parts of the west of scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an advantage as we are always a little worried when this government produce glossy documents <e> <s> having said that and having taken on board what the minister has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we should all be grateful to the noble lord lord tordoff for raising this matter today and for the report in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the support for the amendment from the noble baronesses lady faithfull and lady masham both of whom have a great deal of experience in this field <e> <s> in particular the noble baroness lady faithfull as she put it has been both an inspector and inspected <e> <s> that is quite a record <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an important point <e> <s> perhaps we shall have an even stronger inspectorate but under a different name <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in his reply the minister said that he was advised on certain matters and possibly because he is in the same position as myself we are getting into fairly deep water <e> <s> for example he did not refer to this i wonder whether the court decision which i cited had been taken into account in the framing of clause <e>", "<cs> my lords that is part of the worry <e> <s> there may be more money but it may not be new money <e> <s> however the noble lord said that we could discuss this matter for the rest of the evening but realising what lies ahead there is not much of the evening left <e> <s> i shall take advice on the complicated reply that the minister has given <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the minister for his detailed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for giving way <e> <s> can he give some indication by the time we reach committee stage of the kind of figures that the chairman of the companies are looking for <e> <s> i understand that they are looking for anything between per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> more than the government have given them <e> <s> can the minister give any idea of what the government believe they will need <e>", "<cs> my lords there is also the argument that if the police conducted random breath tests at controlled centres the public would probably appreciate the job that they were doing <e> <s> i congratulate the government on the work that they are doing it is a continuous and difficult job <e> <s> will the government give serious consideration to the european limit <e> <s> in most other countries in europe it is below our limit <e> <s> i believe that the commission wishes us to set a limit below the millimetre level <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the house will be pleased with the exhaustive statement that the noble baroness has made <e> <s> however the noble baroness lady burton raised in her question an important point about denied boarding compensation to which i hope the government will pay attention <e> <s> i believe that the noble baroness spoke in general terms about denied boarding compensation with regard to regular passengers <e> <s> i hope that the government will consider not only passengers on scheduled flights but those on chartered flights who are unable to board a plane because it is overbooked <e> <s> for such passengers the situation may be even more serious when it affects their fortnights holiday than for those regular travellers who can always catch the next scheduled flight <e>", "<cs> my lords the ministers reply is rather surprising <e> <s> he must know that something like million additional passengers will be using lines in kent which are among the most congested in the world <e> <s> many commuters are bound to be forced on to what are already inadequate roads in trying to reach their destinations by car <e> <s> have the government fully explored the statement by the european commissioner on th june that there could be financial assistance from the commission for a rail link if the uk government applied for it <e> <s> does he not think that a link will be ultimately required <e> <s> would it not be a good idea to pursue the possibility of outside finance from europe and to get started on a link that will ultimately be essential <e>", "<cs> my lords i merely want to say that the scottish amendment is almost identical to that moved by my noble friend lord pitt of hampstead and i give my full support to his amendment <e> <s> we have received representations from the british medical association and others in scotland <e> <s> i hope that the government will see their way to accepting the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i have great pleasure in supporting the amendment which i hope is uncontroversial <e> <s> in my view it attempts to tidy up the scottish provisions for university membership of the health boards to bring the position more in line with that in england and wales <e> <s> as the noble baroness said an amendment for england and wales moved by the noble baroness lady young at report stage was accepted <e> <s> i hope that the government will accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister referred to regulations and i have no doubt that britain strictly adheres to them but they are the minimum regulations <e> <s> is the noble viscount aware that pacific nuclear transport a subsidiary of british nuclear fuels operates six pacific class custom built ships to transport its radioactive material <e> <s> the vessels are specially built with double skins and with special bulkheads <e> <s> however those ships are not plying on one of the worlds busiest if not the busiest sea lanes the dover-calais sea lane <e> <s> why does bnf use these special ships into their own ports in cumbria whereas they allow the flasks to be transported across the channel on ordinary ferries sometimes with other cargo <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord allen for drawing the attention of the house to the work of the sub-committee <e> <s> i assume that it will receive evidence from numast which is much concerned about some of the proposals but welcomes many of them <e> <s> it is especially concerned that we should maintain a british merchant fleet and that we should learn the lessons of mixed fleets from the disaster of the scandinavian star <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we all accept the fact that this is a safety measure <e> <s> however can the minister say whether any attention has been paid to the fact that many of these lights appear at least to me to be far too intense and that they can be rather disturbing to some people <e> <s> moreover although i am taking the matter a little further than the issue of rear-end collisions can he say whether anything has transpired from the experiment with road marking to keep vehicles a decent distance apart <e> <s> i believe that there is an experimental stretch of road which is being used for this purpose <e> <s> i appreciate the fact that this is slightly wide of the question on the order paper but it is aimed at the same basic effort to stop rear-end collisions <e>", "<cs> the minister jumped up rather early spurred on i think by the breadth extent and perhaps the weight of the <e>", "<cs> i do not want to denigrate scottish employers but i do not believe there are all that many scottish employers whose efforts in regard to training is something they can be proud of <e> <s> one or two employers traditionally have a wonderful record but we need people from some of the colleges of education and the training schools <e> <s> those are the people we need with genuine experience of these matters <e> <s> it is by no means confined to employers <e> <s> one of our concerns is that the employers on the board will be looking for people to do the work that is required next week and not next year or years from now

the schedule it may not be quite so difficult to amend it <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the ministers answer is much what we expected <e> <s> he is confined by the bill as it is drafted <e> <s> he said that scottish enterprise and highlands and islands enterprise will be expected to consult <e> <s> the whole point is that they need not do so <e> <s> that is what worries me <e> <s> the noble lord pointed out that the plans have to be looked at every year <e> <s> but will training be long-term or short-term <e> <s> that point was also mentioned by the noble baroness lady carnegy <e> <s> i am sure that there must be a balance <e> <s> the aim should be to give people enough training so that the area becomes established as a place for certain types of work <e>", "<cs> i feel that i am in a no-mans land between two people who have been through the hallowed portals of old st andrews house and new st andrews house <e> <s> i was never there but i was in other departments and i have a wee idea of how they work <e> <s> i have had cabinet ministers to whom it would have been rather difficult to go back and say i have lost this amendment <e> <s> so we are all aware of what happens <e>", "<cs> the shareholders in scotland have given their verdict on the management of the economy in scotland fairly thoroughly over the past few years <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble viscount would accept their verdict as <e>", "<cs> the minister and my noble friend lord hughes obviously see the amendment as i do as a technical one <e> <s> the minister has gone through the bill <e> <s> i was unable to follow him but i am sure that what he said has been well checked <e> <s> between now and report i may be able to lumber my own way through it <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for agreeing to look at this issue again <e> <s> he is probably right in saying that we are not all that far apart ideologically in this little part of the bill <e> <s> i understand what the noble baroness lady carnegy of lour was getting at <e> <s> we are not trying to stifle enterprise at all but we are slightly afraid that in an area one can get a particularly powerful tail that wags the dog and perhaps causes a great deal of damage <e> <s> we have all had experience of that <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> for the government to take credit for the success of oil is a bit rich <e> <s> we think that they have wasted the oil proceeds some billion of them <e> <s> and with all that they have still managed such an economic record <e>", "<cs> that reply changes what i had intended to say because i shall need to read the document <e> <s> the minister heard all members on this side of the committee speak of the importance that they attach to the selling of these assets <e> <s> i wish that i had the ministers confidence that they will be sold at a reasonable price <e> <s> whatever bricks and mortar are in the houses they and other properties have been made acceptable by the work and the devotion of the people who built up the area <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the minister whether district councils would definitely be an option at the wind-up <e>", "<cs> the noble earl lord perth says that he is confused <e> <s> he is not alone <e> <s> we are all in a state of confusion <e> <s> not having a copy of the pamphlet does not help <e> <s> i know that the minister is usually very courteous <e> <s> there must have been some slip-up in the distribution system <e>", "<cs> i believe not <e> <s> the amendment suggests that a tenant of a house owned by a development corporation <e>", "<cs> having listened carefully to that final comment by the minister the matter becomes even more confusing <e> <s> there is no way out except to take the amendment back read what the minister said re-read the appropriate parts of the white paper and the pamphlet provided by the minister and on the basis of that reconsider the <e>", "<cs> we are not always convinced that the governments sentiments are right <e> <s> that is why we keep asking for amendments on the face of the bill <e> <s> i have no doubt about the noble lords sentiments and good intentions but he does not run everything <e> <s> we shall study his statement with great care <e> <s> we may refine our amendment to accommodate what he has suggested and return to the matter at a later stage of the bill <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister think that this suggestion will go the same way as road pricing which was officially buried by the secretary of state for transport in another place yesterday <e> <s> does the noble viscount agree that there <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister include this side of the house when he sends a copy of the report to the noble baroness <e> <s> we should also like to see it <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said that london must compete effectively and we all agree with that <e> <s> the difficulty arises when one tries to compare profit-making with efficiency <e> <s> it is very difficult to believe that london is an efficient city <e> <s> it could be much more efficient if transport was improved and there was some re-allocation of business <e> <s> that is already taking place in the docklands which is taking away some traffic from central london <e> <s> has the minister considered the possibility as is the case in certain other capitals of a transport tax on businesses which have large numbers of employees coming into the centre of london <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not talking about road pricing <e> <s> to help public transport paris and certain other cities impose a tax on people who have businesses in the centre of the city <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the reaction from the benches behind the minister justifies our having put down this amendment <e> <s> i do not want to rehearse the arguments but to say the least there was a great deal of confusion as to whether or not this provision was included <e> <s> there were arguments as to whether it could be read into the bill or whether the highlands and islands were so distinct that it became quite a separate matter and therefore should not be mentioned in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said that we had been over this ground before <e> <s> he is quite correct <e> <s> however there is one difference and that difference is also the reason for the earlier amendment being withdrawn and the new amendment being submitted <e> <s> the difference is that we now have the pamphlet which shows as my noble friend lord hughes pointed out with great clarity an apparent change of mind by the government <e> <s> the one thing that was excluded from the pamphlet but which was in the white paper was the local authority <e>", "<cs> my lords we are always glad to know that unemployment is falling <e> <s> the minister will be aware however that we have a long way to go <e> <s> unemployment in two glasgow constituencies is as high as per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> whereas in certain parts of the south east it is per cent <e> <s> and is as low as per cent <e> <s> in midsussex <e> <s> the scottish figures do not include the fact that steel jobs will be going soon <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister has any idea of what the knockon effect of that will be <e> <s> more important still is the fact that in the past year the scottish office budget allocated to training was underspent because there were not enough young people to take it up <e> <s> can the noble lord say what the government intend to do to increase the confidence of young people in the training programme <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will perhaps be aware of the letter sent to the secretary of state by the convenor of cosla mrs jean mcfadden <e> <s> cosla realises that it has a duty to collect this charge and it realises that if local government is to continue the money must be collected <e> <s> however the officials of cosla have certainly reached the conclusion that the community charge constitutes a much greater administrative burden than even they predicted <e> <s> they have made a number of helpful suggestions which the minister may know about for example the need for publicity to encourage early notification of a change on the part of citizens who move house <e> <s> one of the biggest difficulties that arises when citizens move house even within the same district is that a totally new file has to be opened on them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for going through the bill and for the nice words that he said about all those who took part in the debates on it <e> <s> if as he suggested i raised key issues he will also be aware that they did not seem to unlock any real response from the government <e>", "<cs> my lords we all thank the noble lord lord goold for his introduction of the bill although not i hasten to say because we accept its purpose <e> <s> we all accept that a great deal has happened since the clyde port authority order was passed in and that a great deal needs to be changed but this is the wrong way to do it <e> <s> we should be grateful to the noble lord because he gave us rather more information than seemed to be available to the mover of the bill in another place <e> <s> i shall read the noble lords words with great interest before we reach the next stage of the bill because we now have more information than we had before <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> he will realise that i was making a general political point not a procedural point that the bill could have been introduced as a government bill <e> <s> we thought that that would have been preferable but we have no objection <e> <s> the other place plays around with procedure much more than we do <e>", "<cs> my lords for many years i represented in another place a constituency which was one of the melting pots for various religions in many cases world religions including sikhs moslems hindus and so on <e> <s> i saw such religions in the area growing from relatively small groups of under members but they were branches or parts of religions far bigger than the church of scotland and other established christian religions in scotland <e> <s> it seems to me that they would be covered <e> <s> i shall be interested to hear whether the minister can give me an assurance about that <e> <s> i saw the groups building up from to people to fairly large congregations <e> <s> however i suspect that some of them are still not much more than about strong <e> <s> i shall be happy if the minister can reassure me on that point for the sake of the people who will certainly be asking me about it <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first perform a pleasant duty <e> <s> it is the first time that the noble lord has introduced a major bill in fact it is the only bill this year concerning scotland <e> <s> i congratulate him on the thoroughness with which he introduced it <e> <s> his survey was helpful and comprehensive <e> <s> it means that our understanding of the bill is much greater than it was so much needed more explanation <e> <s> i welcome the noble lord who comes from close to my own part of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has given figures for planting over the past two decades <e> <s> can he give some idea of how employment has fared in the forestry industry over that period <e> <s> his noble friend lord stodart mentioned that five jobs were lost in a certain area <e> <s> knowing some of these areas i believe that five jobs are important <e> <s> it would be interesting to compare the figures <e>"]
