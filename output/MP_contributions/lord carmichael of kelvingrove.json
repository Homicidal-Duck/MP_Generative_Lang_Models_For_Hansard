["<cs> this has been an interesting debate in that we have realised there is really no justification whatsoever for increasing the discount from to per cent <e> <s> while i can appreciate the point made by the noble earl lord selkirk that he is not really concerned and he could not find any emotional involvement in it i think the point which it is important to appreciate and i am sure he knows this at least as well as i do is that one of the major problems in scotland has been the type of industry we have had the whole clyde estuary and the dundee area have always been areas of hunger and poverty as well as the mobility of labour required <e> <s> because of that as my noble friend lord ross of marnock said very few people had jobs of long or steady tenure <e> <s> that is one of the reasons why there was never the same house ownership in scotland as there was in other parts of the country <e>", "<cs> since the noble lord the minister dealt rather widely with clause perhaps he will go on to answer the question that i put to him <e> <s> i asked exactly how one makes sure if one is an atomic energy authority tenant in a place such as dounreay that one will get a local authority house and ensure that ones time in the aea house will count towards the purchase <e> <s> there could be an understandable reluctance on the part of a local authority to provide houses particularly the more saleable types of houses to people who are in tied houses knowing that after two years they would lose them permanently from the stock <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister will not be surprised to realise that his answers have not been totally successful in allaying the fears of the committee <e> <s> he quoted quite correctly subsections and of section of the act and he also pointed out that local authorities have not urged the secretary of state to use his power <e> <s> the noble lord lord mackie made one very important point when he said that it is rather early days to discover whether local authorities will not at some point require to use those powers <e> <s> the period between and today is not all that long for someone contemplating purchasing a house and it is also right in the middle of a recession when perhaps there are fewer demands by people to buy second homes than there were previously or will be in the future <e>", "<cs> the noble lords reply is disappointing <e> <s> he began by saying that there is <e>", "<cs> the minister has to some extent satisfied me although he has left a great number of questions unanswered <e> <s> in fact he almost himself raised questions which he has left unanswered for instance what happens when it is a major structural repair <e> <s> we know that that point was partly covered by the fact that the liability would be somewhere between and <e> <s> i assume that there will be some way of keeping pace with inflation and changing times <e> <s> buildings last a long time <e> <s> in or years could look very silly <e> <s> i am not even sure whether a great deal would be done now by many-builders for <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble and learned lord the lord advocate could expand on what is meant by general planning authority <e> <s> the phrase district planning authority is understandable <e> <s> do i take it that when he talks about general planning authority he means for instance the highlands board or some area such as the gear project in the east or west end of glasgow <e> <s> i wonder whether he will kindly intervene to clear this matter up <e>", "<cs> my lords that clears up the point so far as tonight is concerned <e> <s> when one thinks of it is the noble and learned lord the lord advocate not introducing a new title or definition of the western isles the orkney isles district council or the highland and islands council by calling them general planning authorities <e> <s> i think it would be rather confusing as it obviously was to your lordships here tonight when the noble lord spoke suddenly about general and district planning authorities <e> <s> tonight it is understandable but i wonder whether in the future there will need to be some clarification in the bill in order to spell out that a general planning authority would be the authority which had both regional and district functions as the highlands and islands authorities have <e> <s> i find it slightly confusing <e> <s> i believe from looking at other noble lords in the chamber that they have a feeling of puzzlement as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say how grateful we are to the lord advocate for adding this <e> <s> when we are trying to expand industry and at the same time have additional roads where necessary it is important that industry should be included <e> <s> i understand the special needs of agriculture when a new road can totally cut a field or a farm in two <e> <s> it is important that industry should be considered in planning as well <e> <s> we are grateful to the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i was grateful to get the opinion of the noble and learned lord the lord advocate as to why the words raise or lower or otherwise should be retained but i feel that it would help to reduce the wordage <e> <s> i understand the question of a camber in the road the road may be raised at one point and lowered at another <e> <s> but i still cannot understand and i may be rather dull why a roads authority may alter as they think fit the level of a public road cannot apply to that <e> <s> they could raise the outside of the bend by one foot and lower the inside by six inches and that would still be altering as they think fit <e> <s> i do not want to be pedantic about it but i feel that it is something which would make it easier when it goes to the other place at a later stage if the noble and learned lord the lord advocate could give it some thought <e> <s> i hope he will think about it again <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the lord advocate for having looked at this point <e> <s> it was actually the automobile association through i think their legal department who had some problems with this very subject with <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the lord advocate for having taken the trouble to find a form of words that expresses fairly well what i was trying to explain to the committee <e> <s> i thank him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e> <s> as regards changing carriageway to road i should like to ask the noble and learned lord a question relating to an earlier matter as regards which we should perhaps have put down an amendment <e> <s> i understand that it has to be road because carriageway is merely the road upon which a carriage or vehicle will drive <e> <s> therefore the road presumably extends from the heel of the pavement to the heel of the pavement if we still have pavements i am not sure whether we do have them in scotland <e> <s> is that why the roads authority is now totally responsible for the removal of for instance snow and therefore there would need to be a much more complicated definition than road if the roads authority were not responsible for removing for example snow from the frontages of commercial and domestic premises <e> <s> is that one of the reasons behind the fact that we have been trapped into a situation where the roads authority on the day of a snowfall will need to get out and clear all the snow from the pavements and what we still call the road <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the lord advocate and to all those who took part for clarifying to the public the problems arising in this clause <e> <s> having heard the explanation i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i can see the purpose of the explanation of the noble and learned lord the lord advocate but as a layman and perhaps this is why one should always get legal advice i can see myself looking at a footpath and taking the major definition that is within the interpretation clause and not going further on whereas if the explanations given under subsection were referred more immediately to certain sections within the interpretation clause then to someone like myself a layman the interpretation clause would be more understandable <e> <s> there is a genuine confusion for someone like me in finding that something was not picked up earlier which appears to have been added at the end <e> <s> i agree that it removes any danger of doubt but as my noble friend lord ross of marnock said we are not disagreeing with the substance but merely with the placing within the bill of these particular clauses <e>", "<cs> my lords we went through all this in committee <e> <s> the minister has spoken about freedom of choice <e> <s> i must come back to the point that for many thousands of people in scotland freedom of choice does not exist because the government have starved local authorities of capital for building local authority housing <e> <s> by this measure the government are encouraging people to take houses out of the housing stock of local authorities <e> <s> therefore they are making the possibility of the homeless obtaining housing even more difficult than it is at present <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister has given a long explanation <e> <s> he did not however cover the very important point that was made by my noble friend namely the question of whether local authorities would be likely to look favourably upon someone coming from one of the occupations detailed in clause paragraphs <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill has been debated at great length in another place <e> <s> it has also been debated very widely in scotland by the individual local authorities by cosla by professional bodies particularly the assessors the chambers of commerce and the scottish cbi <e> <s> in many respects the principles behind the bill were very fully debated on monday when your lordships house dealt with the english rates bill <e> <s> i think it should be pointed out to welsh and english members that this bill takes even more power than was taken in the bill which raised the historic vote in this house on monday <e>"]
