["<cs> my lords i am glad to be following the noble lord lord hayter in this debate <e> <s> as we have heard he is the chairman of the international freight sector unit of the national economic development council organisation and therefore has been running one of the little neddys as they are known <e> <s> from all that i have heard of it that body certainly has the reputation for getting things done and i am sure he is largely responsible for that success <e> <s> but i think i detected a complaint from him that there has been an air of euphoria in the debate so far <e> <s> i shall certainly not contribute to that <e> <s> he referred to a saying of mark twain that everybody talks about the weather but no one does anything about it <e> <s> that prompted me to think of another saying attributed to the same author that a certain piece of music was better than it sounded <e> <s> i hope that the departments and all others concerned will examine carefully the contributions that are being made to this debate today when they read them in the <e>", "<cs> my lords before the government publish their proposed paper will they be addressing themselves to the policies of both the parole boards as they may be operating on different lines <e> <s> this question refers to the parole board and it is not clear whether the policies of the board north of the border and the board south of the border are to be considered <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord leaves that point i wonder whether he would also comment on the fact that perhaps there is an association between what he has said and the fact that a jury in scotland can bring in a verdict of not proven <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult to follow my four noble friends who have already spoken on the main points which arise from my noble friends motion <e> <s> my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter has given a masterly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i was indeed going to move to that point <e> <s> i do not wish to detain your lordships for long on this matter but it is important <e> <s> i was asking why it was that the figures even for a few months were not available <e> <s> the answer is because of an industrial <e>", "<cs> in a moment <e> <s> i have already decided that i will not disclose the place <e> <s> i believe it is not the only one i think others have done it as well and i decided that i would not disclose a particular place <e> <s> i give it as an example <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already given way <e> <s> but if the noble lord is only going to ask the same question i have already answered it <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already decided that i would not <e> <s> so far as i am concerned i am not condemning anybody who does that kind of thing but i give it as an example because it can fulfil a purpose as long as it is not confused with the real jobs which are needed if britain is to recover <e> <s> the recovery of britain depends upon those real jobs rather than the stopgap schemes which as i say do have a place in helping during difficult periods <e> <s> the government are now setting about the task in the right way the task of creating the climate in which british industry can succeed and provide the real jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord zuckerman for that additional point <e> <s> may i just also take the opportunity as i had not sat down of continuing by saying that i do not intend to be what my noble friend lord mansfields father once said when the stone of scone was delivered to him at his home palace of scone <e> <s> he said take it away to those who had delivered it <e> <s> but when he was asked are you going to give us away though <e> <s> he said no <e> <s> i am not a campbell <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hale has complimented the select committee on this report and i hope it will not be immodest of me in following him to say that i am speaking as a member of sub-committee b which carried out the studies and prepared the draft of this report for the select committee <e> <s> in that context i should like to mention the chairman of that sub-committee the noble lord lord trevelyan because his sub-committee has been very active and its fruits have been coming to this house to be debated while he has been away in hospital <e> <s> he is now recovering from an operation <e> <s> three weeks ago we debated the report on shipping introduced by my noble friend lord rochdale who i am very glad to see is to speak today <e> <s> i am <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> my lords while i am sure that the government will clearly do their very best to help find solutions for these unfortunate refugees may i ask my noble friend whether he can give any further assurance to the british shipping industry concerning refugees who have been rescued by british ships <e> <s> will the government at the <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome in particular the last sentence of the statement which my noble friend has repeated namely that the secretaries of state for scotland and wales are expected to make separate recommendations in due course <e> <s> in the presentation of any proposals will the government make very clear that there is a different and separate system of health services in scotland for which the scottish secretary and the scottish office are responsible and not the dhss <e> <s> will they also especially bear in mind that in that scottish system which was restructured in a scottish act in the early s there is only one tier of health boards <e> <s> while that scottish service may be far from perfect whatever criticisms are being levelled and have been levelled at the health service in england and wales many of those criticisms are not applicable to the health service north of the border <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend confirm that because salmon returning to their rivers to spawn swim close to the surface they could virtually be wiped out by unrestricted continuous drift netting round the mouths of rivers and that this threat has arisen only within the last years because of the new man-made fibres <e> <s> previously the salmon were strong enough to break the mesh <e>", "<cs> my lords before we do so as only three minutes have passed can my noble friend confirm that because salmon fishings are highly rated as in paying local rates in scotland a great deal of finance comes in to local authorities and it is an important element in the economy in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will want to wish my noble friend who has put down this question a happy birthday today <e>", "<cs> my lords while the right of innocent passage is of great importance to this country all over the world and the minch is within the territorial waters of the united kingdom may i ask whether the government will none the less put all the pressure and influence they can into arranging for oil tankers to avoid the minch and to go round west of the hebrides <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble and learned friend for introducing this bill and for his explanation of its purposes <e> <s> i agree with my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor that we need to replace section of the act <e> <s> i propose to make some brief comments and to put two questions to the government <e> <s> in doing this i am very conscious that i am following in the debate three leading lawyers and three of the most brilliant legal minds in the land <e> <s> i shall accordingly concentrate strictly on the administrative side of this question <e> <s> on prosecutions though my noble and learned friend invited someone with experience of scottish administration to confirm the <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend will allow me to interrupt i did not in fact mention cabinet papers and it was not my purpose to disagree because i believe that there need not be a rule to protect cabinet <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend will give way i tried to make it clear that the areas were south of the border <e> <s> there are no areas in scotland <e> <s> i mentioned some of the areas essex south shields and hartlepool <e> <s> i want to make it clear that i was not raising it in a scottish context because it does not apply in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i gave notice to the noble lord the chairman of committees that i should like to make a very brief comment on this bill at this stage because i spoke on the second reading on th february and drew attention to clause <e> <s> i pointed out that it was objectionable because it would have granted a particular power to a single local authority a power which parliament had made clear it was not prepared to confer upon local authorities in a public bill <e> <s> to complete the picture for your lordships now i express contentment because during june the promoters of the bill asked for the withdrawal of clause and so what i was seeking has now happened <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord was here when i spoke at the beginning of this debate and therefore he should remember that i myself said that i thought the greatest danger of all was the possible use of plutonium by terrorists or some irresponsible powers <e> <s> but i may point out to him first that the present system the agr and magnox produces a small quantity of plutonium now and secondly that the fast breeder reactor which uses plutonium as a fuel can either use it all up <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for introducing this bill and i warmly welcome the accession of greece to the eec <e> <s> i applaud the conclusion of the accession agreement <e> <s> i feel a sense of history not only because greece was the source of european civilisation over years ago but also because of very recent history <e> <s> greece was the first european country to become an associate member of the eec through the agreement of though that was suspended as my noble friend reminded us between and <e> <s> then it was a year after that that the greeks applied for full membership <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord trenchard the minister of state for introducing this bill so clearly <e> <s> it seems to me to be very urgent <e> <s> it seems as though it is needed by christmas and i hope the house will give it a quick passage <e> <s> clause i certainly appears to be needed before christmas because british shipbuilders are likely to exceed the previous limit of million by january <e> <s> since the debates on this bill were held in another place there has been a report in the press it appeared at the end of last week that an estimate had been made of the losses in the current year and that these were working out at about million more than the target loss which had been set by the previous government <e> <s> i wonder whether when my noble friend replies he will make any comment on this and on its effect on the financial part of the bill other than that it must make the bill even more urgent <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps my noble friend will give way because i may be able to help him here <e>", "<cs> my lords my reference was to an article published in the business news of <e>", "<cs> i am very glad to follow the noble lord lord maybray-king <e> <s> i was able at second reading to express my pleasure at the impending accession of greece and i will not repeat my words but this is the appropriate stage of the passage of this bill at which to elicit the governments views on certain matters which will arise when greece does accede <e> <s> there will be consequences and repercussions for british industry some of them good such as the new opportunities which the greek market will afford others difficult <e> <s> i made reference to this subject briefly at second reading as did one or two other speakers <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for replying to the points which i raised <e>", "<cs> i am so sorry <e> <s> does someone else wish to speak <e> <s> we are in committee <e> <s> i thought that as the noble lord lord wells-pestell was rising to his feet he wished to address us on clause <e> <s> however i understand that he does not wish to address the committee at this stage <e> <s> therefore i shall speak on clause in this committee stage <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that addition because i understood that the present voluntary agreements would have to come to an end <e> <s> however i had thought and certainly some sections of the industry had thought that it would be legal to conclude a new agreement direct with greece <e> <s> my noble friend then dealt with protocol <e> <s> i was glad that he recognised that there is a possible source of difficulty there <e> <s> he pointed out that at the time of the accession of the republic of ireland at the beginning of the united kingdom textile industry appeared to be in a much more robust position to be able to compete with new investment coming in on a large scale with unfair assistance in ireland <e> <s> but in saying that he clearly accepts that the position is different now and that the position of the united kingdom would be damaged if similar action were to take place in greece <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend the minister of state confirm that the government of west germany already restrict outward processing to <e>", "<cs> my lords may i simply say in a minute or two that i am very glad to follow the noble lord lord caccia who has personally witnessed events in greece before during and after the war and to hear his welcome to this bill <e> <s> i should like to thank my noble friend because i raised a number of points concerning the effects on this country for as we welcome greece we must also recognise that there will be problems for some of our industries particularly textiles and clothing <e> <s> i confirm that my noble friend was able to answer all the main points which i raised during the two earlier stages <e> <s> as i also on second reading expressed the hope that we would be the first to ratify i am very glad to hear that news brought to us today by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords being a member of the select <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to follow the noble and learned lord lord wilson of lang-side who besides having been a lord advocate after that undertook the reorganisation of the administration of the courts in scotland in the early s <e> <s> he is well qualified to take part in the later stages of this bill and the examination of it which he has urged upon the house <e> <s> we are singularly fortunate in having the noble earl lord mansfield to pilot the bill through and to introduce it in the clear way that he did today <e> <s> he is familiar with the law in scotland and also in england <e> <s> in that respect he follows a tradition set by at least one of his distinguished ancestors <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend confirm that the present position is that so far the total of public expenditure is being held at about the same level and it is future planned increases in public expenditure which are now being considered for reduction <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend assist the house by recalling any instance in modern history in which a traffic forecast in this country has later in the event proved to be even approximately correct <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the committee is very grateful to the noble lord lord foot for having very helpfully in moving his first amendment given some background to the reasons for the amendments which have been placed on the marshalled list by him and his noble friend lord wigoder concerning the first few clauses in the bill <e> <s> i was glad to hear him say because this is something which is common to most of us judging from the speeches on the second reading and other comments that have been made that he recognises that some additional powers are needed by the police in scotland <e> <s> it is important that <e>", "<cs> i am very glad to have elicited that because the noble lord will find that he said in his remarks at one point clauses to <e> <s> that made me realise that he has clearly addressed himself to everything that has been produced by the thomson committee but he may have not realised as is stated in the bill that the bill is founded on the reports of other bodies as well <e> <s> i felt that i must say something on behalf of the scottish council on crime because i had the responsibility of bringing the council into existence and appointing it in <e> <s> it reported to the noble lord lord ross of marnock and he wrote a very polite foreword to the report and congratulated the council upon its work and commended it for the study of everyone concerned <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord will allow me to intervene <e> <s> i am sorry to interrupt him <e> <s> i think that he is referring to an amendment on this question which is in my <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to receive that explanation <e> <s> i also recognise that it is the immediately following amendment the question of the police having discretion to delay <e>", "<cs> my lords although i accept that the practice in this question would be very inhuman and cruel can my noble friend the minister inform the house whether there is any special market in the far east for the old antlers of long-dead stags <e> <s> some of us whose homes are in the highlands have a considerable surplus of that commodity which might make a small contribution to britains exports without involving any cruelty whatever <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness would allow me to intervene of course the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster at that time was the noble lord lord lever and he was in a position to do this <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord kennet for raising this subject this evening <e> <s> we are indebted to him <e> <s> i took part in the debate on th february which unfortunately he could not move because of his illness but i am glad that he is here today <e> <s> i am also glad to follow the noble lord lord ritchie-calder <e> <s> he and i work together on the advisory committee on oil pollution of the sea <e>", "<cs> my lords could my noble friend tell us why the financial mechanism which was specially negotiated in before the referendum took place has apparently not been effective <e>", "<cs> my lords the time for consultation on the consultative document was to end originally in january and that was later deferred <e> <s> do the government intend to continue consultation in view of the change of government in the meantime <e> <s> do they intend to keep up the momentum by issuing a document based on the representations so far received in order not to lose the full benefits of the wolfenden committee report which was published years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ross of marnock in moving this amendment at the end made reference to me as having set up the scottish council on crime and having drawn attention to the fact that they did recommend that a power of this kind should be given to the police in scotland <e> <s> i agree that in their recommendation they said that it should be tried for a period i think of five years if i remember rightly but they did make this positive recommendation <e> <s> the noble lord started by referring again to the question of the weapons in this clause and on the last amendment my noble friend lord mansfield was not attracted to that idea <e> <s> my mind is certainly open on it and i would ask the government to have a look at this again if it is going to improve the clause from the point of view of those who are worried about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the noble and learned lord lord fraser of tullybelton has still to speak but as i propose to say a few words perhaps i ought from this part of the house to do so next because the noble and learned lord lord keith of kinkel explained the purpose of his amendment when speaking to the earlier one <e> <s> it is a brave layman who intervenes where judges and learned advocates are speaking on a subject of this kind <e> <s> i do so as some noble lords will know because i was secretary of state for scotland in and at that time set up the emslie committee under the noble and learned lord lord emslie who then reported to me in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i am very glad to have given him this opportunity to intervene and clarify what he was saying <e> <s> i agree that the question of discretion is important and i hope that my noble friend when he replies will be able to say more about the words in the clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord for giving way <e> <s> it was in fact because of the difficulties that i <e>", "<cs> my lords would not our proceedings be improved if also the reverse of the medal proposed by the noble earl lord listowel were more widely observed that when a noble lord finds that he cannot stay for the closing speeches in a debate he should withdraw his name from the list and refrain from taking part <e> <s> when this happens it is a praiseworthy act of self-denial <e> <s> sometimes it can also be an act of mercy when it helps to shorten a very long list of speakers <e>", "<cs> my lords is not this course the best and most satisfactory that could be adopted now in these circumstances and speaking with the same political detachment as the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones may i ask my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor if he would agree that ministers powers can be in some doubt because of the legal advice available to them <e> <s> which can be both vague and contradictory <e> <s> may not this also have been the case when mr mulley was having to deal as secretary of state for education with a similar kind of case and was found to have exceeded his powers <e> <s> i speak with some feeling in this matter as a former minister who had a <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend confirm that investment in new plant and equipment necessary for the competitive state of the british industry inevitably leads to fewer jobs for the same quantity of production <e> <s> does he agree that that is also experienced by our competitors abroad but that most of them unfortunately have been able to tackle their difficult problems of redundancy sooner and more realistically than we have done in this country <e> <s> moreover will my noble friend confirm in relation to what the noble baroness lady gaitskell said that if we had started sooner most if not all of the redundancies might have been voluntary rather than compulsory and associated with large payments <e>", "<cs> my lords many subjects are discussed in the two reports which we are considering today and the noble baroness lady white has with clarity extracted from the reports the most important points from what are long documents <e> <s> the house is indebted to her <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed i do and that of course is the way in which the united nations operates because there are so many languages there a number of working languages and a number of official languages and there have been a number of arguments about that <e> <s> i sat behind the noble lord lord gladwyn years ago in the security council when i was a diplomat we were dealing with korea in <e> <s> the problems of language were arising then because there were only about members of the united nations at that time whereas my latest count is nearly now <e> <s> they have been through all this but again they do not have the problems of legal application in member countries <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend give the house the latest report on the associated matter of compensation particularly where the three principal companies in naval shipbuilding are concerned <e> <s> as they were flourishing concerns at the time of nationalisation <e> <s> at least three years have passed and as yet nothing appears to have happened <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his reply and applaud the governments tackling of this essential task <e> <s> but is my noble friend aware of the strategem employed by some departments and public bodies of selecting for the axe items widely regarded as sacrosanct in the hope that the subsequent outcry will save them <e> <s> will the government issue guidelines to concentrate on reducing bureaucracy and eliminating waste such as the overheating of public buildings <e> <s> this would also have the beneficial effect of relieving the congestion in the correspondence columns of <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his reply <e> <s> i recognise that neither he nor the government were responsible for the content of the programme but is he aware that the programmes effect was damaging to the reputation of the army and to its difficult role in northern ireland <e> <s> is it not an extraordinary paradox that the general public should have paid through their licence fees for a programme which largely nullified the recruiting effort which the general public had also paid for out of taxation <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell the house whether the shortfall in the police is regionally variable and whether i am right in thinking that in scotland there arc almost no vacancies <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that reply especially because the tasks of tapping and recording are carried out by the post office who the judge must surely satisfy himself should not exceed their directives through zeal or for any other reason <e> <s> will the judge be expected to report on any private eavesdropping that comes to his notice such as the activation of telephones by detective agencies or for commercial espionage <e> <s> while deliberate intrusion into privacy is naturally resented none the less would it not be foolish for anyone to regard the telephone system as secure for confidential information in view of the number of crossed lines which many of us encounter almost daily <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that i regard his answer as meaning that if the senior judge is not given the facilities for which he asks he will make this clear in his first report which is to be published <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> does he accept that certain british industries will in any case suffer dis <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the report of your lordships select committee on enlargement has been widely acclaimed as a concise and realistic assessment <e> <s> indeed that is in particular a tribute to the noble lord lord trevelyan who was chairman of the sub-committee and whom i am sure all of your lordships were glad to see return to the house recently after his illness <e> <s> does my noble friend recognise that the benefits of that report have not come to an end because its recommendations apply to the periods of negotiation and of transition <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord very kindly give way <e> <s> he has referred to my speech and it is better if i make the point now rather than later <e> <s> my reference to p was i hope not a prediction <e> <s> i was making it in connection with the suggestion i was making for reducing the cost of the service <e> <s> it was certainly not a prediction and i very much hope that it will not come about <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all of the noble lords who have contributed to the debate today <e> <s> as a result a number of different topics of concern to the public have been raised for example postal codes air mail telecommunications equipment

the years i too have followed proposals of this kind <e> <s> but i am going to introduce a note of dissent into the debate because i am hoping that the government will be able to take action in due course but in a much broader field <e> <s> i believe that to tack on this as a schedule to a social security bill is the wrong way of proceeding <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government made an estimate of the number of jobs likely to be lost the unemployment likely to be caused as a result of the inaction for which the tuc have called were it to be fully observed in a weeks time <e>", "<cs> my lords in moving this amendment the noble lord lord rochester made reference to support that was given to a somewhat similar amendment in july nearly five years ago when we were dealing with the industry bill which became the industry act <e> <s> this is very relevant because clause of the present bill has the effect of repealing sections to the whole machinery on which we spent three days at committee stage at that time dealing with disclosure of information <e> <s> and this was not a procedure applying only to the national enterprise board and bodies within its control it was to cover the whole of manufacturing industry in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down may i say that i know that my questions were put at short notice and i apologise for not

which the civil service <e>", "<cs> my lords does not this subject very largely depend upon world prices of crude oil which have been increasing alarmingly and may it not before too long be cheaper to extract oil from coal than to extract oil from opec <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that some of us who over the years have been dealing with the problems of the old hebrides which sometimes have appeared to be never ending wish him all success in dealing with this complex and difficult situation which has arisen in the new hebrides <e>", "<cs> my lords while i recognise that the soviet union has been completely intransigent so far may i ask whether my noble friend is aware that hess has for some years been serving a sentence more severe than that meted out to him namely solitary confinement simply because the others in the prison have either died or been released <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that although two and a half years are still available for the new eec common <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind the very late hours which we have been warned the house will have to sit in july and early august may i ask the minister whether the government will consider providing four-posters in the library in addition to the proposed display <e>", "<cs> my lords i too thank my noble friend lord ohagan for giving us this timely opportunity to discuss this question and also for giving us his own first-hand account of the events which led up to the brussels meeting at the end of may <e> <s> i am glad also to follow the noble lord lord sherfield who

kingdom policy which recognised both the right of the state of israel to exist and the reasonable rights of palestinian refugees <e> <s> is not this a policy which is most likely to lead to a peaceful and stable settlement in the interests of the world and also in the interests of britain <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend confirm that it was indeed other groups of islands as well as the western isles which were threatened with this surcharge because the generation of electricity had to be by diesel oil and therefore was expensive <e> <s> however will my noble friend accept that the large majority of those on the mainland made it clear through the press and in other ways that they were happy to pay the extra which would fall on them in order that these island groups should not in

to have happened and he would have had to be in the first six in the annual ballot for private members bills <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad to follow the noble lord lord boothby <e> <s> i thank

local government in scotland after about five years of the present system being in operation <e> <s> my noble friend was lucky in the ballot <e> <s> he came first in the first ballot of the session and the only mischance that i see in that and which he could not possibly have foreseen is that the report of the stodart committee is not yet available <e> <s> the committee was set up to look into the subject that is before us today and it was instructed to report in december this month <e> <s> so i would ask my noble friend lord mansfield when he replies whether he can give an indication of when the report will be published <e> <s> no doubt the secretary of state for scotland will wish to look at it himself before it becomes public <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a problem and we dealt with a crofting bill at some length three or four years ago in this house <e> <s> but it is even more difficult than that because the isles of bute and arran have been added to the highland development board area and there are a number of boundaries of that kind which do not accord fully with local government boundaries <e> <s> it is one of the many complications which arise in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend would give way <e> <s> i think this point about lord provosts is important because the lord provost is automatically the lord lieutenant of the city <e> <s>

nodules on the <e>", "<cs> in response to the invitation from my noble friend i rise to speak briefly to his amendment on the point which he mentioned <e> <s> i would ask my noble friend lord gowrie to have a look at the legislation and practice in scotland <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> the consequential amendment to this specifically excludes scotland from this amendment <e> <s> the reason as i see it is because the situation is already more satisfactory in scotland <e> <s> there exist there arrangements where surplus energy from private hydropower can be paid into the grid instead of being wasted <e> <s> i may be out-of-date but that is i understand still the position <e>", "<cs> my lords it is reported that the new american administration will within the next few days do away with controls on the prices of domestic petroleum products <e> <s> can my noble friend confirm that that is due to happen very shortly and have the government yet calculated to what extent the subsidy to american manufacturers will be reduced by that change <e>", "<cs> my lords i joined my noble friend lord strathcona during the committee stage and i am very glad to hear my noble friend the minister say that the government intend to table an amendment while the bill is in this house <e> <s> it sounds as though the amendment will go a considerable way in the direction which my noble friend lord strathcona seeks <e> <s> however in the intervention which i made on committee i asked my noble friend lord gowrie whether he would look at the position in scotland <e> <s> when speaking just now he said that these changes were to take place for england and wales <e> <s> if the house will give him permission to speak again perhaps he would confirm that the amendment which he proposes will be restricted to england and wales <e>", "<cs> while my noble friend is considering that point i should like to take up something that the noble lord lord kennet has said <e> <s> my understanding is and i should be grateful if my noble friend lord gowrie can confirm it that like the americans the germans in their legislation have already adopted the figure <e> <s> i am not sure whether they have put in the alternative option which the americans have put in and which is in this bill as well hut they have certainly adopted the same level <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord decides whether he is going to speak to or not move the amendment he has referred to which is no <e> <s> it would be of assistance to members of the committee if it could be clarified whether this is a printing mistake <e> <s> i imagined when i first saw it on a list not the marshalled list that it was one of lord lloyds amendments because it seemed to go with amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> when it appeared on the marshalled list below the name of my noble friend lord gowrie after amendment no <e> <s> i was thinking he was coming forward to meet the noble lords point and had put the amendment down on the same day <e> <s> these amendments appear with an asterisk and therefore were put down yesterday and appeared only today <e> <s> i presume amendment no was tabled by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran

amendment no <e> <s> but has clarified the position i should like to thank him <e> <s> he does not need to apologise to the committee because his amendments were very clear <e> <s> the confusion has been caused by the marshalled list being printed incorrectly <e> <s> we thought it was a government amendment <e> <s> my noble friend lord gowrie has indicated that he will look at this question

is being put lead us to stumble without meaning to into the <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate my noble friend lord glenkinglas on having initiated this debate and for having introduced it in such an effective and agreeable way <e> <s> i was a colleague with him in the cabinet between and and well remember the problems with which he had to deal particularly the amalgamation to form british airways

caledonian <e> <s> in particular some of the british leaders in the private enterprise sector and i think particularly of mr adam thomson and sir freddie laker have played leading parts in keeping the costs of air travel from becoming prohibitive for ordinary people <e> <s> my noble friends policies also led to the expansion and competitive success of british private airlines <e> <s> this was illustrated by the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede when he told us that six out of the largest european airlines are british airlines <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord lord brockway for giving us this opportunity to discuss hong kong and of course as the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts has said our relations with china which inevitably arise on that subject <e> <s> the noble lord lord brockway gave us his sincere impressions from correspondence over years with residents in hong kong <e> <s> he spoke of a gulf between the hong kong administration and the people <e> <s> i wish that he had visited hong kong he told us that he never has because i think lie would have formed a somewhat different view and that he would accept the astonishing achievements of the hong kong community administration and people against a background of pressing problems caused by hosts of refugees and the density of the population <e>", "<cs> my lords on the concept of an international force for rapid deployment can my noble friend confirm that it is the intention that such a force would not be deployed in any country except after a request from the country concerned <e> <s> if he can confirm that could not that be made public immediately in the parts of the world where there now appears to be anxiety <e> <s> can he not also publicise in those areas the fact that if there were troops and supporting arms in a reasonable state of readiness such a force should be helpful to them if they felt threatened <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran is to be congratulated on having had the effect on the government of their saying that they will be bringing forward amendments to meet this point and the points of other noble lords such as the noble lord lord sebohm who have been concerned with this matter <e> <s> like my noble friend i hope that it will be possible for these amendments to be introduced into your lordships house if they can be drafted in time rather than into another place <e> <s> but the fact that the government are responding to these amendments and will produce a formula which one hopes will meet all the problems means i think that the principle has been accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house and also the country will congratulate the government on the firm stand that they have taken in defending the british fishing industry and its interests <e> <s> but will the government bear in mind in these crucial talks that while uncertainty is the enemy of all fishermen and that all the fishermen in the eec will want uncertainty to be ended none the less the fishing areas the fishing grounds round britain and particularly round scotland are the most prolific and fruitful ones because of conservation measures in the past whereas the coastal areas off france belgium and the other continental countries have been more or less fished out <e> <s> therefore there is a danger of the remaining fruitful areas round the coasts of britain being fished out also unless there really is a satisfactory agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to speak following the noble lord lord peart and to hear him express approval

benefit of the british fishing industry <e> <s> when i was a fisheries minister as secretary of state for scotland i was involved in negotiations with the eec and the problems of iceland <e> <s> i too

aware that there are occasions when progress in negotiation with the soviets is much more likely when it is carried out away from the glare of publicity <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank as i am sure would other noble lords my noble friend lord mansfield for the very clear way in which he introduced this bill <e> <s> i propose to raise three points about three of the miscellaneous provisions <e> <s> the first and most important is in clause which has just been alluded to by the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside <e> <s> as chairman for scotland of the international

great deal about salmon his home being near the tay and so i shall not need to remind him about them <e> <s> however i should like to remind the committee that although this part of the bill deals with the sea fish industry and the authority is called the sea fish authority salmon and migratory trout spend a great deal of their lives in the open sea <e>", "<cs> arising from a point which the noble lord lord ross of marnock raised i wonder whether my noble friend can answer this point <e> <s> perhaps if he cannot do it now he could let me know later or at a later stage of the bill <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross referred to cosla the convention of scottish local authorities which represents as a single body now the scottish local authorities not community councils but the others <e> <s> he also mentioned the assessors in scotland who are as we discussed earlier in this bill a very special band because the assessment is done in a different way south of the border <e> <s> but i remember that there was a body or association of scottish assessors which represented their interests and so far as i know if that still exists it is separate from cosla <e> <s> can my noble friend lord mansfield tell me whether the assessors are normally represented in this <e> <s> is it expected that someone will be appointed from that body with their special knowledge of assessment in scotland <e>", "<cs> if the noble baroness would look at this bill and at schedule she will see a whole list of powers that are to be given up if they are approved <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend for the benefit of the house indicate whether there is a misprint in the question as it is printed on the order paper <e> <s> should not the figure be billion rather than million <e> <s> otherwise it seems that we are getting trident on the cheap <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down i should like to thank him for that very careful and considered statement and to add that for my part in the circumstances which he has described i would not expect a public inquiry but i hope that the investigations that he has described will continue to try to see whether improvements can be made in safety <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his reply <e> <s> is he aware that although in a passport her britannic majestys principal secretary of state requests and requires all whom it may concern to allow the bearer to pass freely without let or hindrance there is a great deal of hindrance at present at the passport offices themselves to the immense inconvenience of loyal and deserving citizens <e> <s> is my noble friend further aware that though the unions have stated that it was not their intention to disrupt the lives of the public family holidays and business travel are being seriously disrupted <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend confirm that the information which involves registration numbers and the owners or keepers of vehicles has not been regarded as private and personal information and indeed if it were not available to the police it would be very difficult for some crimes to be discovered <e> <s> also is it not correct that the man who is now standing trial as the yorkshire ripper was discovered by that means <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble baroness lady masham on her introduction of this bill and for piloting it through your lordships house <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate those in another place who were responsible for helping to get this bill to us and in particularly the honourable member for caernarvon mr wigley <e> <s> as the noble baroness has reminded us the bill in this form has not been discussed at all in parliament <e> <s> it has been the subject of a great deal of negotiation with the government behind the scenes <e> <s> therefore i hope that at its various stages in this house we shall be able to air publicly some of the matters in the bill and some of those which may still be at issue <e> <s> i understand very well as i am sure others do who have been in the commons the difficulties that exist in finding time for private members bills especially if they are controversial or complicated <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord is referring to the cry object rather than no <e> <s> this is a device in the other place when people feel that a debate is necessary <e> <s> they are not objecting to the bill they are objecting to it going through without debate <e> <s> i am sure we agree with the noble lord that in this case there was so much support for the bill that the other place was ready for it to go through without debate <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may intervene i think my noble friend has left the question of access and i hope this is a convenient pause between subjects because i wish to thank her for giving an indication of the timetable but i had one other question concerning northern ireland <e> <s> the noble earl lord mansfield said that this would be extended to the whole country <e> <s> this bill does not extend to northern ireland <e> <s> so is my noble friend able to give an indication of whether the government will take an early opportunity to consider that fourth part of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate my noble friend on his sturdy defence of the bill and for the painstaking explanations which he has given as points have been raised <e> <s> most of the controvery

secretaries of state for scotland <e> <s> i must record that i did speak on second reading and i did also speak at the committee stage <e>", "<cs> i should like to welcome straight away the clause that my noble friend has moved on behalf of the government <e> <s> no doubt some questions will be put about parts of it but very briefly i should like to take up the general point which my noble friend has made because i know that a review is taking place to bring about improvements in the orange badge scheme <e> <s> improvements certainly are needed because as she has said there are abuses and the abuses can be carried out very easily because the badge remains on the car even though a disabled person is not using it <e>", "<cs> if i may intervene i think the noble baroness has made a very good point and i do not think we are in disagreement <e> <s> i think people in her situation should have some sort of sign on the back of the car for that kind of difficulty <e> <s> but that has nothing to do with parking and the parking problem has to be dealt with by the orange disc <e>", "<cs> for the severely disabled but not for everybody else <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies

scottish bill which has been passing through the house also has application because we are discussing with amendment no <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> in which the government propose quite a large new clause which has the heading <e>", "<cs> as it is a new clause i would just raise an editorial point which no doubt the noble baroness lady masham will take into account <e> <s> if this new clause does not apply to scotland then there ought to be something added at the bottom of it to say that this section does not apply to scotland because in the form of the bill at present clause of the bill simply says <e>", "<cs> it would be less than civil of me not to express gratitude to the government and to my noble friend for moving the new clause <e> <s> as she has recorded a new clause was added to the local government miscellaneous provisions scotland bill which has just been enacted <e> <s> i was responsible for drafting and tabling the new clause in <e>", "<cs> my lords while appreciating what my noble friend has done and is doing in trying to promote peace in the middle east will he take the opportunity of the forthcoming british presidency of the eec to try to make further progress in getting the eec and the united states together to urge a solution <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for the very clear way in which he outlined the bill and its purposes <e> <s> i wish to address myself to two of the subjects subjects with which i have been involved the first being the new proposals for the education of handicapped children and the second the assisted places scheme and the position of grant-aided schools <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there might be further applications for use of small aircraft of this kind by those who would wish to be able to watch the tennis without having to hear some of the language used by the players <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may just say a word because the noble lord referred to the international year of the disabled and i am the chairman for scotland of the international year in fact the only representative from the four parts of the united kingdom who has been a member of both houses of parliament <e> <s> of course the noble lord is right in saying that the system of benefits is extremely complicated for disabled people and i am one of those who have been advocating a rationalisation and simplification but let us remember the reason for it <e> <s> it is that the national health service and the national insurance system when they first came in simply did not apply to a large number of very severely disabled people those for example who were born disabled or who became disabled in early youth because if you had never worked or been available for work you were not in the national insurance system <e> <s> you did not even <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to my noble and learned friend whom i felt sure would give this proposal a very sympathetic ear <e> <s> being very practical

been put for gibraltar and the whole house will accept the britishness of gibraltarians and their loyalty to the united kingdom <e> <s> but i am one of those who is concerned about another overseas dependent territory namely hong kong <e> <s> i am worried about the effect there if some special exception were made for gibraltar <e> <s> for both gibraltar and hong kong the people concerned do not expect a right of abode in the united kingdom automatically in the future <e> <s> neither can they expect to become independent <e> <s> i will not pursue in detail the reasons where hong kong is concerned it is a matter of the relations between this country and the peking government which are of immense importance in the balance of influence in the world influence so far as the soviet bloc and the western alliance are concerned <e> <s> if hong kong could become independent there is no doubt that it would have no difficulty in governing itself efficiently and well and in continuing as a leading industrial state in the world <e> <s> but independence is not possible for hong kong and it is not possible for gibraltar in the case of hong kong for reasons of history and in the best interests of the united kingdom and the western alliance <e> <s> only about half of the population of hong kong are now citizens of the united kingdom and colonies and would therefore under the bill become citizens of the british dependent territories <e> <s> in general they do not seek a right of abode in this country nor i understand do gibraltarians seek an immediate and automatic right of abode in this country <e>", "<cs> i have just said my lords that there are more gaelic speakers abroad than there are welsh speakers <e> <s> if welsh is to be in the bill therefore then gaelic should

lord i am grateful to him for giving way that he could go to nova scotia and other parts of canada where he would find thousands speaking gaelic <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that having moved the amendment i have a right of reply and i should like to use it first to thank the government for having considered the arguments and accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords i can understand the reasons why my noble friend lord geddes has moved this new clause <e> <s> it is a new way of bringing together the three forms of citizenship proposed in the governments bill <e> <s> the governments original scheme

"<cs> my lords will the government both within the eec and outside the eec take a lead in encouraging action in view of two serious problems first that the soviet union has clearly withheld supplies on which poland has had to rely being part of the east european bloc and secondly that poland has already accumulated a massive burden of debt to the west <e> <s> is it not worth taking great trouble

year of work and therefore being especially relevant to school-leavers <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his reply <e> <s> is he aware that some organisations representing disabled people are very worried at the prospect of the abandonment of the quota in spite of the fact that the quota of per cent <e> <s> has in practice become a target only rather than an obligation <e> <s> does my noble friend agree that one of the main problems has been that many disabled people seeking work have not wanted to be registered <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend ensure that the consultations being carried out are very wide and that enough time is given for bodies representing the disabled employers and trade unions to put forward their views <e> <s> because one hopes that a better scheme than the quota scheme can be produced but many people will need to be convinced that it is a better one <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply as regards timing which i am sure will be helpful to the industries concerned <e> <s> in those cases if any where the government are considering the abolition of a training board will they give the industry concerned the opportunity and the time to suggest alternative arrangements for training <e>", "<cs> my lords in regard to what the noble lord lord wallace has said will my noble friend agree that this is a good moment for a review of all the arrangements even if no change is made <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful

easily removable and are only in place on the windscreen of a car when a disabled person is using that car <e> <s> the interests of severely disabled people are now being damaged by an erosion of confidence in the parking system <e>", "<cs> my lords on that same point has it yet been decided whether police and traffic wardens can take action when they check and find that the person whose name is on the badge is not using the car <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend agree that it is important to try to speed up public inquiries and their results both north of the border and south of the border <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by thanking my noble friend lord mansfield for having introduced so clearly what is a long bill with many different subjects in it <e> <s> i would have raised some points which the noble lord lord ross of marnock has already dealt with some of the principal points in the bill in drawing attention to them in the way that he has he has shortened my speech by about half <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank my noble friend lord elton for having introduced this bill and explaining it so clearly today <e> <s> the bill aims at reforming the law in england and wales applying to mentally disordered people who need special protection and control <e> <s> i welcome these proposals to improve safeguards for those people for example to provide greater opportunity to appeal against continued detention <e> <s> that is an area where there has been some public concern <e> <s> i also hope that in future it will be more clearly

consultation and thanking my noble friend for his reply i hope that these designations can be made before too long <e> <s> in the meantime will the government ensure that no proposed new building such as a shop or a pub can evade the tests now required <e> <s> is he aware that this legislation is the result of recommendations made by the bodies which have been considering the problems of access for disabled people and that it will remain a very tangible legacy of the international year <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the original clause which was accepted by the government having been moved by me this summer asks the government to designate a body <e> <s> therefore it is expected that these will be existing bodies and so it will not be necessary for a new body such as a quango to be instituted <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could explain again to my noble friend lord drumalbyn that as i said at the beginning the purpose of my amendment is exploration <e> <s> i am hoping that the government can indicate whether there are other subjects which might be brought into this general system <e> <s> that is why my wording is not of the best as the noble lord lord ross has pointed out

tackle <e>", "<cs> it might help my noble friend if i raised one certain point at this early stage about the activities which as the noble lord lord ross of marnock has pointed out are dealt with in this short clause <e> <s> two of the activities are to be mandatory so far as licensing is concerned and one of these is public entertainment <e> <s> i suggest that clarification will be needed at some stage during the bill perhaps later in our proceedings to indicate what public entertainment really covers because there is some anxiety at the moment that it would extend to such functions as

frontiers to foreigners has had the effect of stopping food and other essential supplies from voluntary international sources <e> <s> if that is the case will the government do their best to maintain essential supplies to poland during the winter because this could not possibly be regarded as intervention in the internal affairs of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question

pearson royal commission on having made this debate possible today and i join in the admiration of the lucid way in which he introduced it <e> <s> i myself see much in favour of the proposal to introduce a no-fault compensation scheme but i also see some drawbacks in the particular proposal in the commissions report <e> <s> some of these have been mentioned by previous speakers so i shall

whiting and grenadier which frequent deeper water than other stocks and which can be caught normally only by new methods and not the traditional methods of fishing <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government ready to make adjustments in future so that there is more emphasis on benefits and services made available to severely disabled people who are able to live in their own homes rather than in hospitals or institutions since this is more cost effective and also much better for them since most of them want to be as independent as they can be <e>", "<cs> has not the debate on this amendment

take out an important clause of the bill <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross of marnock asked the question where in scotland is there a hospital where you could not get a doctor within six hours <e> <s> that is not the point <e> <s> the clause allows up to six hours <e> <s> the question should have been where is there a hospital in scotland where a doctor cannot be produced within two hours or one hour <e> <s> i can tell him straight away in my area of northern scotland and i can supply him with information on such cases <e> <s> it would be invidious of me to mention names but having been involved with the mental health side of things in northern scotland over more than years i am aware of hospitals in that area where there have been anxieties because of patients wishing to leave of course of their own will but making it clear that they were likely to go and commit suicide or be a danger to the rest of the public <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will permit me to interrupt my lords because he has misunderstood me and i wish to correct him <e> <s> i pointed out that it was not within six hours six hours is the time in the bill <e> <s> half an hour or one hour is the sort of period in question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend who has clearly given hard thought to this matter <e> <s> i moved amendments in committee to what is now clause <e> <s> i sought to delete the shortening from seven days to three days <e> <s> my noble friend is tackling the same problem in a different way and changing the provisions for the later clause which prescribes what should happen after the action in clause <e> <s> in so far as he has made it easier for the medical profession and those who have the task of transporting patients in the more remote areas of scotland this i am sure will be welcome and they will be grateful for this improvement in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i used the wrong expression <e> <s> i certainly welcome the present administrations efforts to save money <e> <s> i should have <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for what my noble friend has been able to say at this stage <e> <s> i welcome his statement that the secretary of state intends to carry out full consultations because am sure that those in the medical profession who are concerned with these latest forms of treatment which are regarded as hazardous will hope that they will be fully consulted and able to present their views before the regulations are decided upon <e> <s> i agree that as the negative procedure was apparently left in the bill for england and wales which was passed last year it would perhaps be not very wise to put this into the scottish bill <e> <s> i did take part in the consideration of the english bill at various stages and i spoke on this subject at the second reading <e> <s> but i did not myself think of intervening to the extent of putting down this kind of amendment when the english bill was before the house <e> <s> i rather wish i had now <e> <s> i have the feeling that the reason that nothing happened was that nobody else actually thought of doing it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord winstanley for reminding me of those proceedings which i was following at the time although i was actually taking part in the earlier stages <e> <s> i think that my noble friend gave the impression that the regulations for england and wales are not yet tabled but he said that the scottish office had a target for about the end of for the regulations for scotland <e> <s> i am sure we are grateful for that estimate <e> <s> otherwise there was nothing to indicate how long the process was going to be before we were going to see what was in the regulations <e> <s> i certainly have no intention of pressing the amendments and i beg leave to withdraw them <e>", "<cs> my lords i also am grateful to my noble friends private office for having sent an explanation because of the late tabling of this new clause which i was able to see at a very late stage and therefore only a few hours before it came up this evening <e> <s> i understand that there is similar provision in the bill for england and wales passed last year so i would simply ask my noble friend whether the time has been spent consulting those who are concerned with this matter both on the legal side and on the medical side to try to find the best formulation for this new clause <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend suggested that amendments nos <e> <s> and might be discussed at the same time <e> <s> they clearly also follow the principles he has explained amendments nos <e> <s> and are government amendments to government amendments which were made at the committee stage <e> <s> as those amendments were made at the committee stage to meet amendments of mine i should say that the wording which my noble friend has just explained is much better than the original wording in the bill <e> <s> so far as i am concerned i am content with the redrafting which my noble friend has now done and i would remind your lordships that my original intention which the government met was to give discretion to the doctor as the bill was originally drafted it seemed very restrictive because it tied down so closely the other persons whom the doctor had to consult <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend for the way in which he introduced the bill and explained it to us at its various stages <e> <s> i should like to thank him especially for his willingness to amend it <e> <s> some of the amendments changed the bill from the form of words which had been used in sections in the equivalent legislation passed last year for england and wales <e> <s> amendments have thus been made to meet the scottish situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all who have taken part in this short debate <e> <s> my noble friend lady lane-fox managed to come back in time and i was delighted to have her support <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill took a clear view as he has before about the need for a rear badge which would have nothing to do with parking <e> <s> i would say to my noble friend who replied for the government that i too simply referred to it for clarity because there may be a case and i am not demanding it myself for a badge on the back to indicate that there is a disabled <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate my noble friend on introducing this bill and i thank him for his explanation of it <e> <s> as he and i think other noble lords who have spoken will know i have on several occasions in recent months been pressing for a measure of this kind to be introduced by the government <e> <s> i believe that action is now essential <e> <s> there are over of these ex-spanish vessels now registered at different ports in the united kingdom including some ports in scotland <e> <s> by masquerading as british they have been making absolute nonsense of the european communitys fishing agreements <e> <s> not only have they <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not necessarily need a reply this evening because this is complicated but in replying to my point about ireland which is the best example my noble friend said that the irish government would probably be introducing an equivalent measure <e> <s> but that will be concerned with irish registered boats <e> <s> we will still have a situation where a spanish vessel which appears to be and is theoretically registered as a united kingdom vessel because it still will be a united kingdom registered vessel is doing things within irish fishing limits which the irish government think that it ought not to be doing <e> <s> presumably the complaint will then come to us <e>", "<cs> the amendment which the noble lord lord john-mackie has moved would have the effect of delaying an order laid under this bill for three months and i would ask what will this achieve <e> <s> i doubt whether it will do very much good for those for whom the noble lord lord john-mackie has been pleading the case <e> <s> when the expected order comes into effect whether in april or in may as i certainly hope or three months later these ex-spanish boats will have to modify their fishing plans <e> <s> they have already had plenty of time in which to prepare for this as i will explain <e>", "<cs> it certainly sounded as if he had fallen into that trap because he quoted mr laing as talking about trawlers which of course was his business <e> <s> but of course the inshore fleet the fleet fishing in european waters now is made up not only of trawlers but seine netters herring boats and other kinds of fishing boats as well <e> <s> it is because of the very trend to which mr austin laing referred the fact that our distant water fleet has been so much reduced that there is unemployment in our fishing fleet as a whole and many of those men have had to turn to the inshore fleet and fishing in those waters which are the eec pond <e>", "<cs> it looks as if the noble lord is about to withdraw the amendment a course which i welcome <e> <s> as it is a committee stage i have another opportunity of speaking <e> <s> i wish simply to deal with the point which the noble lord made concerning what i said <e> <s> i spoke at a little length today because i thought that it was important to make it absolutely clear why the people who are acting in this way with these ex-spanish boats have had plenty of notice <e> <s> they have known since they started that at any moment their operations would be stopped by the british government <e> <s> but in case it seems that i have not made that clear even in the amount of time that i used today i should like to reply to what the noble lord has just said <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that full reply <e> <s> is he aware that many observers are under the impression that these two bills do apply to scotland and that this is not surprising when a bill is entitled the national heritage bill <e> <s> much of the national heritage is north of the border <e> <s> will the government consider possible remedies <e> <s> for example every scottish bill has the word scotland in brackets in its title <e> <s> could not the word england or the words england and wales be similarly included in titles in appropriate cases <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind the amount of time which was spent in the last parliament on debates and bills on devolution is it not important to take every opportunity of making clear when there are already devolved arrangements in scotland for legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend conceive of any reason why those attending cnd demonstrations should object to being photographed by anyone including the press british or foreign <e> <s> presumably they do not mind being seen to have attended such a demonstration unless they are photographed carrying out something illegal or disorderly <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that as regards caravan sites there are extraordinary anomalies as between scotland and england and that i supplied his right honourable friend with comparative figures some months ago showing that two sites only a short distance apart but on each side of the border were treated very differently <e> <s> does he recognise that this is a serious handicap to the tourist industry in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether the government will make every effort to ensure that a certain residential property in the public sector not far from here does not become vacant even briefly in four weeks time <e>", "<cs> my lords while there arc always some conditions and constraints attached to being within the organisation and discipline of the armed forces is it not true that there are nonetheless considerable attractions for medical officers <e> <s> will the government extend more widely information about the opportunities which are available for those who possess the necessary qualifications <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his reply <e> <s> i share his regret that the culprit has not been traced on this occasion when many sea birds suffered a miserable death <e> <s> can my noble friend say whether the system of matching oils is yet precise enough to obtain conclusive evidence against a particular vessel <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in this case it was fuel oil and not crude so that it could have come from almost any kind of craft <e> <s> will the government promote the development of the system of detection as well as the system of matching oils <e> <s> this could be a powerful deterrent against practices which foul our inshore water and our coastline <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to make provision for disabled persons and to establish a commission having the functions of considering certain matters concerning the treatment of disabled persons and of making recommendations <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble earl lord longford for he has enabled us to have a debate on this subject <e> <s> he has explained his bill very clearly despite the trouble he described with his voice i can assure him that he came through very clearly indeed <e> <s> his sincerity is there for all of us to see and he did pilot the act through your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble earl for interrupting me for the very good reason that i cannot stand for very long <e> <s> when i was in another place everybody knew that in particular those members on the other benches <e> <s> every three or four minutes they interrupted and asked me to give way and i was quite glad to do so except when it came to some of the very difficult questions that they then put to me <e> <s> but as i say i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> i was simply putting to him a point which i thought he might have dealt with when he wound up the debate <e> <s> however i am obliged to him for dealing with it straight away <e> <s> it means he confirmed this that there is quite an area where discretion is left to the secretary of state in any case <e> <s> but i foresee difficulties because what will he regarded as discrimination by some people in particular those who are affected will not to others seem such a reasonable case <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble viscount sits down may i ask him one very quick question to which i think other noble lords may like to have the answer <e> <s> the noble viscount gave a very interesting description of the device he uses himself <e> <s> can he give any indication of the cost today of such devices <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble viscount my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend agree that while some progress has been made over the years towards reaching international agreements and conventions for dealing with oil and trying to prevent oil pollution and slicks very much less has been done concerning the carriage by sea of toxic substances such as this <e> <s> will the government do what they can to prompt action in the international organisations including what used to be called imco now called imo the international maritime organisation with headquarters in london <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord ross of marnock for reminding us of that occasion <e> <s> i am reminded of other occasions on which he also made brilliant speeches on that bill <e> <s> the speech to which he referred introduced the element of being drunk in charge whereas this does not <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord caradon on his good fortune in the ballot and on his most eloquent speech <e> <s> he described graphically to us the origins of the united nations declaration and then the convention which has been negotiated <e> <s> speakers in the debate so far have made it plain that the part of the convention on the deep-sea mining regime is the most contentious subject which has been under negotiation <e> <s> this briefly is dealing with the resources of the floors of the oceans beyond the continental shelves and beyond individual nations claims such as in exclusive economic zones of -miles <e> <s> we are here dealing with the high seas and international waters <e>", "<cs> my lords my memory certainly does not go nearly so far back as that of the noble lord lord shinwell but i remember that the macbrayne monopoly was broken during the early s while i was secretary of state <e> <s> is not the principle of ret being abandoned many people thought at the time that this principle ought to be fully examined because when applied to some sea journeys and some distances it means that less financial help would be given than would be made available under the existing system <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i think that it would be convenient if i spoke now to indicate what my intentions have been in the bill <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord kilmarnock was speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and as well as to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i see that his first two amendments which would have the effect of making the commission larger are in fact related to his third amendment which requires that at least four members of the commission be disabled persons <e> <s> i have no difficulty in accepting amendments which would make the commission a bit larger <e> <s> as i think your lordships know my intention had been that the commission should be small and inexpensive <e> <s> a number of the objections which were raised on second reading and <e>", "<cs> i was not suggesting that it would not be possible to have four disabled members <e> <s> the secretary of state may be able to appoint six or eight members who are disabled persons <e> <s> i just say that in certain circumstances the provision might be restrictive <e> <s> there is nothing to stop the secretary of state from appointing a commission every member of which was a disabled person <e> <s> but the restrictions might mean that in certain circumstances he could not achieve the best possible combination of talents and experience <e>", "<cs> i should be very happy to accept that <e> <s> as i have indicated i should be happy to put down an amendment at report stage in the terms of that of the noble lord lord kilmarnock but with the figure two rather than four simply because once the provision is in the bill it has to be followed <e> <s> but there is nothing in the bill to stop the secretary of state from appointing four or more disabled persons if in his opinion that seems to be the sensible thing to do <e>", "<cs> this point really comes up under clause but i entirely agree with the noble baroness lady masham that there would certainly have to be at least one member of the commission and probably more than one who among other things had the legal knowledge to help the commission <e>", "<cs> if i may just recapitulate i am pefectly happy to accept amendments nos <e> <s> and which is the point that the noble earl lord attlee has just been speaking on and i just have this reservation about putting in the fixed number of as much as four in amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> well i make no further comment on that at this stage <e> <s> i am not surprised that the noble lord lord ennals should be taking this line because he was a distinguished secretary of state for social services and he knows how much there is to be done in that department and no doubt he considers that this responsibility should lie there <e> <s> but certainly in the second reading debate there were voices which suggested that the responsibility should lie with the home secretary in preference to the secretary of state for social services <e> <s> but the secretary of state for social services was my first choice and indeed my amendment was put down in order to bow to what seemed to be overwhelming opinion of another kind <e>", "<cs> the question of the bill not extending to northern ireland which i propose to explain when we reach the relevant amendment involved a financial matter covering the question of pensions and benefits when in fact they were in the bill <e> <s> but that situation will not continue since i hope that my amendment to extend the bill to northern ireland will be passed when we reach it <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for raising this point for clarification <e> <s> i think that it would be useful if at this stage i indicated the purpose of the bill <e> <s> i am perfectly willing to listen to views and to make changes <e> <s> what occurs to me immediately is that an amendment which might be more suitable and which could be tabled for the report stage would be one that proposed that the deputy chairman and one other member of the commission should be full-time particularly in view of its enlargement <e> <s> i should like to suggest that the chairman should not be tied to being a full-time member <e> <s> it leaves the option open for securing the best available person and the widest choice <e> <s> as the noble baroness has indicated there is nothing to stop it the word may is there <e> <s> the chairman could be full-time but there are technicalities which arise about full-time and part-time when members are appointed to commissions of this kind <e> <s> they have to give up all directorships partnerships and other occupational and business interests <e> <s> when that happens it eliminates some of the most suitable of the people who would otherwise be available especially the younger ones <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could just say something first on clause stand part <e> <s> i see the noble earl lord longford rising but i simply want to indicate that i am perfectly willing as a result of representations that have been made to me and also because of what was said in the debate i think by my noble friend lady lane-fox that ones mind should be open to the possibility of some existing body doing the job that is now set out for the commission and thereby not have to establish a new commission <e> <s> certainly some misgivings have been expressed about bringing into existence yet another new commission <e> <s> i should point out that in the bill the commission is a small and inexpensive body even though it has been slightly enlarged by the amendments we have just made <e>", "<cs> i should like to reply very briefly to the points that have been raised <e> <s> the noble baroness lady masham raised a case concerning employment <e> <s> in my opinion in that type of case if the person accused had legal proceedings brought against him he would undoubtedly get off with a good lawyer even with an adequate lawyer because he would be able to plead various other reasons for not having employed the person concerned <e> <s> the commission proposed under the bill is limited to investigating reporting and the reports would be to parliament and to publicising because the reports would be public <e> <s> it does not try to bring the person concerned to a court but in my opinion it would be more effective <e>", "<cs> thank you <e>", "<cs> i was aware that it was installed i think as a result of the incident to which i referred <e>", "<cs> it would perhaps save time if i spoke immediately <e> <s> for myself i see no difficulty about accepting this amendment but in reply to the noble baroness lady darcy who moved it i must explain that subsection <e>", "<cs> as regards subsection that is what i was suggesting but not clause <e> <s> clause is an important clause which requires the secretary of state within one month to place before parliament reports which would be made under what is at present paragraph <e>", "<cs> on clause stand part that was a voice from the opposition front bench that i was glad to hear in favour of dropping subsection which is what i was asking for opinions on <e> <s> i shall certainly be tabling an amendment to take out subsection at report stage <e> <s> the noble baroness lady masham asked me a question about functions of the commission which i said would be more appropriate for clause stand part but i think i answered her question when she raised the case concerning employment <e> <s> therefore i do not think that we need pursue that again <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness lady masham for having raised this matter <e> <s> i remember her noble kinsman the late lord swinton and i would regard his advice as very wise advice but in these situations i have often received legal advice which conflicts <e> <s> it is a good thing to have a definition in some cases but in other cases it is much better not to have a definition where the subject is a difficult matter to define <e>", "<cs> as there is nobody speaking to the schedule may i simply thank all who have taken part in this committee stage and made such contributions to improving the bill <e> <s> may i say to my noble friend lord glenarthur that i hope that when the final version appears after all this assistance it will commend itself to the government <e>", "<cs> my lords as there has been some confusion on television programmes and elsewhere about this can my noble friend confirm that while the annual rate of flow may reach its maximum during the s oil is expected to be produced from our continental shelf for at least years provided that there are incentives for developing new fields <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for this support <e> <s> i am also grateful for the message from the noble earl lord longford <e> <s> the noble earl told me himself that he had to leave <e> <s> he and i have both been piloting through bills with different approaches but i am grateful to him for his general support for my bill <e>", "<cs> my lords as it is clear that copies of the manuscript amendment are not everywhere available i think that it would be helpful if i simply read out exactly the words which are changed <e> <s> the change occurs in paragraph ii and the new words are <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend for introducing the bill so clearly at the beginning of this debate <e> <s> scotland had already started on the road to giving ministers powers to curb excessive expenditure by local authorities before the rest of the country and before this bill was introduced in another place <e> <s> i remind your lordships that four scottish local authorities were last year the subject of reports to another place resulting from a system of guidelines and direct discussions between the local authorities and the scottish office <e> <s> this bill now goes further <e> <s> for example clause seeks to arrange that several local authorities can be included in one report to another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e> <s> i should like to say a few words at this point <e> <s> first may i thank all those who have participated during the various stages of the bill in your lordships house <e> <s> the suggestions which many of your lordships made during those debates have led to changes all of which i regard as <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the whole house would wish to thank the noble lord lord ezra for having raised this subject and for introducing it in the way he has <e> <s> i believe he has attempted the almost impossible and has i suggest succeeded that is to say he has spoken on the subject of long-term strategy in a short-term debate <e> <s> we are <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend give way as he very kindly referred to me <e> <s> i would agree that it is exceedingly difficult to make forecasts about reaching self-sufficiency <e> <s> after all we hope that we shall be out of recession and there will be a great deal more demand for energy in years to come so that is a very difficult estimate to make <e> <s> will my noble friend also take the point because he has given the figures and referred to the recent increase in exploration that the next stage is the stage of decisions on investment which are the really important ones where our continental shelf is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i seek to take part in this debate in order to express concern about clause <e> <s> therefore i shall address myself only to <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ennals has spoken to several amendments and i for my part believe this to be a satisfactory way of starting on clause <e> <s> he also made much of the lack of consultation which many of us thought had taken place when the bill was first published but which we all went into on second reading <e> <s> i shall try not to make a second reading speech on that point <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble earl will give way as he kindly referred to me at the beginning of his comments <e> <s> i have also been sent a copy of that case <e> <s> i think that it proves my point <e> <s> there is no assessment for a lady of that kind now or if there is it is only a narrow one for certain purposes whereas if the system which is a starting point for this scheme comes into force she will probably qualify <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should come in again <e> <s> i think that that is the difficulty <e> <s> if there had been more consultations they would have realised what per cent <e> <s> disablement under the war disablement and industrial injuries assessments consists of and how that was likely to be applied to these other cases <e> <s> personally i think that the anxieties that have been raised about that case are probably wrong <e> <s> as i tried to explain in my intervention if the scheme is brought in on the basis of the kind of assessment which i and others have to go through then of course she would be in it <e>", "<cs> just before the noble lord <e> <s> lord ennals rises may i say that i am most grateful to my noble friend because he has replied to many of the points particularly ones that i have raised about the way in which the proposed per cent <e> <s> assessment will be carried out <e> <s> i noted particularly that he reassured all those concerned about the question of periodical reassessment and also that there are powers which the government already possess in legislation which would enable them to adapt and add to the criteria for assessment <e> <s> in view of the fact that we have been taking so much time on this bill it may be agreeable to the committee to know that because of the answers which the minister has already given i am not proposing to move amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> there is a rule <e> <s> of which he is probably unaware that it is not correct in this house to quote from a member in another place in the current session unless he is a minister <e> <s> the previous quotation was not of a minister and i think that the noble lord is about to embark upon another quotation of somebody who is also not a minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend lord kinnoull as have other speakers for initiating this debate <e> <s> the civil aviation authority report raises a very important issue for the future of the british airline industry over perhaps the next years <e> <s> i agree in principle with their general argument <e> <s> however i regard their particular recommendations for routes and services as useful suggestions rather than as a precise formula for application <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his reply <e> <s> the white paper records an arrangement for an exchange of services to saudi arabia and south america between two airlines <e> <s> do <e>", "<cs> my lords in pursuing the praiseworthy objective of privatising british airways will the government continue to take special care so that damage is not inflicted on the existing private sector of the airline industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his reply <e> <s> the negotiations are clearly taking longer than had been expected <e> <s> can my noble friend confirm todays reports that

and definite agreements on the important outstanding issues even if this means postponement of the date of accession <e> <s> while we look forward to the entry into the community of spain and portugal to paper over differences by reaching an ambiguous settlement would only store up trouble for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his reply <e> <s> the common fisheries policy agreed by the existing members of the community was concluded with great difficulty only last year and it is to last for years <e> <s> is it the governments intention not to reopen that agreement but to make additional arrangements for the very large spanish fishing fleet bearing in mind that this is one of the most important issues for britain arising from spains accession <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that his reply to my supplementary question is most satisfactory and will be welcomed by fishermen throughout britain <e> <s> are the government concerned that the community pond might be returned to a state of uncertainty and confusion if last years hard won agreement were to be upset or undermined and that it would also lead to a serious loss of opportunities for the british fishing industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all grateful to my noble friend lord nugent of guildford for having drawn attention to this recent draft circular and bringing to our notice in your lordshipshouse the important matters with which it deals <e> <s> i believe that they need to be widely understood and then handled with care by the authorities both government departments and local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether there is any record of

corner has been out of action for about a year and that is on the main line to heathrow <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government obtained the full agreement of the other members of the eec to the aim stated by my noble friend lord belstead in his replies to me in this house last october <e> <s> he said then that the common fisheries policy should not be re-opened having concluded with great difficulty and being intended to last for many years <e>", "<cs> my lords as the notes issued by the three scottish banks are legal tender south of the border have the government arranged perhaps through the bank of england for an increased production of these notes <e> <s> because there is no doubt that if the present plan is carried forward a great many will be brought south of the border

seriously deficient in certain respects <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to join in supporting the proposal of the noble lord lord henderson and especially so as its intention appears to be similar to that of the bill which i introduced in the last session of parliament the disabled persons bill <e> <s> i would remind your lordships that i accepted some amendments which were proposed during the passage of that bill and that it passed through all its stages in this house with the goodwill of all sides and also with the goodwill of organisations outside parliament <e> <s> it did not find time

intervene for a moment from this side of the house <e> <s> my noble friend is now making a point which the noble lord on the opposition front bench made that is that it is better to have a policy adopted than have something which is uncertain <e> <s> if in a certain area the majority of the electorate happen to want a middle-of-the-road policy are they not entitled to have it even if it is

join it for the inquiry a compliment because i had received the same invitation or co-option four years ago when the subcommittee last carried out an inquiry into fisheries <e> <s> i can only presume

given admirable answers to a whole range of questions on many subjects <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter raised the question of costs and i feel that i must make a brief intervention

because it is a very easy operation whereas the money saved by the national health service will be millions and that money could be put to another use within the national health service <e>", "<cs> i was interrupted by my noble friend <e> <s> i would simply add i do not intend to repeat any second reading speeches that i was referring to the money which would be saved in the attendances at dental

exists above <e> <s> i wanted to ask whether he was intending his remarks about the dangers of that amount of fluoride in the water to apply to the natural supply <e> <s> if i understand correctly what he has just said it is that there may be elements such as calcium in the natural water supply which somehow counteract the dangerous qualities <e> <s> that is my understanding of what he has just said <e> <s> therefore what he is saying he is not intending to apply to natural supplies of water <e> <s> am i right <e>", "<cs> i would agree with the noble lord that that is possible but of course the reverse is equally true <e> <s> people who have been living in an area with the optimum amount of fluoride in their water naturally and who have to move because of the need to find other employment or for any of the other reasons which have made our population much more mobile now than they used to be to another area may find an inadequate supply of fluoride so far as concerns their teeth <e> <s> it works the other way as well and it would be much fairer to that part of the population if the water in the place they move to was also fluoridated to the one part per million which

lords as the may day holiday is usually found to come close to the easter weekend and as there is also the spring bank holiday will the government consider dropping the may day holiday introduced only

lord burton whose home is near mine in northern scotland and where we enjoy sparkling highland water which contains a due amount of fluoride <e> <s> it does not contain quite the one part per million

to make sure that my noble friend does not propose that amendment no <e> <s> dealing with the prohibition of drift nets should be discussed now <e> <s> i believe i am correct in thinking that <e>",

to be discussed now cover forms of nets besides the rod and line provisions in my noble friends own amendment to be used in the firths and the mouths of rivers but not at open sea in salt water <e>

wales <e> <s> i had understood that it had been intended that some other amendments including the second amendment in the name of my noble friend lord burton there being two amendments numbered as a result of an error on the marshalled list would be considered with this amendment <e> <s> if that is so it is important because it is a question of whether we have a debate on all these amendments involving scotland together <e> <s> i should like to speak on this in any case but perhaps we could have this clarified first <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may continue with my speech on that and these points will no doubt be answered in due course by the noble lord lord moran <e> <s> what i am proposing to do and i think this is appropriate is to go back to the very first drift netting which occurred round the british isles which was in scotland as i was a junior member of the government at the time in the early s <e> <s> it is very relevant to the whole question of banning drift netting round our shores which is what the noble lord lord moran is suggesting <e>", "<cs> may i clarify a point <e> <s> my noble friend has just mentioned the national federation <e> <s> i have objected to them about their name because they represent a certain number of fishing organisations in england and wales but none in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that satisfactory reply <e> <s> will the government do all that may be necessary to dispel any idea that an apparent surplus of crude oil

country a matter of the highest priority <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for her reply which is reassuring but because almost all the radiation to which the population is exposed apart from that in the natural environment comes from medical sources is it not highly paradoxical that

about per cent <e> <s> less in its effect upon the population <e> <s> both the medical processes and the industry are beneficial in purpose and are needed <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord

how volatile the world price of crude oil can be and are therefore ready for contingencies such as the difficult ones produced by the present situation should not policy also include other energy industries in particular the coal industry which may feel most acutely the present collapse in oil prices <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government taken fully into account the opinion of the cbi and

and current in curbing inflation is seen as being greater than we had thought <e>", "<cs> my lords in case there should be any doubt about my purpose in raising this question is my noble friend aware that i have complete confidence in the advisory committee and that although there is this comment in the report about there not being a full reflection of the expenditure of less well-off households

"<cs> my lords as this bill leaves your lordships house i should like to draw attention to two points <e> <s> first this is the first new legislation for building societies for about years <e> <s> previous acts have been virtually re-enactments of earlier arrange-ments <e> <s> secondly the bill with cautionary and prudential provisos enables building societies to carry out new functions which will promote competition in markets and enable them to carry out more services for the public <e> <s> that is for the benefit of the general public and their convenience <e> <s> i remind the committee that it has been estimated that about half the adult population of the country is a saver or a borrower with a building society so this is a measure which really does affect the general public <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend suggest to london regional transport that it should put large notices outside stations where the escalators are not working so that those who cannot go for long distances down steps know that it is not worth going down <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for her reply <e> <s> it is disappointing that little progress appears to have been made <e> <s> for more than a year now my noble friend has had to give more or less the same reply <e> <s> will the government now try to accelerate the proceedings or take another initiative <e> <s> fishing fleets of many other nations have been sailing long distances to plunder the riches of those seas without any control <e> <s> even argentina now appears to have reached agreement with the soviet union and japan <e> <s> unless some action is taken soon there will be few fish left to protect <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the residents of caithness have lived beside a prototype fast-breeder reactor for years and that the majority of them do not want to see the nuclear industry reduced in their area and that the tranquility in these matters has been disturbed recently only by the appearance of a radioactive cloud emanating from the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> as it is seven years since the government made that last gallant attempt and years since a judge in court said that it was high time that section was pensioned off is my noble friend aware that there is immense credit awaiting the administration which succeeds in carrying out this reform without reducing national security <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that despite the difficulties in that debate seven years ago everyone who spoke appeared to be in favour of doing away with the catch-all section in accordance with the recommendation of the franks committee and that such criticism as there was from all parts of the house front benches and back benches was constructive <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for her very agreeable reply <e> <s> is she aware that the new powers available to building societies can make such co-operation more fruitful and that the countrys economy would benefit from the greater mobility which will be made possible for people whose jobs require them to move from time to time <e> <s> the right to rent would be assisted in addition to the right to buy <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that encouraging reply <e> <s> is he aware that following the energy act new generating machines have been operating most successfully using this new resource but that they have then been assessed for rates at unexpectedly penal levels <e> <s> will the government give urgency to the examination of assessing a system which surely ought to be encouraged <e>", "<cs> my lords in examining this matter will the government bear in mind that although it is on only a small scale at present it is a system which is free from pollution and saves fossil fuels <e> <s> as the noble lord has mentioned ilfracombe is he aware that the cases which have come to my notice have all been in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that visits by soviet vessels bring income and business to this country arising from services <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in glasgow there are now buses in search of waiting passengers which is an exact reversal of the situation which has been the experience until recently in most cities <e> <s> is this not a welcome change for most of the public <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there is a high proportion of aids cases in the edinburgh area where the disease is being spread by drug addicts who are sharing needles or syringes <e> <s> have the government any plans to deal with this serious risk bearing in mind that it is the scottish office that is responsible for health in scotland and not the dhss which is my noble friends department <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that very satisfactory reply <e> <s> as the first application of this method appears to have been very successful attracting the willing help of the public including that of parents of possible offenders are the government satisfied that the equipment required is within the means of the police forces concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that many of us will warmly welcome her statement today because the previous policy of the government although well-intentioned was taking much too long <e> <s> in the meantime the long-distance fleets from far away such as japan and the soviet union were making serious inroads into the stocks of fish in that area <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the proportion of electricity generated from nuclear power stations is considerably more at present in scotland than in england and wales and that the risk of unemployment would accordingly cause great anxiety in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> does he agree that these changes were essential to retain britains position as a major financial centre and serving still industry and investors as efficiently as possible <e> <s> but are the government satisfied that the breakdowns which took place last week in screen systems and the delays in settlements were teething troubles only <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his reply <e> <s> is he aware that within years this ingenious operation has come to the relief of many who would otherwise be severely handicapped or in pain largely thanks to the dedicated work of the late sir john charnley and others <e> <s> do not this and other new and expensive forms of treatment add substantially to the costs of the national health service in a way which was simply not anticipated in the s when the health service was being introduced <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend confirm that it is correct to say that at the time of the beveridge report it was thought that the cost of the national health service would decrease because the nations health would improve <e> <s> is it not correct that in the event medical and scientific advances have introduced new treatments and operations requiring very expensive equipment <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there is one decision that could be taken without delay <e> <s> that relates to the spread of aids by drug addicts <e> <s> while it is repugnant to appear to be giving any encouragement to the use of drugs will the government now enable needles to be made available free because the need to curb the spread of aids at this stage is of overriding importance <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that reply which shows a remarkable trend <e> <s> is he able to confirm the impression that many of the new investors in companies take a personal interest in both the good management and the success of the companies concerned <e> <s> does he agree that this is a healthy development for the british economy <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend give an absolute assurance that far from the government dragging their feet wherever else lead may be detected in the environment there is no lead in their boots in their steady advance towards an unpolluted atmosphere <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> however is he aware that the tax in question light dues is levied on merchant shipping but not on other categories of vessel which also benefit from these navigational aids and that some neighbouring countries that compete with our ports and shipping raise the costs of lighthouses from general taxation <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that that means there is a temptation to shipping to go to rotterdam and other ports nearby rather than to our ports <e> <s> also is he aware that he has not mentioned the royal navy or other ships owned by the government which do not have to pay these dues <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the only debate which took place on the loss of the sister ship the motor vessel derbyshire was the debate initiated by me in this house on th may <e> <s> concern was expressed at that time about the possibility of defects in the hull <e> <s> however the only common fact appears to be that both vessels were carrying iron ore will my noble friend take into account in the inquiries the investigations which the minister who answered at that time promised would be made into the loss of the motor vessel derbyshire <e>", "<cs> my lords have the soviet government provided any information about adaptations which would correct the faults in design that helped to cause the chernobyl disaster in those reactors of the same type which are still in operation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply and i should like to ask him this question <e> <s> will not the replacements have to be coal-fired or nuclear stations since renewable sources such as tides and wind cannot make the necessary contribution to electricity supplies <e> <s> is he aware that <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that the first generation of nuclear stations has served this country extremely well with significantly few incidents or casualties <e>", "<cs> my

telephones in rural areas are tempting to thieves and vandals but that these are the telephones which more than most are needed by local communities <e>", "<cs> my lords further to the question put by the noble lord lord mishcon is my noble friend aware of a case in point which is the phone box near my home in a rural area of northern scotland that clearly had been attacked with nothing less than a crowbar and the whole coin box removed <e>", "<cs> my lords our gratitude is due to the noble lord lord jenkins for having raised the question of accountability of the security service which is an important subject <e> <s> we have to ask ourselves how best to balance the need for some basic secrecy with the proper supervision of such a service in a democracy <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to congratulate my noble friend on introducing the bill which will take the situation a step forward in england and wales <e> <s> i agree with what the noble lord lord harris said about scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords for the benefit of those of us who have not followed this subject in detail can my noble friend give an indication of the number of recent cases in which there has been mugging of

asking for an indication of the number of muggings occurring against staff on ward duty as mentioned in the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for her reply <e> <s> in their estimates for the future do the government visualise that the treatment of most of these patients will be carried out in a special ward of the kind about to be opened at the middlesex hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government taken into account the cost of additional staff required in hospitals to treat these cases and the cost of preparing and equipping the hospitals to ensure complete safety against infection from blood and cut accidents <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that welcome reply <e> <s> but are the government prepared to introduce new factors to be applied in assessing full rates for this novel kind of installation <e> <s> a test case such as the one at ilfracombe which was mentioned in reply to my previous question a few months ago cannot do more than interpret the

designated or notified to the european community and following what the noble lord lord carmichael said about some of the beaches being imperfect is my noble friend aware that nonetheless there are many clean sparkling and unpolluted bathing beaches in scotland which also excel in not being overcrowded <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble and learned friend aware that i have been one of those in this house who for some years has been advocating the replacement of section of the official secrets act and spoke in favour of the governments own bill in to replace the act before it was withdrawn

extremely unwieldy and would almost certainly lead to duplication and unnecessary expense and that the building societies are in future likely to play a substantial part in financial services <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that in the case of the three acronyms used each has been spelt out one in my question one by my noble friend and the other in full by me <e>", "<cs> my lords

was set up under the chairmanship of the late lord wheatley who besides being a distinguished judge was a keen follower of football <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mishcon has with his usual clarity explained very carefully the variations in this new amendment as compared with the one we discussed in committee <e> <s> i had already examined it in detail and i understand what the noble lord is trying to do <e> <s> i recognise the effort that has been made to meet arguments that were put in our previous debate <e> <s> however i must say that i do not believe that the changes meet the main arguments and objections which were raised in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a harm test as regards the subject of the security and intelligence <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall proceed to our discussion in the previous debate <e> <s> at that time the noble lord lord jenkins of hillhead argued that a form of public interest defence had existed in the notorious and unloved section of the act <e> <s> he suggested in his speech on that occasion that my right honourable friend the home secretary was trying to ride two horses <e> <s> he has given himself i believe two much more difficult and dissimilar horses to ride at the same time in doing away with section which is abominated by everyone i do not believe there is anyone in your lordships house who would wish to retain it but also in claiming that part of section a has <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that there is very much between us <e> <s> i am simply pointing out the situations which could occur in the security world where deception has to be part of ones daily work that could not occur in any other world <e> <s> i hope very much that that is the kind of case which the staff counsellor will deal with <e> <s> however i am not an expert on that subject and i shall wait to hear the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down he is quite right to talk about the home civil service <e> <s> i should like to clear this matter with the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> with amendment no <e> <s> we are discussing eight other amendments including the new clause amendment no <e> <s> which is the operative one <e> <s> the other amendments would apply that new clause to the other clauses <e> <s> therefore it would cover all civil servants <e> <s> clause applies in particular but not totally to security and intelligence services <e> <s> in our discussion i was speaking to the amendments to the other clauses also <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all grateful to the noble and learned lord who introduced the amendment which he did most helpfully <e> <s> he explained that it is another approach to the question of prior publication and that it differs greatly from the one we discussed in committee <e> <s> i believe that a word has been missed out <e> <s> i hope that i can have the attention of the front benches because i hate the thought that the noble and learned lord missed my compliments <e> <s> the problem that my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter pointed out will be corrected if the word services is inserted at the end of the last line of the amendment <e> <s> i believe that it has been omitted as a drafting or printing error <e> <s> if that is not done the word the in the previous line is out of place <e>", "<cs> i shall address myself to the amendment on the basis that the word services has been omitted <e> <s> i agree that the amendment deals with two of the points that i raised in committee <e> <s> it deals with the case of an unscrupulous person arranging for something to be published in an <e>", "<cs> my lords i made that suggestion in respect of publication abroad but not in this country where something can be stumbled upon <e> <s> as i said i have come across such an example in the past <e> <s> that is why i cannot give any indication of the type of thing that can be stumbled upon <e> <s> many years ago when i was involved in such matters i saw one or two cases where something had been stumbled upon by chance but because it was unnoticed in some minor newspaper no damage was done <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down and as i have already spoken and would not want to offend against the rules on report i should make it clear that i was in the usual way one does in the house accepting that two of the points that i raised in committee were met by the amendment <e> <s> however i would not go so far as to say that all the ingenuity of the front bench opposite would be able to produce something that i could accept <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may raise a question of procedure <e> <s> when the noble lord moved the very first amendment today he did not say that other amendments would be grouped with <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord home said that this amendment was almost identical <e> <s> i believe it is exactly identical to the previous amendment no <e> <s> which was discussed in committee <e> <s> i understand why it is being put forward again because this is a matter of great concern to historians and writers <e> <s> in my view however i do not think that it is necessary to write it into the bill <e> <s> it is past and present practice for proposed books memoirs broadcasts and articles to be cleared beforehand <e> <s> if this is now put into the bill in this form it could cause some confusion by inserting something which is already practised <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord who has just moved the amendment pointed out we had a great deal of discussion on a very similar amendment in committee <e> <s> we note the change which the noble viscount has made to the wording <e> <s> however i believe that the overriding consideration should be that responsibility for the security service must remain and must clearly be seen to be with ministers <e> <s> i believe that in previous debates most noble lords were agreed on that <e> <s> a review body

mission <e> <s> is the minister aware that a recent manifestation of <e>", "<cs> my lords some of us including clearly the noble lord lord mackie thought that we heard the noble lord lord hatch of lusby state during his supplementary question that there are million people in scotland <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that the total population of scotland is about million <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> until decisions are taken on the griffiths report will the government ensure that the rate of closures does not overtake the necessary provision of care in the community for patients suffering from serious mental illness <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his reply <e> <s> will the government give high priority to reducing the scope for abuse <e> <s> the interests of disabled people will suffer if the scheme falls into disrepute <e> <s> in particular the badge should be easily removable and should be in place only when the vehicle is being used by the disabled person <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend confirm reports that other containers of lindane were on board the transporting vessel which later sank on the north side of the channel <e> <s> if that is correct will there be an inquiry into the suitability of this transport and the action which was taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> when the government decide to allow irradiation which many countries already allow clearly regarding it as safe and effective against bacteria will they insist on strict regulations to prevent it being used as camouflage for substandard food <e>", "<cs> i should like to say very briefly that i do not think that this amendment is necessary although i do not know whether my noble friend will accept it <e> <s> however i am always against including in legislation any provision which is likely to restrict the governments choice of the most suitable best and available person for a position <e> <s> indeed one cannot always foresee who the candidates may be <e> <s> i should be most surprised if the person eventually appointed does not have experience of the electricity industry <e>", "<cs> i had intended to say that <e> <s> they are only a small part of the generation but nonetheless that is an important element for the very reason which the noble lord gave when he said that it is not otherwise possible to store electricity <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> line of page states <e>", "<cs> yes it is <e>", "<cs> i am very glad that the noble lord who has just spoken agrees with my assessment of what the minister has said in reply <e> <s> i am grateful to all those who have taken part in this short debate for their comments and for their support for the principle of common tariffs in the area of the north board <e> <s> as i said at the beginning my purpose is simply to probe and to receive a statement from the government which we have had <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his reply <e> <s> is he aware that the campaign in this country on behalf of deaf drivers was won in the early s at the time of the international year for disabled people when examination of the figures proved that deaf people do not have more road accidents than others <e> <s> do we now have to launch another campaign <e>", "<cs> my lords in these negotiations i wish the government well can it be pointed out that a radio in a vehicle playing loud pop music renders the driver as incapable of hearing sounds outside that vehicle as if he were deaf <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that encouraging reply <e> <s> however will the government encourage the establishment of a complete system throughout the country under which retired refrigerators would not be broken up thereby releasing cfcs into the atmosphere <e> <s> instead could not those cfcs be recycled or safely disposed of as necessary action to protect the ozone layer <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government do their best to inform the public that the insulating foam and the coolant in refrigerators are perfectly safe while they are sealed inside the refrigerator <e>", "<cs> my lords quite apart from my noble friends statement the other day because there is so much radioactivity in the sea anyway can my noble friend reassure us that this low grade radioactive waste which was disposed of there has made any difference <e>", "<cs> i shall start by saying that the wording of my amendment was bound to be imperfect it was an amateurs draft which was aimed simply at making the intention clear <e> <s> i am most grateful to all members of the committee who have taken part in this short debate <e> <s> i am especially grateful for the support which i have received from my noble friend lord renton <e> <s> of course i agree with him that situations differ and again my drafting is at fault because i used the word identical <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for that intervention <e> <s> i have been at home during the past week and i have been bombarded by papers from british telecom telling me about the new scheme for northern scotland <e> <s> so far as i have been able to read it it seems that it will be helpful for the area <e> <s> if the government are prepared in due course to take a similar view of the new supply of electricity in the area after the north board that is a good sign <e> <s> at this point i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for her reply <e> <s> while no doubt this link has been most useful in helping at peak hours can my noble friend confirm that the electricity received at this end has been cheap bearing in mind that about per cent <e> <s> of the electricity generated in france comes from nuclear sources much of it from pwr reactors <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his reply <e> <s> in dealing with this diabolical substance which is new to this country will the government take into account especially the inner cities <e> <s> it is there that the easiest markets will exist in the eyes of the drug traders who hope to make fortunes and who in the united states have been using children as their street peddlers <e>", "<cs> i understand the purpose of the amendment which my noble friend lord norrie has moved <e> <s> the bodies which he has named and at least one other which the noble lord lord williams has named and perhaps others which have not been in touch with me have expressed their great concern as to whether the terms of the bill do enough to protect the environment in future <e> <s> this is not a question of whether one is for or against privatisation the main purpose of the bill it is simply a question of whether in changing the legislation one is doing enough to protect the environment or whether more is needed <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend on the front bench replies i should say that i do not think that the government need at this stage comment on an amendment passed a few days ago <e>", "<cs> i am extremely pleased with that reply and i am grateful to my noble friend for having seen the point and saying that he will consider it <e> <s> as regards the wording of the amendment i simply accepted the drafting which came to me and i do not know how much expertise there was in it <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the support which has been given to the amendment by all speakers during this debate <e> <s> i am very glad that my noble friend lord sanderson said that he proposes without commitment to discuss the situation with the new company in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his reply <e> <s> i do not wish to suggest any more legislation than is clearly necessary but is he aware that theft and wilful damage can be committed from a distance with impunity by sophisticated hacking <e>", "<cs> i should like to add to a point on this clause which has only been touched upon <e> <s> in debating the amendment the noble baroness lady turner gave us a quick description of the origin of the national insurance scheme which is based on the beveridge report <e> <s> my noble friend lord renton gave us the benefit of his experience on the standing committee in another place in <e> <s> both drew attention to the fact that what lord beveridge and his colleagues were considering was everything to do with employment <e> <s> the scheme was based on whether or not a person was in work <e> <s> only people who were in work or available for work were contributors <e> <s> benefits were mainly for people who lost work or had retired <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> it is good news that a settlement may be near but what action can be taken to restore the situation <e> <s> can he estimate how long it will take to eliminate the present delays because the holiday plans of thousands of citizens are still at risk <e>", "<cs> my lords has my noble friend observed on his way to the home office the long queues stretching round the block from the passport office in petty france even at am <e> <s> that is tangible evidence of the frustration and anxiety now being caused <e>", "<cs> my lords is a neighbourhood watch scheme any help against the sudden unannounced arrival of about people in the neighbourhood who then indulge in a party lasting all night and use drugs <e>", "<cs> that is not right <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> has he seen reports that the public are still being extensively deceived over mileage figures by unscrupulous dealers <e> <s> is there any way of stamping out this malpractice other than by insisting on complete records which can be checked and by imposing severe penalties <e>", "<cs> in general it is a great pity that at this stage of the bill we should have an issue to discuss without being able to make any change <e> <s> over the years i have become familiar with all the problems of private members bills introduced in another place <e> <s> i was lucky enough when i was in the other place in ballots and other ways to introduce bills and with the help of friends in your lordships house to get those bills through <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord harris of greenwich continued on the point i made earlier but if i may say so has not quite understood the point i was making that the bill is coming so late to this chamber <e> <s> fortunately in most cases private members bills come to this place in time for us to make any necessary changes and there remains time for the bill in the other place <e> <s> i want to make that clear <e> <s> it is because the bill has come here late that we are in this position <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his reply <e> <s> it would be uncivil of me not to applaud also the lead taken by my noble friend lord caithness at the basle conference in march immediately after a debate in your lordships house on a motion of mine <e> <s> since time must elapse before that convention can enter into force because ratifications are needed will the government seek from now to act within the provisions of that new basle convention <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government also consider carefully the views expressed by environment ministers and others attending the international conference at the headquarters of the international maritime organisation in london last week <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that reassuring reply <e> <s> while the rapid expansion of salmon farming has brought benefits to remoter areas may i ask whether my noble friend is aware that if this warning is supported by further evidence the matter could be extremely serious <e> <s> this applies particularly to scotland where wild salmon make a notable contribution to local economies especially local government finances through the rating system <e>", "<cs> i should like to say something about the reference to scotland because we in scotland have been paying the personal community charge since april <e> <s> the point raised by the noble lord has already come to my attention <e> <s> i quickly say that on my small estate i have six properties which are let furnished and that from st april the rents of all those properties were reduced by me by exactly the amount of the domestic rates which i paid in the previous year <e> <s> the tenants knew that that had happened <e> <s> whether the local council office supplies or is prepared to supply information as to what are the rates in individual cases i do not know <e> <s> i should not mind at all if the tenants were to check with the highland regional office in inverness which is the appropriate one to make sure that the rents were reduced by the correct amount <e> <s> however my tenants are all quite grateful <e>", "<cs> the noble lord referred to me <e> <s> i was hoping simply to add to the knowledge <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his reply <e> <s> i recognise the special problems in devising designations which clearly indicate the parts of the united kingdom which are affected <e> <s> is he aware that many people in scotland were misled into thinking that the national curriculum and therefore also the education reform bill would apply to schools in scotland and that the media have also experienced difficulties <e> <s> i have with me an article from a daily united kingdom newspaper describing the rivers authority several times as applying to the whole of britain <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend accept that the point i am raising is not one of pedantic criticism but that the public in scotland one-tenth of our population sometimes misread apparently casual designations as meaning that scotland has been overlooked <e>", "<cs> my lords in the case of one of the places the noble lord has mentioned it is always called the national gallery of scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords in considering these figures is it being taken into account that some lending institutions including the largest building society in this country arrange for borrowers to even out rises in the mortage rate by paying identical monthly payments during a subsequent year and so delaying the impact of the change <e>", "<cs> my lords was not the reason for the change in that the government felt it was right to produce a level playing field for banks and building societies <e> <s> therefore the composite rate was applied to banks as well as building societies <e> <s> however might not a better solution be to do away with the composite rate altogether <e> <s> that would still keep the playing field level <e>", "<cs> my lords without going into the merits or demerits of the case where the ec rights of establishment and participation in capital have been invoked if the european courts decision were to enable fishing boats to change their nationality at will and with ease how could the quota system be continued <e> <s> that system was the basis and still is of the common fisheries policy and was the result of long and arduous negotiation <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble and learned friend who will know that the scottish law commission had already reached the same conclusion and prepared a draft bill <e> <s> as other countries have been legislating in that field does not the united kingdom risk losing valuable business when robberies on a massive scale and destruction of records can be perpetrated without entry into premises and in most cases apparently without breaking the law <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble and learned friend may recall that when i raised the subject at question time in the summer i accepted the need to restrain the amount of legislation coming forward <e> <s> that appeared to be echoed in your lordships house <e> <s> does he agree that a bill on this subject is unlikely to be political or contentious and need occupy only a limited amount of parliamentary time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> however like me he will have seen the reports in scotland which show that that figure is not very dissimilar from the number of people in years past who had not paid their domestic rates by this stage of the year <e>", "<cs> my lords i took part in the debate at committee stage on a similar amendment <e> <s> i should like to ask noble lords on the opposition bench this question <e> <s> am i not right in thinking that there is a misprint in line of

kind words that he said about me at the end of our last debate <e> <s> at committee stage i offered some information from experience in scotland where the community charge has been in effect for just over six months <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall continue for a while and then give way because i shall refer to the noble lords earlier comments <e>", "<cs> my lords i still believe that it is difficult

year in which there would be a change <e> <s> the point must arise when one changes from one system to another <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for explaining the order <e> <s> i also

ships do adequate arrangements for monitoring rivers exist in all the countries concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> is he aware that in scotland the standard charge is imposed from the day after a death before relatives are able to go through personal possessions or dispose of furniture <e> <s> is he further aware that what was thought to be a set charge on second homes when the legislation was <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that his announcement that there will be a code on both sides of the border from april is welcome <e> <s> however is he also aware that <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for her robust reply <e> <s> does she agree that the preparation of this traditional british delicacy is different from practices in other countries but is not a danger to health <e> <s> is she aware that she will have the wholehearted support of many members of this house in her bid to save the british banger <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the present situation seems to be bringing to life an episode from the television programme yes minister in which the british sausage was threatened <e> <s> will she comment on rumours of an equally serious threat to the haggis <e>", "<cs> my lords on the question of ramsar sites which are wetlands internationally arranged for the benefit of birds will the government do everything possible to help to keep confidential the site where the crane has this spring come to breed in the united kingdom for the first time for many years <e> <s> does he agree that whether that site is in scotland or in another part of the united kingdom it is best that we should not know <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his reply <e> <s> can he say whether enough is known about the present numbers of this reclusive but remarkable bird or about the factors which are tending to reduce its numbers <e> <s> is he aware that the capercaillie became extinct in scotland and was reintroduced successfully in <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his answer <e> <s> while it seems that most trouble will be caused by industrial disputes abroad is it not bad news for british holidaymakers that they are likely to have to spend many hours delayed in great discomfort at airports <e> <s> are there channels of communication with neighbouring countries by which routes can immediately be rearranged or similar alternative measures taken <e>", "<cs> my lords will the system adopted on th april by european transport ministers enable controllers in one country to direct aircraft flying over it and landing in another <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that answer from which i conclude that a conscious attempt is being made to reach parity with similar countries <e> <s> why is there a shortage of applicants from the united kingdom when the remuneration should be rewarding enough with the tax benefits <e>", "<cs> my lords can the government make it clear that career prospects in the british public service will not be impaired by a period of service with the commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord carmichael for having tabled the amendment because it is the equivalent of two amendments which were tabled in my name at the committee stage <e> <s> because of the postponement of the committee stage by over a week i was unable to be here to move them <e> <s> i informed everyone concerned at the time why i could not be here and i owe an apology to the house but i was asked to leave the amendments in my name on the marshalled list so that they could be discussed in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to make a few comments and also ask a question on this matter <e> <s> going back to the days before the reform of the licensing laws which took place in the s and started in with the clayson committee there was more than a suspicion that clubs had been set up for the purpose of drinking <e> <s> they were not <e>", "<cs> my lords will this situation not be similar to those in other fields which have been handled over many years both on the tweed and solway by scottish and english bodies working closely together <e> <s> can the minister confirm that the national rivers authority which despite its name functions in england and wales is now co-operating with its scottish counterparts on both the tweed and the solway <e>", "<cs> my lords arising from the last question does the minister agree that the key to these matters is that every government decision on the environment in scotland is taken by the secretary of state for scotland and that any attempt to try to subtract powers from the secretary of state for scotland at present would be entirely unrealistic <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> as the armed services of most countries are in a good position to carry out monitoring and surveillance in relevant areas without significant additions to their normal functions can he say what are the prospects for fruitful co-operation especially now with the soviet union and eastern europe against this worldwide menace <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that i buy anything that i need on sundays without the shops concerned breaking the law because my sundays are spent at home in scotland where there are no restrictions but sunday is nonetheless special and in my area the churches are full <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend clarify a matter arising from the wording of the question on the order paper <e> <s> is not more damage done by the removal of the forests which absorb carbon dioxide through chlorophyll in their leaves rather than through the production of carbon dioxide in the process of burning <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for his reply <e> <s> there seem to be differences of opinion among the industrialised nations on the institutional arrangements <e> <s> but is it firmly agreed that assistance is necessary if the developing countries are to be persuaded to take special measures which were not in the past required of other countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i note that scotland is also included in this question <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that some suitable schemes carried out in places where they will not obtrude on the environment enable sea defences to be renewed against storms and flood sewage treatment works to be improved and the dereliction of our coast to be repaired <e> <s> is my noble friend further aware that those measures enable private finance to be introduced to help where public funds from both central and local government are either scarce or not available at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not speak in our two previous debates on the subject <e> <s> however having read them in <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his answer <e> <s> will the recent report from the european court of auditors help <e> <s> that drew attention to particular incidents <e> <s> is it possible to ensure that prosecutions are not started without supporting evidence so that they do not collapse like the case last month at winchester <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> the mailing preference service has as one of its sponsors the royal mail <e> <s> as it makes tolerable the multiple posting of junk mail should its existence not be more widely known so that people can be spared such mail if that is their wish <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that among the approaches now being received by the mailing service are requests for more direct mail for example from people in rural areas for direct mail catalogues <e> <s> therefore in several ways the service can be of benefit to the public <e>", "<cs> this amendment raises matters conveniently at an early stage of the committee on which i should like to seek clarification <e> <s> they concern drafting and interpretation <e>", "<cs> perhaps there has been some misunderstanding <e> <s> my noble friend said that his intervention was based on what i said <e> <s> i was not commenting i was merely saying what the facts and the functions are and showing how the bill has been drafted <e> <s> to my knowledge those arrangements have certainly existed in scotland for well over years and probably much longer <e> <s> bills have been drafted with those functions and parliament expects the various secretaries of state to answer to parliament for the sectors for which they are responsible <e> <s> it is a little difficult in a single bill to upset that constitutional division of functions <e>", "<cs> that is in england and wales <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> is he aware that japanese scientists among others have warned that one species of porpoise is threatened with extinction <e> <s> does he agree that extra international measures are now needed to protect marine mammals <e>", "<cs> my lords the international conference in holland to which my noble friend referred takes place this week <e> <s> will the government support a deliberate ban on hunting porpoises and dolphins as well as pressing for disincentives to catching them in ordinary fishery drift nets <e>", "<cs> with leave before we start perhaps i may call attention to a defect in the marshalled list <e> <s> it is one of some importance <e> <s> i refer to amendment no <e> <s> zka <e> <s> it is attributed to three names one of which is mine <e> <s> it is certainly not our amendment <e> <s> it seems that a name or names has been omitted from above the amendment <e> <s> some of us would like to know whose amendment it is <e> <s> it is due to come up in the second debate <e> <s> if the information is not available immediately perhaps by raising it now i shall give time for the information to be given to us <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is proposing a countryside council but clearly it will cover nature conservation <e> <s> indeed subsections c and d indicate that <e> <s> the amendment aims to replace the governments proposals which are to be added to by their amendments proposing four bodies including the joint committee <e> <s> i should prefer to build on what exists already and on the functions of ministers and their departments which parliament has laid down <e> <s> i entirely understand the spirit in which my noble friend tabled the clause as an alternative <e> <s> however i do not believe that its provisions would fit in easily with many statutes which set out the duties of ministers and their departments <e> <s> the governments bill which we are now considering does not affect those duties <e> <s> that was confirmed by the minister when i raised that point on the first day in committee <e> <s> this amendment enables us to make a few general comments on part vii at the beginning of our discussion <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble lord lord mcintosh for having grouped so many amendments together and having explained so clearly how they come together <e> <s> it means that we can deal with the subject of the setting up of this joint committee in one debate <e> <s> it is necessary that there should be a joint committee <e> <s> its purposes broadly are first co-ordination within the united kingdom and secondly to handle where necessary international matters <e>", "<cs> perhaps my noble friend will give way <e> <s> i may be able to help <e> <s> no doubt the minister will be able to confirm what i say but the term area of outstanding natural beauty appears in scottish legislation <e> <s> scotland does not have legislation for national parks <e> <s> in bringing all the various terms together it is no surprise to me that that term should appear <e> <s> that may help my noble friend <e>", "<cs> we have already heard from the chair that the amendments are marshalled in the wrong order <e> <s> can the matter be clarified <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may add my voice here in regard to what has been said by the noble baroness lady nicol <e> <s> the proposals have been considerably added to and changed <e> <s> during the course of todays discussions we have encouraged and welcomed them <e> <s> therefore the situation is not the same <e> <s> i for one am satisfied that the government have taken on board the fact that extra money will be necessary <e> <s> i do not expect the government to give exact figures today <e> <s> if they tried to do that we might end up with less than we need <e> <s> therefore it is not necessary to press the government for exact figures at this stage <e>", "<cs> it sounded as if my noble friend on the front bench was prepared to accept the first two amendments in which case i had hoped that they would be moved <e> <s> i understood that the third one was unsatisfactory <e>", "<cs> while my noble friend prepares his reply perhaps i may add my voice <e> <s> the right to petition is very widespread in this country <e> <s> so far as i know and my noble friend may confirm this individuals have that right <e> <s> clearly there has been some doubt as to whether those bodies come direct to a select committee of parliament for opposed private legislation or whether they come to the department of the environment <e> <s> it would be best for the matter to be cleared up <e>", "<cs> surely that part of a hybrid bill which is considered to be private legislation is normally treated in exactly the same way as a private bill <e> <s> i hope that there is no doubt on that score <e>", "<cs> i should like some clarification of amendment no <e> <s> to which the noble lord lord mcintosh referred <e> <s> it is clear that there are three misprints <e> <s> he stumbled on one but county councils is referred to three times <e> <s> i am sure that it is meant to be country councils <e> <s> it is important because if it were county councils it could not apply to scotland <e> <s> there are no counties in scotland <e> <s> the equivalent of a county council in scotland is a regional council <e> <s> before we continue with the debate that should be made clear <e> <s> i hope i am right in thinking that in each case where county councils appears it should read country councils <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask for clarification on how many amendments we are taking <e> <s> from my copy of the grouping list it looks as though there is an indented second line which includes amendment no <e> <s> zac in the name of the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey <e> <s> i want to be clear whether we are taking a group of two lines as appears in the grouping list and whether that includes the official opposition amendment <e>", "<cs> while my noble friend is considering that point perhaps i may say that i am glad the noble and gallant lord lord carver pointed out that the amendments which stand in his name and mine are relevant to this group <e> <s> therefore they are being discussed with the group which starts with amendment no <e> <s> c <e>", "<cs> the committee will recall that i have tabled questions and taken part in <e>", "<cs> i said that i expected an answer at some time during todays committee stage because it was rather a fast ball <e> <s> however it is a rather important point <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for producing that answer so quickly particularly as she is dealing only with a specific section of the bill <e> <s> it makes clear what i guessed might be the case member state refers to ec membership and other member states of the ec <e> <s> however that is not stated in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that encouraging answer <e> <s> should not the gas be used as a fuel wherever practicable not only in order to save energy but also because it is dangerous and has caused explosions and is a prominent greenhouse gas <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that reply <e> <s> while the phasing out of cfcs is highly desirable are they not still essential for refrigeration <e> <s> for example they are required for bulk perishable cargoes at sea in order to prevent other forms of pollution and food poisoning <e>", "<cs> my lords while destruction and disposal of cfcs must be carried out under strictly controlled conditions will my noble friend confirm that cfcs used correctly in refrigeration are not harmful while in use provided that there are no leaks <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble baroness will give way for a moment <e> <s> i was a member of the committee and i shall be speaking later <e> <s> she is at the moment speaking about the response of the secretary of state for education and science relating to england and wales <e> <s> foreign languages have already been introduced as an experiment in primary schools in scotland a subject about which i shall be speaking <e>", "<cs> my lords i most warmly congratulate my noble friend lady brigstocke on her brilliant maiden speech <e> <s> she was head of a school whose outstanding academic reputation she helped to build the success of which is reflected in the contented comments of parents <e> <s> for eight years she has been a most distinguished governor of a school where i was educated <e> <s> i quickly add that my education there took place many years earlier <e> <s> we all look forward to hearing from my noble friend lady brigstocke often in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend will recall that i raised various points at question time concerning the standard charge and the interpretation of the second homes legislation for scotland <e> <s> does he agree that the solutions which were found after a year of the poll tax the community charge in scotland have led to a great improvement in the situation since st april for england and wales <e>", "<cs> my lords i have two propositions to put forward <e> <s> the first is that war involving the west in the gulf need not happen <e> <s> the second is that it would be wrong to renounce the use of armed forces in any particular circumstances beforehand <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask two or three questions about what is intended and the meaning of the drafting of the amendment <e> <s> those questions arise from the fact that in a bill of this kind wherever the words the secretary of state appear they apply to any secretary of state <e> <s> the noble lord lord mcintosh has rightly pointed out that large numbers of ministers in many departments are involved in protecting the environment <e> <s> nominating junior or senior ministers for that role may help and we hope that they will be concerned about the environment even if their main duties lie elsewhere <e> <s> my point concerns mainly ministers who have specific functions <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to say that i am most grateful to him for dealing with that point straightaway <e> <s> it is important to the whole discussion of the amendment <e> <s> what he said and said very concisely at the beginning in his reference to clause is what i said at length and pointed out at least twice during the committee stage <e> <s> we both used almost the same words to point out that several secretaries of state had to work in different parts of this bill <e> <s> however in every other part of the bill it is clear how the convention of our drafting will be carried out <e> <s> it was not clear until the noble lord told us a moment ago how this would operate in the new clause <e>", "<cs> my lords on report one cannot speak again and therefore i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> the point about that executive is that the department of employment covers great britain <e> <s> the secretary of state is responsible for scotland and wales <e> <s> that was one of the reasons for the difficulty about bringing in the pollution side of the matter to which the noble lord lord ezra referred <e> <s> as regards pollution the secretaries of state work in their own different countries and have complete responsibility given to them by parliament for all decisions in those <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his reply <e> <s> nonetheless do the government agree that where these risks arise doctors and nurses must be protected from what could be very bad effects <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords may remember that i was one of the first people to put down a question on haemophiliacs about a year and a half ago <e> <s> i received a very good answer <e> <s> the question today is on an entirely different subject <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that patients or their families might raise an objection when asked for their consent before a test was made <e> <s> in those circumstances in my opinion the surgeons and nurses should come first <e>", "<cs> my lords the authoritys area of operations includes the estuary as well as the river <e> <s> the firth of clyde has deep sheltered water near land at hunterston <e> <s> it is all within the authoritys jurisdiction <e> <s> i am personally glad to support the bill because years ago i took the planning decision as secretary of state which enabled hunterston to become a deep water port and enabled the ore terminal to be built which has since supplied the steel works at ravenscraig <e> <s> a year after my decision ravenscraig was accepted as one of the principal steel making centres in the united kingdom and appropriate resources were invested there <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for her reply <e> <s> is she aware of recent cases in the united states where salmonella poisoning has been traced to that source <e> <s> since salmonella has been a growing problem in britain are the government ready to restrict or stop the traffic in these creatures if cases of salmonella poisoning occur in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether the situation is made any more difficult by the fact that turtles are now becoming popular fiction for young people which may increase the demand for such creatures <e>", "<cs> my lords i too thank and congratulate my noble friend lord cranbrook on the way he chaired the sub-committee which led to the report with its wise recommendations and also for his clear introduction to that report at the beginning of the debate <e> <s> i was not a member of that sub-committee <e> <s> i venture to speak because i have raised points on tropical forests in question time and debates which i have initiated in the past two years <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point made by the noble lord but the replanting need not necessarily be in the same place <e> <s> one hopes that replanting will be possible <e> <s> where it is not we must of course try to retain the trees for as long as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend informs us that she has only been able to put all the decisions together today <e> <s> i accept that <e> <s> it is helpful for those of us who have put aside the whole of today in order to consider these important amendments and the new clauses much changed as a result of the committee stage to receive a general statement at the beginning which my noble friend has given <e> <s> that is certainly helpful to me <e> <s> i cannot comment on what did or did not happen last week but i believe that my noble friend is being helpful to everybody who will be taking part in this report stage until probably a late hour this evening <e> <s> she has made a general statement now at the beginning of the debate and i hope that the house will accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may comment on one point that the noble lord lord chorley raised <e> <s> he made the general remark that the scots were against the establishment of a joint committee <e> <s> there may have been some of such opinion but there were other views <e> <s> as one of the members of the carver committee the subcommittee which went to edinburgh for two days and took evidence from a number of organisations my recollection is that some of the people from whom we heard may have had difficulties about the establishment of a joint committee but most of them accepted it <e> <s> i must make that clear for the record <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has clearly explained the amendments which stand in his name <e> <s> the intention is to widen the functions of the new councils in comparison with the present functions of the ncc in relationships with the public <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i am in favour of the principle but as i said i was not sure that the government would not find the objections which my noble friend lady blatch did in fact produce <e> <s> in principle i hoped that my noble friend realised that i thought that if it were possible to encourage good relations with the public in the field one should go on exploring ways of doing it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for her reply which shows that action is being taken <e> <s> is she optimistic that a recurrence can be prevented so avoiding losses by fishermen resulting from another government ban on the sale of shellfish to the public <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say what co-operation is being sought from other european countries in view of the fact that plagues of algae have occurred elsewhere in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say to my noble friend that i am sorry but i have to sit forward on my seat in order to be able to stand <e> <s> however i was listening to my noble friend with great interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for referring to what i said <e> <s> however as a matter of accuracy perhaps i should point out that i was asking for information rather than suggesting that the proposals had not been thought out <e> <s> in fact i actually said that i presumed that the opposition spokesmen had thought them out <e> <s> i shall be interested to hear about this in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his reply <e> <s> is not the total figure that he has given the highest ever recorded or near to it <e> <s> is it not correct to say that the government hope for an even higher figure with the help of current training schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> are the government satisfied that britain is doing as much as other western countries with the objects first of giving crucial support to the economies of certain eastern european countries and secondly of increasing our international trade <e>"]
