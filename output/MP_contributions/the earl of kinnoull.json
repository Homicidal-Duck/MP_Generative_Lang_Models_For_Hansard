not support but at the moment stage hypnotism acts almost always take place in clubs <e> <s> it is this form of control that this bill is seeking to provide for <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt again but i think the noble lord said that he had found no local authority which had exercised its power to prohibit a stage performance of hypnotism <e> <s> if he were to ask the glc he would find that they have a general rule i do not remember its number but i spoke with them yesterday that as a matter of policy does not allow stage hypnotism in theatres except for charity

late <e> <s> i should have insisted on my right to take it at an earlier stage because it would have been fairer to the house in judging whether or not this bill should receive a second reading <e>",

thanking my noble friend for that very helpful information may i ask whether he is aware of the now considerable concern at the protracted timing and high legal costs involved with these voluntary public inquiries over the provision of additional terminals at major london airports <e> <s> is my noble friend further aware of the anxiety expressed over the rapidly diminishing capacity at heathrow which i understand has dealt with over million passengers in this last year while it awaits the outcome of the fourth terminal <e> <s> what has happened to the inspectors report <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend advise us whether the british airports authority have power to have given themselves permission for a fourth terminal without a public inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the house is always grateful to the noble viscount lord simon for spotting what may be loose and superfluous phrases in bills <e> <s> as he said he raised this point in committee and i then promised to investigate this mystery of why it was necessary to emphasise the word living in the phrase living person <e> <s> as the noble viscount said the schedule to the bill is lifted out of the act but of

explain that following certain amendments during the passage of this bill it has been reduced considerably in size <e> <s> there are however certain points that have been raised following the amendments by those concerned outside <e> <s> these will be examined with care and taken up in another place by my honourable friend mr david crouch <e> <s> i am grateful for the interest and attention which this house has given to the bill <e> <s> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords it is never easy to cross swords with the noble baroness on subjects of consumer interest and airline interests one particularly remembers her great fight over the check-in facilities at the west london terminal <e> <s> the noble baroness knows her subject and i agree with very much of what she says except the point that the house agreed the principle that the industry should pay for this security charge and that of course is what the regulation is based on <e>", "<cs> my lords having the great honour of being the last on the list of speakers in this debate tonight i am glad to advise the house that i shall be very brief <e> <s> i should like to add my congratulations to my noble friend lord trefgarne for the very able manner in which he introduced this long and interesting debate <e> <s> like many others taking part today my noble friend has had a long interest in this subject and i was going to say to him if he had been present that this was his best speech out of the six he has made on the subject in the last years <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on

there of british leyland <e> <s> is he also aware of the considerable emotional and practical support for this car and is he further aware that to many people it seems a defeatist twist by british

bill be now read a second time <e> <s> the title of this small bill may have a certain familiar ring to the house as in and an almost identical bill was twice piloted through the house with typical

scotland <e> <s> this bill if accepted by the house would bring england and wales into line with that legislation and would thus fill a gap in the present powers of protection of our native fish stock

lords i beg leave to ask the first question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> can he say whether the government are holding joint discussions with the operators to find ways of achieving economies <e> <s> i have particularly in mind the air traffic control especially over europe <e> <s> i wonder whether the government have evidence that air traffic problems cause wasteful fuel consumption and lead to higher prices for fares <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank my noble friend for that reply would he agree that these statistics are very important <e> <s> may i ask my noble friend what action the government plan to ensure that as much unused and derelict land as possible is developed for public use <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank my noble friend for that list of good things which the government are doing may i ask him whether he will review again whether the statistics of unused and derelict land could be updated annually or biennially or even triennially <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paperion <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank my noble friend for that reply in view of the size of the unemployment at the moment i hope my noble friend will review and perhaps even tighten the regulations on such permits and is he aware that when one wishes to find a typical english restaurant with typical english food it is becoming increasingly difficult <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that informative answer may i ask him to tell us what is the likely funding programme that the government might reinvest from the revenues of the north sea oil in this important alternative energy <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell me whether it is british airways which has to apply for the overflight agreements or whether in fact her majestys government negotiate <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> is he aware of the general concern felt by the industry as to the effective policing of our fisheries and as to whether it is tight enough <e> <s> is he aware that within the limits of the six-mile and the -mile area it is felt that the other industries within the community blatantly disregard some of the regulations and so diminish our fish stocks <e> <s> finally can he advise the house to what extent the fishery protection service now patrol the waters <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that answer may i ask whether he can say whether the government are satisfied that the present conservation measures within the eec are being observed by members and how we know that the total allowable catches are not being exceeded <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether the government are considering or would consider paying minimum grants to fish farmers in order that they may qualify for the eec grants <e>", "<cs> i have one probing point to put to my noble friend of which i am sorry not to have given him warning <e> <s> it is a very simple point <e> <s> clause gives an interpretation of the meaning of dwelling-house what is a dwelling-house what may be a dwelling-house what is a flat and then if one looks at subsection it reads <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i have another point on clause although not a very big point <e> <s> my noble friend will have seen that last friday there was a change in the highest court of appeal on the rights of ownership of homes where the wife who is not necessarily an owner a joint owner of the house now has a much greater right to the ownership <e> <s> it is a very important point <e> <s> in a way it transpires on this clause because what we have here is the right of the tenant or the joint tenant to serve a notice on the council <e> <s> the point i should like to raise is under clause <e> <s> the tenant has the right to serve the notice and he may elect three of his family also to benefit from this clause <e> <s> suppose he does not elect his wife <e> <s> in the clause it refers to his only or principal home and later on refers to his only or principal house <e> <s> i would have thought it should have said his or her principal home or house <e> <s> i should like some clarification <e> <s> if my noble friend cannot give that now perhaps he will let me know later regarding the automatic right of the wife <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i have given no notice to my noble friend on this point but i think it is important it concerns reimbursement for improvements done by tenants to their houses <e> <s> under subsection <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to support my noble friend very strongly <e> <s> i do not think this would be laying too great a hardship on the housing management of any local council <e> <s> i do not think any housing committee should be without this information anyway and the inhabitants of any area should feel that the committee has this information available <e> <s> i do not think it is too arduous a job <e> <s> i believe my noble friend is absolutely correct in saying there is severe hardship and i would welcome this duty being laid on councils <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies may i ask the noble baroness lady birk to explain precisely how the loophole she dealt with will in practice be stopped by the amendment <e> <s> she said that the onus as to whether or not it is a holiday letting will lie on the landlord and i presume the landlord will have to produce a form and invite the tenant or occupant of the holiday letting to sign that form <e> <s> surely it is a little tough on any landlord however proper he is or however genuine the cause other than for him to accept some undertaking from the tenant that it is actually a holiday letting <e> <s> i therefore wonder whether what the noble baroness is proposing would ever work in practice in other words whether the amendment would hold tight in a practical market <e>", "<cs> do i understand that the isles of scilly are included in the bill <e> <s> if they are included may i assume that the isle of wight and the isle of man are also included <e>", "<cs> with respect it is not in the local authority of hampshire <e> <s> the isle of wight is a separate body <e>", "<cs> can my noble friend let me know later about the isle of man <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord janner commands great respect in the committee but i think he is mixing up a service charge with which we are dealing here and the rent acts and the rights of landlords under those acts to charge a certain premium for the right to purchase individual flats <e>", "<cs> the way subsection is drafted it is extremely complicated <e> <s> it says that paragraphs to of schedule shall not apply and then says that sections to a shall apply <e> <s> could we try to simplify the clause for those who have to practise the law <e>", "<cs> what does the noble lord mean by speculators benefiting from a service charge <e>", "<cs> this is irrelevant <e>", "<cs> i know that the noble lord lord janner feels very strongly about the tenants position and rightly so <e> <s> he is a practising solicitor of great merit <e> <s> but he is missing the point <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could say briefly as my name was mentioned by the noble lord lord monson that i suspect the noble lord lord monson is possibly on his own now some decade later in taking the view that one could go any further with the leasehold reform act <e> <s> when the act came into effect i felt just as strongly about it because one was affecting a market and one was removing what were in a sense very large capital sums from freeholders who might have invested in property a year before and who a <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend and welcome this amendment <e> <s> i should like to make one plea on a general point schedule is possibly the most complicated gibberish one would almost say in the reform of the leasehold reform act <e> <s> it is so bad that i hope my noble friend will insist that an explanatory memorandum is published very soon so that everyone knows their rights tenants landlords and the professionals <e> <s> quite frankly at the moment you have to buy three old acts this new act and then you have to piece it all together <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to the house both for the length of the amendment and for the fact that it is a manuscript <e> <s> i would apologise to my noble friend except for the fact that i see he has already had three manuscript amendments so i feel that i am in good company <e> <s> i do not intend to speak for any length of time the purpose of the amendment is very <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i am satisfied with that reply for which i am grateful <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise for not adding my name to the official list of speakers <e> <s> i rise briefly to support my noble friends motion <e> <s> as one of the less experienced members of the fairly strong sub-committee and therefore perhaps more baffled than others with the thick spiders web of the complexity surrounding the european air fares structure one experienced and appreciated even more the skill knowledge and mastery of my noble friends chairmanship <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt my noble friend i think that he has misunderstood clause on consultations <e> <s> if a highway authority or the minister wished to impose a hump consultations would then have to take place <e> <s> consultations therefore have not taken place so far <e> <s> if for instance on the noble lords road outside his home a hump is to be placed down there will be procedures as laid down in clause which could involve a public inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl to be more specific <e> <s> at what speed would it be dangerous for either a motorist or motor cyclist to go over them <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend has read the report which i am sure he has he will have noticed that it is quite safe to take them at mph as is indicated in the report <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all noble lords and all my noble friends for making this second reading such a lively debate <e> <s> i do not object to the anti-humpers putting their case so forcefully but one was rather surprised on a second reading which normally considers the principle of a bill that so many detailed questions should have been fired at one <e> <s> i would say to my noble anti-humper friends that they have had a very good run <e> <s> i accept of course their sincerity and i hope that they will understand me when i say that they are off course and off target and if i may offer a word of advice to my noble friend lord howe i would suggest to him that the next time he finds himself driving over a hump he should not be driving an italian car but a british one <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that one could truthfully describe some of the noble lords who have so far taken part in this debate as godfathers of aviation <e> <s> the standard may now drop a little in experience but not in enthusiasm <e> <s> my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter described our civil aviation industry as the second largest of the free world <e> <s> i would venture to add that it comes first when one looks at the influence of aviation in the free world when one looks at the innovations the development of markets and the fact that we have been able to bring air travel to many people when one looks at the standards of service of our airlines and above all at the standard of our safety record <e> <s> it is a <e>", "<cs> could my noble friend perhaps go a little further and consider whether the minister could pass over the duty under the act but retain a reserve power if there were such a public outcry that the discretionary powers now being conferred on the caa were being misused or mishandled <e> <s> my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter has raised an important point which seems to have been somewhat fogged over in that apparently we are not to know the actual facts of it <e> <s> however it seems that if he is correct in saying that for the sake of two minutes the sword of damocles came down and no one was available with whom to discuss the matter that cannot be a satisfactory situation <e> <s> i assume it could occur again and i therefore support my noble friends amendment as indeed a later amendment of mine which is in similar terms <e>", "<cs> i should like to raise one issue under this important clause which the committee will remember requires the authority to publish from time to time statements of its policy <e> <s> one of those policies which i hope will be retained concerns the class licensing policy <e> <s> the class licence is a form of protection for british helicopter operators to provide services notably to the north sea in connection with oil installations <e> <s> it was devised under the chairmanship of my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> this form of protection was principally designed to avoid unfair foreign competition <e> <s> it is a policy which is adopted by governments throughout the world mostly on a much tighter basis <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend for that assurance <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend and with that assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has suffered a long innings today but quite frankly i am not satisfied at all <e> <s> i think that it is somewhat discourteous to say that the government are not aware that there is this problem of the outer circle

government department over the last nine or months <e> <s> it has had copious correspondence with them and a great number of meetings <e> <s> the president of the national farmers union has had personal letters from the minister <e> <s> for my noble friend to turn round and say that he is not aware of the problem i think shows a certain lack of appreciation and sensitivity to this issue <e> <s> quite frankly he has not answered the point <e>", "<cs> before i come to this decision may i ask my noble friend whether he agrees with me that there is a different basis of compensation under the laws of compensation which are very complicated between those who are in the acres and those who are in the acres <e>", "<cs> i would yield to no one in my admiration of my noble friends skill in this but i would assure my noble friend that there is a basic difference in the compensation provisions between these two cases <e> <s> it is a relevant matter and it concerns people <e> <s> i am most grateful that my noble friend will look at this again <e> <s> i hope we might even discuss this matter before the next stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble lord lord underhill for his general welcome to the bill and for his brevity in moving the first amendment in view of the fact that there are <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord lucas of chilworth asked me to comment <e> <s> as he said this is a probing amendment <e> <s> i am looking at the same brief as my noble friend lord avon and this is a very serious matter and frankly i think my noble friend speaking on behalf of the government has answered the question <e> <s> is there anything particular to which my noble friend lord lucas would like me to reply <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say that i do not feel depressed about the debate on the depressions but i do understand my noble friends hackles rising when faced with a time limit and when one is told that the bill will not go on to the statute book if there is an amendment <e> <s> i have had the honour of serving in this house for over years and my noble friend has served for many years but we all know that these occasions arise but i think there is a difference between a bill which is giving exact powers and an enabling bill such as this <e>", "<cs> if i may just reply to the noble viscount as i tried to explain depressions are already in legislation under section of the act so that this has just been plucked out of existing legislation and put into this bill <e> <s> what the minister has said is that until the highway authority has those <e>", "<cs> i have not got the reference to what i said at second reading and of course i accept what my noble friend says <e> <s> what i am quite sure of is that the local authorities the highway authorities the county councils and the glc have been consulted on this <e>", "<cs> may i add that although my noble friend said that he considered that the prime use of humps would be in urban areas i think that there is one other example namely possibly country parks where they could be used <e>", "<cs> i think that my noble friend has expressed no faith in the subsequent regulations <e> <s> indeed i think he expressed himself in that way on the previous amendment on which we divided and i am sorry that he feels like that <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill went vividly through all the protections which will subsequently flow after this small enabling bill hopefully goes on to the statute book <e> <s> my noble friend referred to the report indeed he even poured scorn on this experimental report <e> <s> but that is not the basis of the regulations <e> <s> the basis will be consultation with the police and with the different organisations which are concerned with roads and consultations on every safety factor of which one can think <e> <s> i think my noble friend is wrong if he does not believe that the regulations will be the bones of the safety precautions under the bill <e>", "<cs> it is not an act of faith it is an act of realism <e> <s> i do not know whether my noble friend was with us at the earlier stages but we are discussing a small enabling bill to give a framework for subsequent regulations to be brought forward and then to be approved by both houses of parliament <e> <s> it is the detail of the regulations that we shall of course discuss in great depth <e> <s> i sympathise with my noble friend about the pressure of time but as i said before he has been in this house for many years and he knows the problems of another place <e> <s> he knows that if we send bills back at this stage particularly a private members bill they stand absolutely no chance <e> <s> i hope that he will take into account that this is a road safety measure <e>", "<cs> i apologise they are negative resolutions <e> <s> but even so both houses of parliament would have an opportunity to debate the regulations and indeed could refuse the regulations <e> <s> of course they can be amended very simply <e>", "<cs> may i say to the noble lord lord hale that he need never apologise for taking part in a committee stage since his long experience and wisdom are always much appreciated <e> <s> with regard to the question that he raised if he looks at clause of the bill he will see that the regulations are subject to annulment procedure <e> <s> the noble lord will well remember that the statutory instruments act requires regulations to be laid before each house of parliament and any member of either house can put down a prayer <e> <s> i think that perhaps answers the point <e>", "<cs> i am happy to give my noble friend the assurance that all responsible bodies representing motor vehicle users will be consulted <e> <s> i presume that i can speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and because they cover the same point <e> <s> unless my noble friend on the front bench corrects me such bodies as i have mentioned will be consulted <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl lord howe for that intervention <e> <s> if i am wrong i will write to him before the next stage <e> <s> but i am sure that as a responsible body they will be among those consulted <e>", "<cs> it is indeed highly desirable and as the noble lord lord airedale may well recall from other previous bills of this nature this is just a standard form of words that is used <e> <s> i am able to give an assurance to the noble lord that it will be the normal practice in making regulations to spread the consultation net as widely as possible to include all representative organisations and bodies who might have an interest in them <e>", "<cs> i am happy to give my noble friend that assurance <e>", "<cs> the aa comes first alphabetically <e>", "<cs> while my noble friend is looking up the answer i think i am right in saying that when this bill passes and becomes an act as i hope it will clause will come into force <e> <s> what would then take its place is clause of the bill which will give special powers to the minister to carry on experimental work <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indeed grateful for my noble friends positive assurance <e> <s> i am sorry that he feels there is no need to put this into <e>", "<cs> my lords i was hoping that the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house is grateful to the noble lord lord airedale for raising this small amendment and once again attracting such am interesting debate on this small enabling bill <e> <s> i was going to congratulate the noble lord upon his ingenuity in resurrecting what we discussed in committee that was until my noble friend advised me that the amendment was defective <e> <s> nevertheless one recognises the concern felt by the noble lord and by my noble friend lord lucas of chilworth the noble earl lord howe and all other noble lords and the noble baroness who have spoken <e> <s> the concern was that what was intended to be a bill concerned with safety might in fact prove to be an unsafe bill <e> <s> those of us who went through the long committee stage of this small bill understood that it is an enabling bill and know that all the safety details regarding motorcyclists speed limits depressions and all the other points that have

addition to that be the cost of the signs and notices <e> <s> i hope that that gives an indication of the cost <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i need notice of that question <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord suggested that this amendment was considered on report and was withdrawn but did not satisfy the house at that time <e> <s> i think in fact it was in committee that the noble lord put down exactly the same amendment word for word and the noble lord then did accept the arguments and the assurances that were given extracted from my noble friend that all the proper bodies concerned under clause would be contacted and discussions would take place <e> <s> we had a very long debate on this issue <e> <s> so i am a little perplexed as to why the noble lord wishes to raise an exactly similar amendment having withdrawn the other one after accepting the assurances <e>", "<cs> my lords i think sometimes we have strayed a little far from the precise nature of the amendment <e> <s> if we could just concentrate our minds on the amendment it of course presents a very important issue <e> <s> i do not deny that at all <e> <s> it is a parliamentary procedural issue whether this bill should have a negative procedure or an affirmative procedure <e> <s> the house knows the weakness of the negative procedure in another place <e> <s> the house knows the opportunities that members in another place have of raising a debate on negative procedure <e> <s> i do not hide that <e> <s> but we in this house also know that every member has a right to lay a prayer <e> <s> i have been looking back over the last years to see how many times prayers have been laid and how successful they were <e> <s> the noble lord lord trefgarne is the current champion he has laid four prayers against orders

unsatisfactory in a statutory instrument <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be wrong of me to say yes there is but if i were to quote one example it would be the road traffic regulations which were in a sense much more important in the safety context than this small bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be a courtesy to thank all those members who have shown such a keen and burning interest in this small bill and to thank my noble friend lord avon on i think his first occasion of helping to assist a bill through this house he

larger firms do and thus benefit those who work for them <e> <s> finally is my noble friend alert to the fact that because any increase in the allowance for the one million users of luncheon vouchers would come within the existing allowance of benefits in kind the cost to the treasury would be very small <e>", "<cs> i should like to support most strongly my noble friend <e> <s> i believe that this is the most vital amendment that will be moved this afternoon because it strikes at the heart of the argument which went through all the stages in another place so ably led by mr ivan lawrence qc who got the better of the governments arguments on this issue <e> <s> in fact one sees today that the government have moved a little distance by suggesting an amendment later on the marshalled list which implies some measure of consultation <e>", "<cs> i welcome this chance to give my noble friend clarification because i think that i can answer both his questions with one answer <e> <s> basically one is talking about those areas where fluoride has been injected into the water supply where the devices will be fitted free <e> <s> the devices which are technically very clever will only take out what has been put in and would not take out or lower any natural fluoride already in the water <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i received quite the courtesy that i expected from the government but there it

withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> am i correct in thinking that i ought to discuss this aspect when we come to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i am a little confused <e> <s> is it the wish of my noble friend lady trumpington that i should withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> then perhaps i may wrap it up by saying how disappointing i found the reply from both my noble friend on the front bench and lord campbell of croy <e> <s> obviously i did not make my point clearly enough <e> <s> i am not talking about withdrawing regional health in scotland i am simply saying that scottish law should examine this matter to ensure that there is proper consultation for the scots which is not provided for in england <e> <s> i would hope that scottish law which is a proud law would wish to examine this very important issue by itself <e> <s> that was my point <e> <s> following the very disappointing reply that i have received i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend decides what he wishes to do can my noble friend the minister give a little more information on the costs of running a new fluoridation scheme with a water authority <e> <s> i am not asking about the additional manpower costs but it is the cost of the fluoride that concerns me most of which i believe comes from fisons <e> <s> the cost was not disclosed in another place although i think a figure of about tonnes a year was mentioned <e> <s> however as regards the users the ratepayers can my noble friend give an indication of the cost so that we can see the size of the bill that will face those who do not want fluoride in their water <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lord who moved the amendment and indeed the noble lord lord houghton <e> <s> both cases put forward were extremely compelling <e> <s> the most important matter about the bill is the lack of consultation democracy and personal choice <e> <s> it stands out so strongly that i think that it is offensive not to have this amendment in <e> <s> i hope that noble lords will feel strongly on this amendment even if we have covered similar ground before <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord cledwyn actually asked a very important question <e> <s> it was whether an elected body would take the decision <e> <s> i think that my noble friend replied that we shall come to that later <e> <s> i am not sure why we have to wait <e> <s> why cannot she answer that question now <e> <s> will an elected body take that decision and if necessary have enough influence to say no <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is always charming but she has not convinced me <e> <s> she says that there is no reason to advise the consumer <e> <s> there is a reason <e> <s> the water has been changed and that is the whole purpose of this notification <e> <s> if she does not accept that i cannot accept her advice to withdraw the amendment because there is a reason <e> <s> i am disappointed <e> <s> when she says there will be general public consultation that is perfectly true if our amendment is accepted but that is not notification <e> <s> the ordinary users will not be involved in the general public consultations at all <e> <s> there will be consultations with the public bodies with i hope the local councils and anyone materially affected but not the individuals <e> <s> i feel very strongly that this amendment should be looked at in a more sympathetic way <e>", "<cs> i do not feel that i can withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i think we have a choice of either testing the committee or simply negativing it <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for the intervention of the noble lord who obviously speaks with great knowledge of the way things work <e> <s> however i must admit that i am not convinced about the cost of collecting the information <e> <s> quite frankly everything is on computers nowadays and it can be swept into the central computer and spun out at the touch of one button <e> <s> therefore the cost argument is not really a convincing one <e> <s> what i am worried about is that there might be thought to be a cover-up situation because a situation could arise in which there was a blow-out of the pipes or a blow-through of the fluoride so that the level gets up to or mg when it should be only mg no one might ask about it on that day so it would be hidden and it could be a great temptation for any water authority which is not obliged to publish not to make it known because it might cause a lot of criticism and indeed hysteria among users <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the noble lords support and for the understanding which my noble friend has shown <e> <s> with the assurance that the matter will be looked at again and perhaps we can discuss it before the next stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful for the support i have received and for the undertaking of my noble friend to have a look at these two amendments <e> <s> i think that what has been expressed to the committee shows the amount of concern <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will take that on board <e> <s> has my noble friend given an undertaking to look at this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not sure what degree of undertaking that is <e>", "<cs> a little watery i rather agree <e> <s> i am happy to withdraw the amendment but on the understanding that i shall wish to look at this again <e>", "<cs> as i have a similar amendment which follows perhaps i may speak on this amendment and not move my own <e> <s> my noble friend will have seen that in another place there was a most illuminating discussion where the honourable member for burton put forward a sheaf of actual evidence from america and australia of the effects of corrosion by fluoridated water on water pipes

equivalent of dollars for each dwelling <e> <s> the report stated <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord lord energlyn has made a good point <e> <s> surely there is nothing wrong in putting into a bill what would be statute law <e> <s> you do not just have to rely on common law <e> <s> the government know the emotions and the emotive feelings arising from this bill and they should write in this amendment <e>", "<cs> my noble friend started off by giving me a crumb of comfort when he said that the government understands the feelings against the bill <e> <s> he went on to say something that we have heard more than a few times since the first days of the committee that there were overwhelming medical arguments in favour of this medication <e> <s> at that point i was depressed by his reply

have the power to add something in addition to wholesome water <e> <s> that is the argument <e> <s> i am concerned that the government are not prepared to make even a minor adjustment or to give an assurance <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just ask my noble friend about the words reasonable notice in subsection <e>", "<cs> i think that is a good answer but it does not actually answer the question <e> <s> is one week reasonable or two weeks or three weeks <e> <s> there must be a period of time considered to be a reasonable period <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies i wonder whether i may just say this <e> <s> i find it most important to get right the clause on consultation in this bill <e> <s> i support everything that the noble lord has just said <e> <s> i think he spoke very clearly <e> <s> i was encouraged by my noble friend that in withdrawing her amendment she used the words it may not go far enough <e> <s> that is most encouraging <e> <s> it certainly does not go far enough <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord saying that procedures that have been so well used under planning legislation should be adopted where this is sensible <e> <s> the procedures in planning provide for statutory duties of notice and all the matters that the noble lord has mentioned <e> <s> is that what he is suggesting <e>", "<cs> will my noble friend say from what article or report she was quoting <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has raised a serious issue <e> <s> what he had done for me anyway is confirmed something which is always at the back of ones mind but when one listens to my noble friend lady trumpington quoting from this new zealand report one almost thinks that we are all crackpots and unbalanced <e> <s> but when one hears evidence like that <e>", "<cs> perhaps evidence is too strong <e> <s> the noble lord has been given something and it is obviously at too short notice for him to verify everything which is deeply disturbing <e> <s> i think we had an amendment on the first day which said that for those who medically should not receive fluoridated water there should be an alternative supply or some compensation so that they could purchase water which did not have the content of fluoride in it <e>", "<cs> we shall not have a chance to speak on the next amendment proposed by the noble lord lord monson if we agree to this one <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend considers her reply she did explain in fairness to her when she moved this amendment that it was specifically to assist those health authorities which had existing schemes to legitimise but of course it does not cover scotland <e> <s> scotland has no schemes at all they will be all new schemes in scotland <e> <s> i would support the noble lord and i should like to ask my noble friend why are they plucking this out of the bill now in scotland when they are all new schemes <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord houghton made a good point as always <e> <s> the reason as i understand it why acts always are given a time lapse before they come into operation is to ensure that people have time to digest the provisions that their advisers have time to digest the act <e> <s> it is very unusual unless there is an emergency reason to bring in an act straight away <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is of course aware that unsecured loans represent only per cent <e> <s> of the total as set out in the green paper <e> <s> he is painting a black picture as if building societies will be irresponsible <e> <s> but he appreciates that it is only per cent <e> <s> which is a very small amount <e>", "<cs> i support the government on this issue and i should like to know following upon what my noble friend has said about staff being dispersed and how we are to get continuity on planning what the timescale is likely to be before this new development plan is brought forward <e> <s> i think that from the point of view of the planners who try to advise people the fact that one already has a structure plan approved is good to be getting on with <e> <s> there is no harm in the fact that the draft structure plan which the glc brought forward has not been adopted and i believe that the fact that there was

before the noble lord lord houghton replies may i point out that i believe he was speaking only to amendment no <e> <s> and not to amendment no <e> <s> which deals with publicity but i may be incorrect in saying that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord is moving only amendment no <e> <s> and not speaking to amendment no <e> <s> about publicity but i may be wrong <e> <s> my noble friend replied to amendment no <e> <s> as though the noble lord had moved it <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend confirm that the cohoe salmon was originally brought in for fish farming on an experimental basis but is now banned <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to my noble friend because i was not in the chamber when he moved these regulations <e> <s> however i was glad to hear that he moved them briefly and very distinctly and i would congratulate him on that <e> <s> i was going to agree with much of what the noble lord lord graham said until almost his very last sentence when i believe he said that the public were suffering as i understood it and i believe that his party is committed to abolishing the fees <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will correct me if i am wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to be corrected <e> <s> i thought that the noble lord was criticising the whole principle of charges and was therefore implying that his party might take a different view should they form a government <e> <s> i do not know how far my noble friends brief goes but i should like to ask a few questions because this is an opportunity to discuss an important side of planning and indeed the whole ambit of town and country planning <e> <s> i should like to ask my noble friend in regard to these regulations whether his department has received a large postbag of complaints on the level of charges <e> <s> also has there been any case made out that the charges are set too high <e> <s> i have never met that myself quite frankly and i welcome the realism of these regulations in the reductions they make because clearly they have arisen from the experience of having introduced the charges and that is obviously very helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that informative and revealing reply <e> <s> however would he agree that the electorate of the isle of wight and i must declare an interest has a fairly poor deal <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that the island has special problems with an annual growth rate of per cent <e> <s> an overworked member of parliament and an under-represented electorate and that it deserves to have two members of parliament <e> <s> would the noble lord further agree that the matter should not be left to the parliamentary boundary commission to consider in say years time but should be reviewed now <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the member of parliament for the isle of wight is an outstanding member of parliament even though he comes from the liberal party <e> <s> what my question was seeking to bring out which i say in deference to the noble lord lord tordoff is a serious matter is that one member of parliament is representing in this case people and in another case only people <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that helpful reply and being the first to congratulate him on his maiden reply from the dispatch box may i ask him whether he has figures on the waiting times including the peak periods and whether the review that is being undertaken includes consultations with both airlines and the british airports authority <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell us anything further about the choice of engine in this project and also about the likely number of jobs involved for british aerospace in the british input in this european project <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank my noble friend for that reply would he agree that many telephones are used while drivers are in motion <e> <s> does he agree that if a driver is travelling at miles an hour during the rush hour on a dark evening on the m and makes a contentious call to his wife to say that he may be late that is quite outside the scope of the <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend have any record of accidents which occurred while the telephone was being used <e>", "<cs> my lords reverting to the original answer of my noble friend with regard to the important word shortly does it mean within or after that period <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that reassuring answer and also for the information about the british airways s which are subject to these tests can he tell us whether through the faa the international co-ordinating body i understand for all boeings flying throughout the world the test programme of other airlines flying into britain is progressing as satisfactory as that of british airways <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend also say whether other wide-bodied aircraft as well as s are being considered for similar tests <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> i recall that westminster city council have so far spent over on simply making the structure of the building safe <e> <s> in view of the very unusual circumstances surrounding the situation are her majestys government considering any plans to indemnify westminster city council against the costs which they have already incurred until there is proper satisfaction between themselves and the iranian government <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that very full reply which i shall examine with great care <e> <s> can he confirm that one of the factors contributing to this oversupply was the sudden policy of milk quotas last year which forced a lot of dairy cows on to the beef market <e> <s> can he also say how long good quality beef remains in good condition in cold storage before it starts to deteriorate <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend reply to my first supplementary question about the length of time beef can remain in cold storage before deteriorating <e> <s> can he confirm the national farmers union figure of about months <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i anticipated that answer <e> <s> perhaps i may ask my noble friend whether when one is talking of a london airports policy it is really justifiable that the rail fare to heathrow the underground rail fare should be one-third of that from victoria to gatwick <e> <s> can he tell the house what percentage of rail passengers currently use the gatwick service which i say straightaway is very efficient <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is giving us a very interesting briefing <e> <s> when he says that aircraft were lost in the last years is he talking of the zone in which they were lost or their loss through misadventure <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to add my warm congratulations to my noble friend on his elevation to his new post and may i at the same time ask a very simple question <e> <s> the question is what will be the future of the men concerned in this matter <e>", "<cs> in the free world and one of the biggest contributors to our balance of payments <e> <s> i would add to that by saying that i think we are lucky with the general framework of civil aviation <e> <s> i think the civil aviation authority does an extremely good job and my noble friend distinguished himself as the first chairman of that body <e> <s> i recall that he introduced the first flight of the sky train service <e>", "<cs> i was hoping that my noble friend would intervene <e> <s> i presume that he possibly agrees with the principle of the amendment but does not wish to discourage the government from the course they are currently adopting <e> <s> i noticed earlier that my noble friend was quite stringent in the decision of the secretary of state over the helicopters <e> <s> i share his view on that <e> <s> i am sorry that i cannot get him to spring to his feet to give a view which i think the committee would appreciate <e>", "<cs> in that case perhaps we should have an intervention fee <e> <s> we are discussing a serious principle of the bill and i am surprised that noble lords opposite have not come in on this <e> <s> the principle that i put forward to the committee and which my noble friend put forward much more forcibly and with a much better prepared argument <e>", "<cs> i therefore now have one supporter in the committee <e>", "<cs> on behalf of my noble friend lord kings norton i should like to move his amendment no <e> <s> and speak also to my amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the committee is getting a little thin at this early hour but i am sure that enthusiasm has not waned at all and that we will have a very good discussion on the point that i wish to raise <e>", "<cs> i should first like to thank all members of the committee who have spoken on this amendment and indeed all those who spoke in favour of it in principle and one is talking about principle and not about the wording of the amendment <e> <s> i started by being hopeful at my noble friends reply when he talked about having sympathy but as he went on i felt that he was less and less sympathetic until eventually he seemed to take the view that he had knocked the arguments on the head <e> <s> to be quite honest i do not <e>", "<cs> with that kind assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for his reply and for the qualified support that i have received <e> <s> if it was a question of seeing the amendment agreed to i would of course accept optimum instead of maximum <e> <s> that improves the amendment <e> <s> my noble friend is i think saying that the principle of the amendment is covered in the bill <e> <s> i wonder whether i am right in saying that <e>", "<cs> i am right in saying that <e> <s> i should like to examine the matter in more detail between now and the next stage of the bill and perhaps if necessary have a word with my noble friend <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord underhill referred to amendment no <e> <s> which refers to environmental consequences <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not comment <e> <s> i beg your pardon <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down i am not sure whether i am allowed to speak a second time on report stage he has raised an important point and i should like to ask him exactly what are the powers the minister could take in the future <e> <s> my noble friend has said that he will write to another of my noble friends <e> <s> however this is really the kernel of the amendments and i find it unacceptable that although my noble friend has come prepared with an answer he cannot answer the kernel and the purpose of the amendment <e> <s> may i suggest to my noble friend that as we continue our discussion perhaps further advice could come from the box behind so that he will be able to answer this question <e> <s> if he cannot answer it i would say with respect to him that he has not given us a totally satisfactory reply <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case can my noble friend given an assurance that we can bring this point back again at third reading without being in breach of our rules of procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations to my noble friend and to express gratitude for the manner in which both my noble friend his honourable friend and indeed his department have brought forward a very comprehensive amendment to try to meet the arguments that have been advanced during the passage of the bill <e> <s> i believe that much of this amendment meets the anxieties that have been expressed by the airlines on this question of capacity and i wish this new clause well in the hope because undoubtedly the problems of capacity will remain with us and rear their heads in the future that this new clause will add something in the way of assistance to civil air transport <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend has not withdrawn the amendment i should like to support the principle behind it and to say that the actual case that it arose out of was a letter from a mr kala who had been a licensee since of the central lancashire new town development corporation <e> <s> he saw very wisely that his case would have been excluded from the provisions of compensation and so he wrote not as one would have thought to the nfu or to the cla because he knew there were still squabbles among them and not to the government because he knew that they were still battling over the main framework of the quotas he wrote to the professional bodies with whom he had dealt and in whom he had confidence <e> <s> i think that they should take credit for drawing the attention of the government to this amendment <e> <s> i should also like to thank my noble friend lord belstead for accepting the principle and bringing in very swiftly his own amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be the first to admit that there are a few holes in this amendment <e> <s> first of all i think that it is in the wrong section but to use the word suspicion is slightly strong because really all this humble amendment tries to achieve is to ascertain the basis of valuation <e> <s> when looking at a farm you do not just look at the land you also look at the buildings <e>", "<cs> my lords i support my noble friend <e> <s> i think that it is an unfair basis for the calculation <e> <s> i do not know how many members of the house understand the equation <e> <s> as i understand it we put the numerator on the top line and the numerator plus the denominator equals the fraction <e> <s> as my noble friend said there are two calculations at different times <e> <s> that can throw up an injustice either to the tenant or to the landlord <e> <s> if the tenant is currently paying too high a rent which is possible with the rents coming down he will suffer <e> <s> if the landlord is receiving too low a rent he will suffer <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that helpful and encouraging reply may i ask whether he will say how the negotiations with japan are progressing <e> <s> what is the likely timetable for the london direct flight to tokyo to come into force <e> <s> finally how many hours will be saved on the present route via anchorage <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that somewhat cautious reply <e> <s> can she say whether the government appreciate that to limit the supply of disposable syringes only to diabetic patients would be a tremendous help not only to those patients as regards their safety and comfort but also to hospitals and doctors through the saving in time taken up by filling out forms <e> <s> can my noble friend advise the house what the cost would be if that were allowed on the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that helpful and informative reply but is he aware that whereas years ago a speculative cheap office building in a central shopping street close to the houses of parliament may perhaps have been suitable for the headquarters of the metropolitan police today that building with its long history of bits and pieces falling off its leaking roof its wholly inadequate car parking facilities for police vehicles and a major problem of security because of its long street frontage is not adequate at all <e> <s> will the government consider whether the glc building could provide a home for the new facilities of the police headquarters <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether the present headquarters is in time likely to be outgrown so far as concerns the number of staff required there and that therefore a move may be necessary anyway <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to intervene and to apologise for my lack of courtesy in not putting my name down to speak <e> <s> although we have heard some stringent comments about the lack of time in which to examine the bill i should like to add that this is a good bill <e> <s> it is a bill which will help many tenants <e> <s> it is perhaps long overdue and it has as i understand it received all-party consent through the usual channels to go forward <e> <s> it has not been a government steamrolling measure <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support my noble friend not only by saying that the programme is an important one but also by saying that it is a very good programme for not merely the british aerospace industry but all the many support companies <e> <s> what does the project mean for the many sub-contractors who will obtain the benefits of being able to join in the scheme <e> <s> it is very easy when one looks back at concorde and all the other projects that have taken place to take a negative view <e> <s> this project is long term <e>", "<cs> my lords when i first saw the brief from the country landowners association i too felt strongly that there was an injustice <e> <s> having looked at the terms of compensation under compulsory purchase i take the side of the government <e> <s> my reason is that i am not sure there is an injustice <e> <s> so far no speaker has mentioned how one approaches compensation under compulsory purchase <e> <s> there is a procedure under the section certificate which my noble friend mentioned during the committee stage in which a quasi planning consent exists and it is upon that that a district valuer and the valuer for the landowner will reach some terms for compensation <e> <s> i believe that compensation will cover what will happen on planning consent <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for advising us of the advances being made <e> <s> can he tell us how wide the consultations have been and what research has been undertaken <e> <s> will his department take into account the severe imbalance between coinage and paper in our currency <e> <s> will he take into account the scottish attitude to the preservation of the note and perhaps if necessary introduce a note <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend moves from that point i am sorry if he felt that there was a misunderstanding <e> <s> the point i wanted to make and which i hope he can comment on is that any structure which in the future could limit the natural development of an airport is very important in planning terms and i hope that it will he considered <e> <s> i hope he can say that this point will be looked at very carefully when full consideration is given to the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may remind my noble friend that the forth bridge is called the forth bridge with some pride and it is part of the m as well <e> <s> from what my noble friend said the government have not decided on a name if any <e> <s> it sounds as though there will never be a name <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> i recognise the support that the government have given to british aerospace in this vital european airbus project <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that germany is reported to have given million directly to equipment companies <e> <s> does he agree that it is very important that we support the equipment companies to make certain that their technology and skilled staff do not lose out <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for the discourtesy in not putting my name down for this debate <e> <s> as my noble friend the whip in front of me has told me it is very discourteous <e> <s> but i am not sure whether it is more discourteous to put ones name down and not turn up than to turn up not having put ones name down <e> <s> perhaps the best courtesy is to speak for a short time and that is what i intend to do <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord can remind us what percentage of members will have to vote in favour of such an arrangement <e>", "<cs> we should like to move amendment no <e> <s> separately <e>", "<cs> not by me <e>", "<cs> the debate has been valuable and a number of points have been aired <e> <s> it was a probing amendment and i think that we should probe on <e> <s> with the ministers good will perhaps we shall have a chance to consider the question again at the next stage to see whether we can turn up some acceptable proposal <e> <s> as we said it is a difficult area and one does not necessarily come up with the right answer <e> <s> it is an important issue in the bill <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> there seems to be a lack of support in the committee for this amendment <e> <s> however i am grateful for the assurance that my noble friend has given <e> <s> i should like to ask him to confirm that the clerks of county schools and the clerks of voluntary aided schools will be paid out of the same county council budgets <e> <s> can my noble friend confirm that point <e>", "<cs> that i assume is out of the same budget <e> <s> there was a point put to me previously that it would be a different budget <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the assurance of my noble friend and for his reply <e> <s> i shall read it carefully <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the house for not putting my name down to speak in the debate but i was not sure whether i could be here in time <e> <s> i must declare an interest because i am the owner of two rather large donkeys <e> <s> i must say that i think it is most encouraging in this country that there is a very high esteem for donkeys <e> <s> this has been evidenced by the wide support for the donkey sanctuary charity which does great work by helping maltreated donkeys or donkeys which have been starved and generally ill-treated <e> <s> i noted that the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby pointed out that the definition of donkeys according to the act is asses <e> <s> therefore i assume that the title of the bill will need to be changed <e> <s> however perhaps he will comment on that point later on <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i did not hear the remark made by the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not being patronising <e> <s> in defending the government i was trying to reply to what i believed was not a particularly attractive attack <e> <s> during the committee stage the issue was raised as to whether the school governors with the considerably increased duties placed upon them under this bill should not only be entitled to special leave from their employment as they are already under the employment protection act but should also not be penalised for loss of salary in doing so <e> <s> at that time it was a probing amendment and there was support from all sides of the committee for the principle <e> <s> the fear was expressed that potentially good governors could be lost or denied to the education system because they could not afford to lose their pay <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to those noble lords who have taken part in the debate <e> <s> in reply to the noble lord lord morton of shuna i would say that the intention of the amendment is that the employer pays <e> <s> indeed under contracts of employment both in the trade unions and the civil service this is already obligatory <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend for a helpful and sympathetic reply <e> <s> i was interested to hear that the government are considering funding a study which i think will be helpful <e> <s> it is a delicate issue <e> <s> i do not wish to press the amendment but i am glad that i raised the matter <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to those who have supported the amendment and to my noble friend for her assurance which i am happy to accept <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend the minister for that reply particularly as we are coming up to the busiest weekend of the year <e> <s> does my noble friend agree that consumers are entitled to expect an efficient service for charter flights as well as scheduled flights <e> <s> will he confirm that when gatwick becomes overloaded with air traffic problems stansted as well as heathrow will be considered as an alternative airport <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply but does his department consider that pneumatic drills are quieter since the regulations were introduced <e> <s> are new drills tested to conform with the decibels allowed and is there any record of health damage to those who operate the machines <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the minister whether under company law there is a definition of a small shareholder <e> <s> the noble lord lord williams cited the case of the abbey national <e> <s> under the rules of that society a member must hold either or in order to vote <e> <s> i do not know whether when the society is converted to a company the same rule will apply or whether the member with an investment of will be able to vote <e>", "<cs> does the committee agree that the real principle is about democracy or overdemocracy <e> <s> i believe that the amendment seeks overdemocracy <e> <s> it is the right of every shareholder to attend a meeting raise issues and table a resolution on which he can vote <e> <s> shareholders have a perfect right to do so and we are not interfering with that principle <e> <s> what my noble friend is seeking is that the rights of companies and those in charge of them should be a litte more flexible <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all noble lords who have spoken and given us the benefit of their experience and wisdom in making this short debate the more valuable <e> <s> the noble lord lord tordoff chided me gently for the apparently small numbers taking part <e> <s> i must say to him that i much prefer quality to quantity and on this occasion we have achieved it <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the intervention made by my noble and learned friend lord hailsham happened to be on a very special birthday <e>", "<cs> this is a sensitive subject for all who have taken an interest in it over many years <e> <s> it is unfortunate that it should arise at this time of night <e> <s> i came with an open mind this evening <e> <s> i recall that in the government took a different view <e> <s> now they take another <e> <s> i agree wholeheartedly with the noble lord lord evans <e> <s> this is a

i am sure that they thought so too <e>", "<cs> i support the principle of the amendment but i also feel as does my noble friend that there is a minefield of problems <e> <s> there are two problems which i put to my noble friend who so eloquently moved the amendment <e>", "<cs> these amendments are connected with fire escape notices and the fact that the noble lord would like to see mandatory obligations put upon local authorities <e> <s> what is the evidence that there has been irresponsibility by local authorities on this important issue <e> <s> it is very disturbing if the noble lord has evidence <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord replies will my noble friend tell me whether there has been much requirement to use what he called draconian powers or has the effect of a reserve power been sufficient <e>", "<cs> perhaps my noble friend can tell me whether this is something that is not already done by local authorities or whether it is widely carried out and only some local authorities do not do it <e> <s> it is valuable information for the tenants <e>", "<cs> the noble lord made a very important point <e> <s> i hope that members of the committee will not feel in any way rushed when dealing with the matter because of the time of night <e> <s> we must give this proper consideration <e> <s> first the amendment as i understand it although i have not followed all the arguments indicates that through the governments policies those who have bought properties from local government have suffered <e> <s> however i should have assumed that such people <e>", "<cs> if the opposition are not welcoming this amendment i should like to ask my noble friend whether there will be a limit on the charge that the local authority may make under the regulations that will be issued <e> <s> i think that would be of interest because obviously those local authorities which do not wish to provide any services can quote a ridiculous charge <e> <s> at the moment there does not appear to me to be any indication of a reasonable charge being made <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord replies i wish to ask my noble friend whether there is at present or has been in recent times a lady on the <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for repeating the details of the written parliamentary answer last week and i pay tribute to the government for responding positively to this awful human tragedy and giving further financial support to individuals and their families <e> <s> but for reasons of clarity may i ask whether the government are satisfied that the trustees of the macfarlane trust are legally capable under the terms of the trust of distributing across-the-board payments <e> <s> if there is any doubt can this be settled by granting them an indemnity <e> <s> secondly are the government aware that the mathematical formula of the registered sufferers and the sum promised in the statement of per case exceeds the million <e> <s> is the per individual a positive commitment <e> <s> thirdly <e>", "<cs> very well i shall come back to that later <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> can he say whether under the new powers a european parliamentary committee can summon an individual member of the commission to attend to explain some action as it could previously <e> <s> secondly can he advise whether the system of scrutiny at westminster is being re-examined <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether one is allowed to interfere in what is a <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend as i am sure he is grateful to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter for his powerful defence of the civil aviation authority <e> <s> the discussion which we have had this afternoon is no criticism of that authority and the noble lord lord underhill went out of his way to state that <e> <s> it is a question of accountability <e> <s> i add that i am delighted that my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter was able to intervene because he was the distinguished first chairman of the civil aviation authority and brought great lustre to that position when the authority was set up <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend say whether the same protection is applied to draft green belt plans as to designated green belt plans <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> can he say following the debate last july initiated by the noble baroness lady robson on the report on fraud in the community vhether the task force promised by the commission has now been set up <e> <s> further has there been any reaction by the commission to the excellent recommendations set out in that report <e>", "<cs> my lords is the subject of improved scrutiny of the commissions work likely to be on the agenda of the
