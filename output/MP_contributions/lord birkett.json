this short debate <e> <s> indeed as it progressed i began to feel a little ashamed that i had not provided a rather larger bill for your lordships but that might have given further excuse for raising

has given us and while congratulating the noble lord lord strauss on his admirable maiden speech i must confess that this afternoons debate has rather surprised me <e> <s> i read the report carefully thought that it was exhaustive unusually well-written and on the whole an exceedingly helpful canter over a course which we have cantered over very often before <e> <s> therefore as i thought that i rather approved of it i wondered to myself whether i was not being rather reactionary in doing so <e> <s> imagine my surprise therefore at this time of the night on discovering that what i had thought might be a rather reactionary document has been widely regarded this afternoon as licentious <e>", "<cs> in supporting this amendment i should say that i do so only because i think that the bill will be better with it than without it <e> <s> since i have not spoken on this matter before i should declare not an interest but a widespread concern <e> <s> the department of recreation and arts of the greater london council of which i am the director controls a very large number of trees <e> <s> it controls all the parks within the greater london councils control in london and a good deal of open space besides including a large amount of green belt area which is now farmland <e>", "<cs> i too support the amendment again rather grudgingly <e> <s> i wish that it had not said over one acre <e>

viscount lord chandos on such a confident civilised and above all enormously knowledgeable maiden speech <e> <s> how appropriate also that it should be on the arts that he spoke considering the enormous gifts to the arts the dedication to them that lie within his family a family whose name i am happy to say is embodied in what is now one of the most famous and distinguished theatres in

hope to hear him often in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that if i added my one cheer to the one cheer uttered by the noble lord lord lloyd of hampstead it might by the end of the afternoon add up to a modest welcome for the bill <e> <s> i am reminded of <e>", "<cs> my lords i too must apologise for being unable to hear the start of this debate and for being unable to stay to the end of it <e> <s> i hope that i shall be forgiven more readily because what i have to say this afternoon is so exceedingly short <e> <s> however before i put in my pennyworth i must take a moment of your lordships time to take issue with the noble lord lord annan over one comment that he made <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i cannot give the bill in its new form any warmer welcome than i gave it last time <e> <s> i am well aware of the deep concern for the landscape of this country which motivates the noble lord lord somers in introducing the bill and i cannot believe that there is one of your lordships here today who does not share his concern <e> <s> yet i cannot believe that the bill will do the cause any good <e> <s> i should explain that i work for a local authority the greater london council <e> <s> indeed i am the councils director of recreation and arts and therefore i have within my sphere of influence what used to be the old parks department <e> <s> so i have a great deal to

appreciate the point that the noble lord is making and that is quite true of course but there are plenty of circumstances in which the only planting area one is talking about is the same planting area <e> <s> obviously one could go and plant two more trees quite elsewhere if that were the case but it still seems to me an illogical provision <e> <s> therefore i must say that i believe the bill is unnecessary in general and in detail is restrictive and i cannot honestly hope that it will receive a second reading <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount has been so enormously persuasive and so very clear that i find it rather difficult to oppose him as strongly as i actually do <e> <s> not only was he very clear about the purpose of the bill which i am sure is absolutely shared by every member of your lordships house he was exceedingly clear about the purpose behind his own amendments <e> <s> and he was even clearer about the purpose behind the amendment put down by the noble lord lord jenkins of putney and myself <e> <s> he has put the matter so very clearly that it only remains for me to dispute with him the confidence he has in the effect of his own amendment and the doubts he has about the effect of ours <e>", "<cs> my lords at the report stage last thursday as i understood it there never was disagreement about the intention of the bill or what it was to do <e> <s> the argument was about loopholes <e> <s> i believe that these amendments very successfully have brought all parties together and i rise only to echo the noble viscounts tribute to those officers who worked so untiringly to get it together to say that i support all his amendments because i believe the cinema industry in particular and the public in general will have cause to be grateful for them and also to congratulate him and to say that we are immensely obliged to him <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i rise very briefly to support the noble viscount in his motion <e> <s> your lordships will recall that in the debate last summer to which the noble viscount referred a great deal of attention was paid by many of your lordships in all parts of the house to the question of fish that might slip through the various nets which were being invented at the time <e> <s> i fear that there is a particular fish which will slip through this one if we are not careful <e> <s> the noble viscount has already referred to it <e> <s> it is quite a simple matter <e> <s> it is the matter of public houses <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness has said this is not a party political matter and therefore it is very satisfactory that the deep concern which is felt about the theatre museum should have come already within the first three speeches from three different quarters of the house <e>

no concern at all personally with the theatre museum <e> <s> hitherto it has been only a matter of a property deal that is to say it is dealt with by the valuer on behalf of the planning committee and the covent garden panel which serves it <e> <s> nevertheless being in the glc i cannot be ignorant of what has been going on and therefore perhaps i might be allowed to say that i think the deal which was arranged and which so nearly went through was indeed a very sensible and a very favourable one <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to echo the disquiet that many speakers today have expressed about what will happen to the arts in the event of the abolition of the glc and of the metropolitan councils <e> <s> i must needs declare an interest because i work for the glc <e> <s> i am its director of recreation and arts but i hope your lordships will believe that my personal employment prospects are of no importance whatever besides the crisis for the arts which i foresee looming for london <e>

close to the front line where i am standing <e> <s> however a declaration <e>", "<cs> my lords in the course of the recent traumatic debate on the local government paving bill i was happy to be able to pay a tribute to the noble earl the minister for the imaginative and responsive way he had coped with the difference between the original propositions put forward in the report on streamlining the cities in terms of what would happen in the event of abolition particularly in my case of the glc and what he had recently proposed <e> <s> i was so glad about that because what seemed to me to be wrong with the original proposal was that it relied to far too great an extent upon the good will and the ability of boroughs to cope with funding for the arts in london <e> <s> not only would they be facing rate capping <e> <s> of course and they might be even less able than some of them now are but the pattern of borough funding of the arts in london is basically so unpredictable and so unstable that it varies from below pence per head of population to over per head which is an enormous variation <e> <s> i thought that that could not be relied upon and i was therefore enormously relieved to find the ministers latest schemes which seem to take that worry away from me <e>", "<cs> since i see that i am invited from the government benches to speak i shall keep what i have to say as short as it is conceivable to do <e> <s> i have a practical point to make <e> <s> it has been suggested that interim administrations will be no more than caretaker administrations <e> <s> i refer not to the great debate on whether there should or should not be elections but only to caretaker administrations <e> <s> i say simply that from my experience of london it will not be the case that they will be merely caretaker administrations paving the way for abolition whether it comes or it does not <e> <s> they will have an incredible amount of work to do ongoing from decades before <e> <s> please be under no illusion that any administration will simply be a paving administration <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that even at this late hour your lordships will allow me a moment or two <e> <s> alas i must needs declare an interest <e> <s> the last time i spoke on such an occasion with equal reluctance on the part of the house i was so keen to cut everything out that i actually forgot to declare my

"<cs> my lords so much has been said tonight and so many good arguments put forward and so much of it has been said in unison that i shall try not to keep your lordships long <e> <s> i cannot let the debate go by without remarking on what a really desolate prospect this bill raises <e> <s> i am irresistibly reminded of somebody who piece by piece has taken apart a delicate and complex mechanism and who finds himself without the skill or energy to put it back together again <e> <s> from this bill the film industry seems to me really to be in pieces <e>", "<cs> my lords for the noble earl the minister this afternoons debate must have represented something of an argumentative sauna bath <e> <s> he is plunged from the warmest air of compliments and thanks into the iciest waters of criticism <e> <s> the only reason i do not wish to spoil that process is that i realise that sauna baths are reckoned to be wonderfully good for colds and it is plain that the minister is suffering badly from one and we are all sorry for it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl the minister and to the noble lord lord mcintosh for those interventions <e> <s> i think it would be much safer if i left the subject of films forthwith otherwise we shall be here all night <e> <s> however i must say that it is very warming to see in the proposals of the noble earl that of the million allocated to the arts for there is a special million for the british film institute <e> <s> i hope that nothing i said just now will be construed as anything except full admiration for the work done by the british film institute <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> lord jenkins <e> <s> he has cued me as it were to a point i was about to make <e> <s> having said how much i welcomed this one-for-one funding i was about to add that the danger of sponsorship is as the noble lord <e> <s> lord jenkins said partly the difficulty of discovering whether it is actually on top of or in addition to public funding and not instead of <e> <s> i sense that there is a nervousness within the nation that the noble earl the minister is looking to the private sector not merely to add to the funds but to replace them <e>", "<cs> my lords i stand corrected that is absolutely right <e> <s> the sources do include of course local government <e> <s> there will not be unless things go <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be pleased if the noble earl dealt with it now <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i am obliged to the noble earl for intervening at this stage <e> <s> i think that enough has been said for me to leave this point now but perhaps in leaving it i should just say that although i am bound to agree with him that million spread across the entire country looking towards local

year from now <e> <s> but i wish that i could share his confidence <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support most warmly the amendment put down by the noble baroness lady birk because unlike the noble

that not only to declare an interest as i must properly do but also because i hope to persuade your lordships that from my point of view from a desk at the very bureau of bureaucracy i see the stuff of the amendment of the noble baroness coming up every day <e> <s> i should say that strategic needs and strategic thoughts are my daily grind and my daily task <e>", "<cs> i shall not detain your lordships more than a moment but i cannot resist adding my voice to these small comments from my privileged position of being director of recreation and parks at the glc where i have responsibility for so much of londons open space <e>", "<cs> i am most interested in and even embarrassed at what the noble lord has to say <e>", "<cs> if there were a target for the speech of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter and i am sure that he intended no such thing it is i i am exactly that bureaucratic official to whom he referred who must needs produce reports for committees of members of whatever body it be <e> <s> this is by way of declaring my interest which <e> <s> i have been rightly obliged to do before your lordships on many occasions recently and never more acutely than today <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to the noble earl and taking his first point first of course i entirely accept that there is no obligation upon any government to foresee an endless growth in public funding <e> <s> i was speaking of the expectations of those already encouraged in their growth at the moment when the plateau first starts to exist <e> <s> i was not for a moment suggesting that the growth principle must simply because it is inherent in the arts be accorded space and validity by any government <e> <s> but those which have already been encouraged to grow will be bitterly disappointed faced with this landscape full of plateaux <e>", "<cs> your lordships will be aghast at the thought of hearing me speak again this evening as i fear that i spoke too long this afternoon <e> <s> however i cannot resist adding a moment or two on this subject to say a little of what i forgot to say earlier on the subject of parks and the need for a strategic authority <e> <s> i shall not weary your lordships again with the tales of burgess park and mile end and so on but i want to say for example that we have hounslow heath in london about which i confess we have done nothing so far <e> <s> there is the whole question of education within the parks which should be a centralised education service using the greenhouses and glasshouses that we have <e> <s> a nursery is provided and i referred earlier to an arboretum in newham something which i believe only a central authority can deal with <e> <s> there are so many good reasons for a central authority that i shall simply allow your lordships to think that i can continue the list all night but make you feel relieved by not doing so <e>", "<cs> it might be worth taking just a moment to add the arts dimension to this debate <e> <s> we have debated the arts so often that it would be foolish to go on at length about them but over the last four years what the glc has done for ethnic minority arts is something that is universally admired at any rate i hope so <e> <s> certainly it has put an enormous amount of heart into a great number of ethnic minority artists and that represents a range of arts that covers all the performance arts and most of the fine arts and crafts as well <e> <s> it has put heart into those artists and apart from that and this is often forgotten it has given london an enormously exciting range of arts from a very exciting and talented bunch of people <e>", "<cs> i am exceedingly grateful to the noble lord lord rochester for taking those two at once because i was quite in two minds as to which to speak to <e> <s> i should like to speak to them for a short time however because i control a department of the glc which actually employs people and they are very worried indeed in some cases deeply dismayed <e>", "<cs> my lords this is one of those occasions on which i must not only declare my interest but declare it very particularly especially in view of what the noble lord has just said <e> <s> i feel slightly hurt because the amendment has been described as covering various altogether too disparate territories <e> <s> this territory is exactly my concern every day of the week <e> <s> it is precisely my territory <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that your lordships will forgive me for one second if i speak about the south bank and take up a point which the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter made <e> <s> he accused the glc of being rather profligate and expensive in its running of it and he mentioned the director <e> <s> profligacy is a matter of opinion but there must be confusion here because unless he is referring to me and i suspect that he is not it is of course part of my empire like everything else <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg the noble lords pardon <e> <s> i missed the reference to the national theatre <e> <s> i thought the noble lord was talking about the concert hall and i was going to point out that it is only a matter of weeks ago that we even appointed a general manager there <e> <s> i stand corrected <e> <s> i am most interested to hear what the noble earl has to say about this amendment because i think that the phrase i told you so is the most attractive ever invented <e> <s> therefore i shall now be tempted to bring it out <e>", "<cs> my lords i imagine that your lordships will have anticipated at this moment a very short speech from one of the old regime <e> <s> i too must apologise to the noble lord lord graham for not being in my place when he moved his amendment <e> <s> i can only plead that traffic builds up in certain areas of london <e> <s> lest anyone should think that there is actually a political connotation to that traffic i plead ignorance of everything except arts and recreation this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will give way perhaps i ought to explain that the events that i was referring to which included the london marathon are all with the exception of the marathon entirely organised and sponsored if that is the right phrase by the glc <e> <s> we have for the most part invented them <e> <s> certainly we have run them and they are exclusively the province the expense and the organisation of the glc <e> <s> the marathon is of course the exception and i readily acknowledge that the glc is not the only organiser <e> <s> it is however the provider of the finish the provider of the start the provider of the organisation for the registration of runners which is <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that as the boards of both the national theatre and the royal shakespeare company have upon them eminent lawyers accountants and hard-headed businessmen of all sorts they are therefore highly capable of making a commercial deal in a commercial world when required and that the suggestion put about recently in the press that sir peter hall and mr trevor nunn have somehow pursued their own distinguished careers at the expense of the theatres they direct is patently absurd <e>", "<cs> my lords although i congratulate the noble lord lord donoughue on introducing this debate i must say that i agree with many noble lords this afternoon who have suggested that the arts deserve more than a short debate <e> <s> frankly two and a half hours are not enough <e> <s> the arts deserve better than a series of headlines or paragraphs which is mostly what they have received in spite of the achievement of several witty and well-argued speeches within the limit of five minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to the noble lord to the right reverend prelate and to the noble baroness <e> <s> as did the noble lord lord strabolgi i incline to the view of the noble baroness that the order should not be annulled <e> <s> i innocently believe that the best chance of the area remaining an open space is for it to pass to westminster as the order supposes <e>", "<cs> i had intended to make a short and modest contribution in support of the noble lord lord jenkins and i had no idea that as vice-president of the british board of film classification i should be called upon at this late hour for technical advice on the classification of movies <e> <s> in order to get that out of the way as swiftly as i possibly can let me say that so far as concerns the proceedings of the committee should they be issued for sale as a video there are a number of classifications to choose from <e> <s> the most widely accepted and generally regarded as being totally acceptable is called uc which means universally acceptable and especially suitable for children <e> <s> whether one would dare to apply that to the proceedings of the committee i should not dream of saying without seeing the film first <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself in considerable difficulty <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will think it sensible if i briefly share that difficulty <e> <s> i do not suppose that i can be alone in finding this cats <e>", "<cs> my lords this seems a sensible amendment <e> <s> i cannot understand the argument of the noble baroness <e> <s> surely the phrase that precedes this amendment refers to aids <e> <s> that is the way i have read it <e> <s> it is about the spread of disease <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that many years ago there was at the glc a plan for a museum to encompass precisely the essence of this afternoons question <e> <s> there was a plan for a display on a non-permanent and revolving basis of the reserve collections of the nation <e> <s> as at the time the glc unfortunately could not find a suitable site and since as he will doubtless have noticed the glc no longer exists he is in an admirable position to take up the initiative himself <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise most warmly to support the instruction to be moved by the noble lord lord jay <e> <s> to be truthful i came here this afternoon hoping that your lordships would be persuaded not to give this bill a second reading <e> <s> however the reasonableness and extreme clarity of the advice given by the noble baroness lady serota has quite cured me of that impetuosity <e> <s> nevertheless i find the bill extremely troubling <e>", "<cs> my lords i sense a growing excitement among your lordships that the debate may come to an end <e> <s> therefore i shall try not to disappoint the house and delay that moment for too long <e> <s> however i have two worries which concern areas not mentioned in the bill <e> <s> i believe that they should be mentioned and dealt with <e> <s> they concern what may happen in london if the ilea is swept away <e> <s> the first matter relates to the two notable museums the geffrye and the horniman both of which are of national importance and standing <e> <s> it is by chance that up till now they have not been adminstered on a national basis because the glc and now the ilea have administered them <e> <s> however that is not to say that they are not of the importance with which i credit them they are both most distinguished museums <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the solution embodied in the question asked by the noble lord lord st john of fawsley regarding central funding for the horniman and the geffrye coming under the wing of the museum of london which i understand to be willing to act <e>", "<cs> i am sure we all wish the museums every possible success in the future <e> <s> it looks as though that is the way it is going <e> <s> i just hope that the plurality of funding to which the noble baroness referred is not so complicated that the budget falls not between two stools but several stools <e> <s> that is a danger of the current philosophy of plural funding <e> <s> we must hope that those running the geffrye and the horniman museums are skilful enough to see that properly on its way <e> <s> i am most obliged to my noble co-signatories for their support on the amendment <e> <s> in view of the very encouraging response we have had from the noble baroness i hope that the committee will allow me to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to the noble baroness for confirming the governments intention to make the post-abolition musical scene work powerfully as i was urging her to do <e> <s> it only remains for me to say that i echo some of the worries of the noble lord lord donaldson about that <e> <s> it is of course infinitely more complicated than at first appears <e> <s> i can only urge upon the noble baroness that those very talented people in ilea who at present run these matters and who are the repository of knowledge should be put together with all the likely authorities as fast as possible <e> <s> they have a huge task ahead of them and i believe that we should not lose a moment in getting these arrangements in hand <e> <s> i see that the noble baroness is nodding earnestly so i hope that as soon as midnight strikes it will start <e>", "<cs> my lords let me begin by adding my congratulations to those already given by other speakers to the noble marquess on his maiden speech <e> <s> the fact that it was both assured and genial bodes well for the future <e> <s> if that was a maiden speech then i look forward enormously to all his future speeches <e> <s> i was much struck as indeed was the noble lord lord donaldson that he should quote robert tear who is not only a much admired and indeed much loved singer but also a highly intelligent and philosophical being <e> <s> it is sometimes forgotten that performers are capable of philosophy as well as of performance <e>", "<cs> i rise to speak to this amendment i confess mostly out of a worry about what may happen to the arts in westminster as a result of this bill <e> <s> as the noble baroness lady gardner pointed out the arts do very well in westminster <e> <s> westminster has a very large raft of companies and galleries which it supports <e> <s> as has already been mentioned it includes the english national opera and the london festival ballet <e> <s> the committee will not need reminding that those are large companies of national status and international renown <e>", "<cs> my lords i confess to finding myself a little surprised that this debate is taking place at all <e> <s> however since it is i think it perhaps not inappropriate that someone who is a hereditary peer should speak from these benches <e> <s> it is generally supposed that we on these benches have no friends <e> <s> but we have compensations for it we are allowed our independence <e> <s> however sometimes it is removed altogether it only needs the creation of a new peerage for us to be homeless for at least the first part of the afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of that very encouraging reply may one assume that other musical activities closely associated with the centre such as the london schools symphony orchestra instrumental tuition and the junior centres for young musicians may also be assured of a bright future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am immensely obliged to everyone who has taken part in todays debate <e> <s> as the noble earl said few though we were many of the contributions were distinguished and thought-provoking which is exactly what i had hoped <e> <s> obviously in the few last minutes allotted to me i cannot comment in general or in detail on what has been said but there are one or two small points which might just as well be cleared up <e>", "<cs> my lords i can happily be brief as so much has been said so eloquently already <e> <s> i too am grateful to the noble lord lord rees-mogg for introducing this debate <e> <s> he asked for reassurance from the government on three points but the debate has brought up two vastly important points of principle <e> <s> one concerns independence and the other concerns the degree of devolution in this matter <e> <s> everyone seems to welcome devolution and indeed it looks reactionary and undemocratic not to do so <e> <s> however the exact degree of it depends as the noble lord lord rees-mogg pointed out at the beginning of this debate entirely on the quality of to whom one hands over <e> <s> the noble lord lord jenkins of putney was brave enough to point out that it is often the case that devolution involves handing over responsibility from a reasonably efficient body to a series of inefficient bodies <e> <s> at any rate that has been known to happen <e> <s> of the two principles i have referred to obviously independence is by far the most important and any erosion of that principle would be by far the most dangerous <e>", "<cs> i wish to amplify some of the things that the noble lord lord willis has said <e> <s> the committee will understand that the procedure of taking the prs fee or a share of it is one that is generally understood in music publishing to be the standard practice <e> <s> in the ordinary sense of the term publishers often take not per cent <e> <s> but usually in the region of per cent <e> <s> for services rendered to the composer over a whole range of musical activities <e>", "<cs> i do not know if it will help if i suggest that the problem in relation to what the noble earl has suggested is already a solution to these difficulties the office of fair trading is that touched on by the noble lord lord willis of providing that body with the information and evidence required <e> <s> the noble lord lord willis hinted that it requires a great deal of courage for a young unknown composer to provide that evidence <e> <s> that is why i feel it would not be amiss to include something in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that at the recent manchester olympic festival of which i was a director a huge russian connection was made and that therefore a large number of visas were required for artistes curators and other soviet citizens <e> <s> since they were invariably forthcoming in our diplomatic staff in moscow there must be a considerable range of expertise hard work and good will upon which future plans can be made <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the noble lord lord willis <e> <s> he has outlined the abuse that we are all determined to get rid of <e> <s> at least i am sure that no member of the committee considers such abuse worthy of support <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord annan has outlined the problem very clearly and eloquently <e> <s> i quarrel with it not at all <e> <s> however i am in a rather difficult position because grouped with these two amendments is amendment no <e> <s> in my name and that of the noble lord lord colwyn <e> <s> although i believe that the noble lord lord annan has set out the problem very clearly before your lordships his solution is too radical <e> <s> effectively his solution means that no
