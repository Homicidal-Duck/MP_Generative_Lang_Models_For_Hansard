["<cs> my lords it is a great indulgence on the part of your lordships house to permit me to intervene with a maiden speech in a debate on such an important subject as economic affairs <e> <s> the right reverend prelates speech will certainly not have disappointed the courteous expectations of the noble lord lord byers and i shall try not to let him down too much <e> <s> happily or unhappily the customs and usages of this house make it very difficult for me to take up some of the points made by noble lords on both sides of the house and by the noble baroness lady birk controversial matters or most of them will have to wait for another day <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate the noble lord lord mcfadzean of kelvinside on a speech of characteristic good sense <e> <s> it is quire clear that the noble lord lord marsh is going to make a positive and enlivening contribution to the proceedings of your lordships house in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me i did read it all in the newspaper <e>", "<cs> my lords i too have to declare an interest as a member of a company which is a major supplier of telecommunications equipment <e> <s> the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but does he realise that the terms of the licence which will be granted to bt are a vital part of the financial consideration which will be paid over by outside investors to the government for the shares in bt and will deal with precisely those criticisms which the noble lord lord mcintosh was making earlier about how much it will in fact cost the community to privatise bt <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord again but i did not say that bt should be prohibited from manufacturing <e> <s> i asked only for the same assurances for our indigenous manufacturers as are given by foreign telecommunications authorities to their manufacturers <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord lord cockfield perhaps agree that the strongest argument against this amendment is that it makes no material difference to what is basically a rather unsatisfactory bill <e>", "<cs> the amendment puts forward an extremely attractive idea which the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has demonstrated to be quite impracticable <e> <s> but even if it were not so there is another reason why i suggest that your lordships should not accept this amendment <e> <s> anybody who can be thought of as applying for this appointment is almost certainly unfit to discharge it <e> <s> i cannot imagine a situation in which a queue of applicants was forthcoming who would be suitable and who could be put before a select committee in the way suggested <e> <s> furthermore it would give a further disincentive to a suitable person if such exists which i rather doubt if he was required prior to his appointment by <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> i do not want noble lords to think that i rise merely to the challenge but a great deal is being said about who is responsible for what without any evidence whatever to support it <e> <s> it is not in fact the case that suppliers supply what they want to supply to customers <e> <s> customers buy what they want <e> <s> the suppliers sold to british telecommunications and to the post office its predecessor what they insisted upon having and not what the industry dictated to them that they should have <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way a second time <e> <s> there were no other fish to fry <e> <s> as a result of the insistence by the post office and susbsequently by british telecom on the equipment which they specified all our other fish were drowned or lost at sea <e> <s> we lost our export markets because as has been said by noble lords on both sides of the committee we did not have modern equipment to sell and we did not have modern equipment because british telecom and its predecessor would not buy it <e> <s> at the point when it decided to stray from strowger which was some years ago it changed to a system called txe the relay electronic exchange which was not really electronic but was another electromechanical exchange <e> <s> that was not saleable in overseas markets and none was sold <e> <s> that decision was made between british telecom and one of its <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether other noble lords are as puzzled as i am at the general drift of the argument that the committee is taking <e> <s> as i understood him the noble lord lord glenarthur accepted as valid the objects which the amendment strives for and rejected it only on the ground that in some cases there was justification for discrimination <e> <s> does not the noble lord consider that the government are better placed to accept the principle put forward in the amendment and to consider altering the bill in due course rather than drive noble lords who otherwise might vote against the amendment to vote for it <e>", "<cs> with due respect to the noble lord i am sure his concern is very real but some practical expression of it in the form of an undertaking that the government will cover it in the bill in due course would be very welcome <e>", "<cs> as noble lords will have noticed in making his answer the minister leaned heavily upon the licence or what he called the licence <e> <s> i ask your lordships to remember that there is no licence there is only a draft licence <e> <s> in the explanatory notes on the draft licence one reads that the draft is not the final text of the licence <e> <s> i hope noble lords will bear this in mind when we come to consider later amendments <e>", "<cs> i am glad to hear the noble lord lord cockfield concede the principle that the interests of manufacturers even if it has not been included in the bill could have been properly included <e> <s> but i am afraid i cannot follow him in his reading of clause with reference to clause unless he be referring to subsection <e>", "<cs> with due respect to the noble lord <e> <s> lord morris the government have already <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord cockfield for that detailed exposition of the exact meaning of the words in the proposed legislation all of which i think i understand and appreciate <e> <s> but it seems to me that the noble lord has missed the point of my interjection which was that it is not enough to talk about manufacturers as persons engaged in manufacture in the united kingdom because there are such persons operating in the united kingdom frequently with a subsidy from the british government to back their actitivities merely as assembly units or as arms of foreign firms seeking entry into either the united kingdom market or the european community <e> <s> the reference that i understand the noble lord lord bruce was seeking through his amendment and the reference that i am seeking is some commitment in respect of british manufacturers as distinct from foreign manufacturers with operations be they large or small in britain <e>", "<cs> can the noble and learned lord tell me whether his interpretation of what would be a normal competitive act by a small firm and an anticompetitive act by a big firm is somewhere defined in law <e> <s> or is he merely giving us his personal <e>", "<cs> the objective of the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord bruce seems to stem from the belief that the present arrangements are intrinsically satisfactory <e> <s> i have not heard expressed by noble lords opposite the government any view that they are not <e> <s> it seems to me that noble lords proposing the amendment have overlooked the fact that the removal of telephone boxes will be quite expensive <e> <s> it is a disincentive for companies seeking to he profitable to do it <e> <s> even if the amendment is carried i am afraid that the fears of the noble lord lord ezra are unlikely to be satisfied since it would merely substitute one set of words for another <e>", "<cs> i could not support the amendment put down by the noble lord lord bruce simply because i do not think reciprocal agreements have necessarily any practical effect <e> <s> it is one thing to make reciprocal agreements between nations or governments it is quite another to get people to buy as much from you as you are buying from them <e> <s> there is a subsequent amendment no <e> <s> which i will support and to which i will speak which i think deals with the situation more appropriately <e>", "<cs> in generally supporting what the noble viscount lord trenchard has said i want to say that i think amendment no <e> <s> is especially important <e> <s> i apologise for detaining your lordships at such a late hour but this is the only place i can identify in the bill where the position of manufacturing industry can be mentioned specifically to be falling within the general responsibilities of the secretary of state and the director general under clause <e> <s> it is rather important therefore that it should be considered seriously <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord insist that amendment no <e> <s> is contrary to our international obligations <e> <s> does the noble lord realise that the monopoly purchaser buying from more than one supplier when he has the opportunity to import is entirely different from somebody buying motor-cars where there is a multiplicity of suppliers and a multiplicity of buyers <e>", "<cs> with due respect to the noble lord lord cockfield can it be against our international obligations to legislate to ensure a fair international competitive position <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord lord morris wants to find some words which have no meaning he certainly identifies a good paragraph <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord cockfield is certainly an authority on matters of abuse <e>", "<cs> why withdraw it <e>", "<cs> has the noble lord the minister noted that this committee has spent some hours looking at amendments to understand this clear and precise clause to which he has three or four times made reference in his last reply <e>", "<cs> in view of the earlier tenor of discussion in committee i have been agreeably surprised by the atmosphere of light and constructiveness that has pervaded the committees deliberations today <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will grant me indulgence in that my lack of experience in parliamentary affairs does not leave me entirely clear whether the assurance given by the noble lord lord cockfield means that the licence will be laid before parliament and will be discussed and approved by parliament before it becomes effective and that the terms of the licence will not be settled between bt and the secretary of state in any way that will affect the placing of shares in british telecommunications plc until that has happened <e>", "<cs> i find myself in agreement with a great deal of what the noble lord lord cockfield had to say in reply to the amendment <e> <s> those noble lords who have referred to the system in hull would find themselves restricted to local calls from hull if it were not for the bt network <e> <s> the noble lord referred to a statement made by his right honourable friend in another place and himself pointed out the difficulties in trying to sell the separate parts of british telecom because of administrative problems accounting problems and so on <e> <s> does the noble lord think that those difficulties will not arise in fulfilling the requirements of conditions and of the licence which refer to cross-subsidy and the keeping of separate accounts for the separate activities of bt <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the noble lord lord cockfield will need a great deal of further explanation as to the relevance of the amendment and we shall hear from him shortly whether the government are sympathetic to it or not <e> <s> i wanted to raise a subsidiary point really to get information <e> <s> under the provisions of this clause clause and of clause the government will undertake and underwrite very considerable financial obligations and they will do so on an open-ended basis <e> <s> there is no indication of the amount of the continuing liability involved <e> <s> what is more that liability can be increased <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord grimond has shot my fox and mown down a great many other animals at the same time <e> <s> there is widespread support for the idea of wider share ownership <e> <s> the trouble is that this amendment applies to a particular company <e> <s> i hope that the noble lords on the government front bench will think it worth while referring their right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer to this widespread feeling in support of wider share ownership in the hope that he may in his next budget do such things as may make this possible for a great many other companies besides british telecom <e>", "<cs> am i to understand from what the noble lord said with regard to the first of the three points he mentioned namely that the transfer which is to take place will be to the british people from the amorphous state ownership in which it is presently held that no attempt will be made to market shares in british telecom pic on wall street or anywhere else outside the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> if we can return from the realms of economic debate to the bill clause refers to shares and the noble lord lord cockfield mentioned equity it may be that it will not be only equity in the event to be allotted to the government as a consequence of the vesting of the undertaking of bt in the successor company british telecommunications pic <e> <s> some noble lords may have seen a copy of the memorandum of association for british telecommunications pic <e> <s> that document certainly does not lack for flexibility giving powers to operate any sort of business from a betting shop to a boarding-house <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble lord i myself have not been to the library but a colleague has done so he has obtained the memorandum of association but not the articles of association <e>", "<cs> i do not want to press the noble lord unduly and i am sorry to have to persist with this <e> <s> is it to be expected that restrictions on the rights attaching to the per cent <e> <s> will be written into the articles or some other authoritative documents which will make clear the rights of the per cent <e> <s> of the shares which are to be sold to third parties <e>", "<cs> in that case would it be the intention for example in the resolution proposing the appointment or dismissal of directors to use their per cent <e> <s> in the vote <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord lord cockfield is yet in a position to reply to the point i raised earlier when we were discussing amendment no <e> <s> concerning the elements of subsidy inherent in the bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for that full explanation <e> <s> is the noble and learned lord satisfied that the situation in british telecom plc in which some employees have index-linked pensions and other employees do not will prove satisfactory <e>", "<cs> the purpose of this amendment is to enable the government to offer shares in bt plc to the public on a simple application form which does not comply with the requirements of the companies acts and the prevention of fraud investments act <e> <s> it is probably intended that forms of application will be enclosed with telephone bills <e> <s> i submit to your lordships that it is quite wrong that the elaborate code of investor protection contained in those acts should be cast aside simply because the government are the sellers <e> <s> there can be no justification for having one set of rules for the secretary of state when he wants to offer shares to the public and another set of rules for everyone else <e> <s> in any case there is an inevitable conflict of interest if the secretary of state is doing his duty <e> <s> on the one hand he must get as much as possible for the public property he is selling in the form of bt shares <e> <s> on the other hand he must through the licence and the regulatory procedure protect the public and others against monopoly practice by british telecom plc <e> <s> it follows that the conditions to be imposed on the operations of bt plc must have an important bearing on the value of the shares and must be disclosed in detail to prospective purchasers <e> <s> for the reasons i have given and in the light of other experience <e> <s> i ask your lordships to reject this amendment so that potential investors would have the full and normal protection of the law in this matter <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord is faithful to the belief of his party in wider share ownership and if he thinks that this is the way in which shares should be sold should his government not advocate this method of selling shares more generally <e> <s> why should it be restricted to this single bill <e>", "<cs> with due respect i do not <e> <s> i think that investors need a certain amount of protection and the offerings by the government of shareholdings in other companies do not fill one brimful with confidence <e> <s> i would not suggest for a second that there would be anything defective in the prospectus <e> <s> but if the law prescribes that a certain degree of protection is necessary for investors i cannot see why an exception should be made in this case <e> <s> surely the same protection should be afforded to investors who want to put money into bt plc as would apply to any other company <e>", "<cs> the very large number of prospectuses that will be required in this matter is a consequence of the very large sum of money that is involved <e> <s> is that any reason to abrogate the law <e>", "<cs> surely the noble and learned lord the lord advocate would agree that what he is suggesting is an abrogation of the requirements of the law for protecting investors in the interests of administrative convenience <e> <s> i should have thought that that was the last thing the committee ought to agree to <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord consider that that has nothing at all to do with the fact that there are a great many more people unemployed now than there were then and thus the demand for new telephones may not have risen at the same rate as previously <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interfere in what is rather a private matter between the two front benches between which i am sandwiched but i should like to ask the noble lord whether he can <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel obliged to intervene as i supported the amendment which now appears in the bill against the government at committee stage on the grounds that the government seemed impervious to suggestions coming from all sides of the chamber that the matters of which the <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house it seems to be rather a pity that the house does not avail itself of the generous offer of the noble lord lord cockfield to accept these amendments <e> <s> one of the difficulties which industrialists and other people have in dealing with acts of parliament and other fomal documents is to know precisely what the words in them mean <e> <s> the words as at present drafted in the bill are not particularly clear <e> <s> the words proposed in the amendment are much clearer and although we have just had the noble earl lord halsburys definition of the tautologous nature of the dead corpse these amendments include the words effective competition or to compete effectively and i understood that to mean that the secretary of state will help us to compete effectively with foreign competition <e> <s> that is something which i welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment may or may not be suitable to achieve the result which the mover the noble lord <e> <s> lord orr-ewing desires <e> <s> but what is certainly the case is that there has been difficulty in obtaining frequencies for civil use <e> <s> if the frequencies which could be made available are not made available to those who wish to use them in free and fair competition the degree of fair competition will be limited in ways which the bill does not contemplate <e> <s> i therefore commend to the government whether or not they accept the amendment <e> <s> that this is a matter which is worth their consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down i wonder whether i can ask him if he is telling the house that what matters so far as this legislation is concerned is not the bill and is not even the licence but is the arbitrary interpretation put upon the licence by the director general <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not share the optimistic expectation of the noble lord lord mottistone of what may be the position of british telecom in the st century in relation to its size in comparison with its competitors <e> <s> several amendments were tabled at the committee stage which sought to prevent unfair competition by public telecommunications operators not only bt resulting from subsidies for their network businesses to their supply or manufacturing businesses or between the latter two <e> <s> the scope for abuse is very wide <e> <s> for example costs like connection charges for new terminal equipment or maintenance for an initial period could be recovered in high call tariffs established at an early stage an option which is not available to any of bts competitors or potential competitors <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord withdraws his amendment may i point out that the duty put upon the director <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon and the noble lord lord ezra for appearing to bite the hand which is attempting to feed me <e> <s> but i see no particular reason why the proceeds of any particular measure the sale of government assets or of state-owned assets should be applied to any particular purpose <e> <s> while i hope that the government will support in the future as they have i must acknowledge in the past these new industries and the development of new technologies which will come in the future at an ever-increasing rate i do not think that this amendment is an appropriate way in which to secure that object <e> <s> as much as i sympathise with its aims and the desire of noble lords to see that our industry is kept up to date with such financial help as would be appropriate from the government i do not consider that this amendment is the proper means to achieve those objectives <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down i must apologise to the noble lord lord bruce of donington for the fact that i did not hear his opening remarks concerning this amendment <e> <s> i did not know that amendments nos <e> <s> and would be considered with amendment no <e>

my lords i must first apologise to the noble lord lord cockfield that i was not in the chamber to hear his opening speech <e> <s> this was due to a malfunction of information services which caused me to believe that the statement would be made <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord realise that jobs are protected or created in this country at no cost at all when the government and the great national industries buy the production of british factories instead of the production of foreign ones <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first apologise for i have been unavoidably detained elsewhere for the greater part of the day and therefore i have had to miss so much of the debate <e> <s> i have heard much wisdom <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that there are cases where it is a matter of price <e> <s> the most recent example that i can think of is the importation of electronic scales from japan <e> <s> the common market authorities decided there was dumping in this country to the extent of per cent <e> <s> i believe that a duty of per cent <e> <s> has now been imposed after many months delay <e> <s> we have been waiting for over three years to get approval for our scales from the weights and measures authorities in japan <e> <s> that is the sort of matter of which i was complaining <e>", "<cs> my lords i have first to add my congratulations and thanks to those of other noble lords to the noble viscount lord torrington and his committee for this informative and timely report <e> <s> the noble lord lord marshall of goring gave the house a clear and authoritative exposition of the dramatic events which occurred at chernobyl and dealt in simple terms with the question uppermost in every lay mind why shouldnt it happen here <e> <s> it will not

congratulations to the noble lord lord fairhaven on his maiden speech in which he stated the position of the jockey club with great cogency and to the noble viscount lord head on a really impressive

also sorry to have learnt of the death of the mover of the bill in another place <e>", "<cs> the members of the committee have been mostly concerned in what they have been saying with office property
