["<cs> i crave the indulgence of the committee <e> <s> i had no intention of making a maiden speech during the committee stage of a bill <e> <s> nor when i came into the chamber this afternoon did i intend making a speech <e> <s> however this subject has interested me for a number of years <e> <s> i have listened to the debate and i think that it is probably a proper occasion for me to say something which i hope will not be regarded as too controversial but which will according to the rules give members who follow me an opportunity to say that they hope to hear me again on some future occasion <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has stressed the point about individuals <e> <s> i wonder whether it would not be more realistic in northern ireland terms to say that it would be very unlikely that an individual would bring such an accusation but more likely that a group of people would bring an accusation <e> <s> as i understand it there is nothing in the bill as drafted to prevent a group of people members of the locality where the council sits from bringing such an accusation if they wish to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that my experience of northern ireland is that nothing is absolutely sure or unsure <e> <s> one can never be quite certain how anything will work <e> <s> certainly for an englishman to assess the likely consequences of a certain measure in northern ireland is an extraordinarily dangerous thing to do <e>", "<cs> that is grossly unfair <e>", "<cs> my lords i am following the argument of the noble lord very carefully <e> <s> one accepts of course that there is intimidation in northern ireland <e> <s> on the other hand there is an extraordinary number of very brave and honourable people who are not intimidated <e> <s> the noble lord lord fitt is one of them <e> <s> he has never been intimidated <e> <s> some members of the ulster defence regiment have never been intimidated <e> <s> there are catholic policemen serving with the royal ulster constabulary who have never been intimidated <e> <s> i do not believe that the fear of intimidation in this particular case is as high as it is in a number of other cases particularly with businessmen who experience a loss of profits through intimidation <e> <s> but i believe that in northern ireland there will always be a sufficient number of people who despite possible intimidation will stand up for what they believe to be right <e> <s> i have always thought that was one of the strongest points in favour of the people of northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief as well <e> <s> in the other place it is usual to make your speech regardless of how many others have made it before because you want to get it into the local newspaper and your constituents need to know exactly what your views are <e> <s> luckily in your lordships house there is no such need <e> <s> therefore it is quite unnecessary to repeat a great deal of what has already been said in a far more eminent intellectual and intelligent way than i could possibly manage <e>", "<cs> my lords i declare an interest in that my company gec employs many people in hong kong <e> <s> it also carries out many contracts which involve exports to hong kong and therefore employs many people in this country as a result of such business <e> <s> i welcome the governments statement and i recognise the sensitive and difficult issues involved in what they are seeking to do <e> <s> they should have our wholehearted support in what they have put forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very pleased to follow the noble lord but i do so with a good deal of trepidation because he has a lifetime of experience in higher education and particularly university education and i have practically none <e> <s> when i was up at cambridge i believe that the noble lord was a tutor at kings <e> <s> at that time one of his pupils was mr simon raven the novelist <e> <s> he and i have shared an interest of one sort or another in mr simon raven and his writing ever since <e> <s> sometimes we have wished to disown him but on other occasions we have perhaps been quite proud of what he has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have any objection to answering that <e> <s> very nearly everyone has a car now <e> <s> however i want people to regard a car a house and a college as all being important parts of their future careers and aspirations <e> <s> that is what is important <e> <s> if after having obtained a car they prefer to travel by train that will suit gec even better <e>", "<cs> my lords what the noble lord has just said is simply not true <e> <s> i might wish that it was but it is not <e>", "<cs> my lords it can certainly be said that your lordships house is an oasis of calm discussing rural society at a time when the lower house might be discussing more frenetic activities <e> <s> i do not wish to disturb that oasis of calm but i wish to thank those noble lords who have been kind enough to say that the commissions report <e>"]
