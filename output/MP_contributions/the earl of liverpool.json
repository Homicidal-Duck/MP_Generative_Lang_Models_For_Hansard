["<cs> my lords this is the first opportunity that i have had to speak on this bill in your lordships house and i should like to apologise to the noble lord lord campbell and the whole house for not being present at second reading or the report stage <e> <s> my absence was due to long-standing business engagements <e> <s> there are certain aspects of this legislation which the noble lord lord campbell knows do concern me and i am extremely grateful to him for sparing the time to discuss some of them with me yesterday <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support the amendment and the noble lord lord campbell of alloway <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indebted to my noble friend lord campbell for putting down this amendment at a late hour and speaking to it <e> <s> without it it was my understanding that pubs and other unlicensed premises would be taken out of this bill and the gaming act <e> <s> they would effectively have been consigned to a sort of no-mans-land with no means of renewing their permit <e> <s> i am satisfied the amendment covers the point and i am happy to support it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am somewhat concerned about this amendment because if i understand it correctly it would be possible for an arcade to switch off machines which are covered by this bill <e> <s> if they did that they could still have video machines which are not so covered pool tables and other forms of recreation operational and children of any age could go into these places unaccompanied by a parent or guardian <e> <s> i think that this is an anomaly because the main thrust of the bill as i understand it is first of all to protect children from a gambling addiction if that is what occurs and also to protect them from child sexual abuse <e> <s> it is unlikely i admit that an arcade would switch off its machines hut if it did am i right in thinking that what i have suggested would obtain <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend on the front bench aware that i have almost as close an interest in this matter as does my noble friend lord mersey <e> <s> can he say therefore whether the projects in train will lead to a wider environmental clean-up of the area <e> <s> can he also tell the house whether there is to be a contribution from the ec and if so at what level <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to join other noble lords in expressing my gratitude to my noble friend lord holderness for enabling us to discuss this matter tonight <e> <s> the whole question of the nuclear industry programme and the way in which it deals with waste is i believe of great concern not only to those people who live in proximity to the four sites which it is proposed nirex will investigate but to all of us in this country <e> <s> the chernobyl factor has of course only heightened that concern <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in thanking my noble friend lord cranbrook for enabling us to discuss this matter tonight and so clearly outlining the contents of the report <e> <s> i should also like to say how much i enjoyed listening to the speech of the noble lord lord bridges <e> <s> it is apparent to me that he knows a great deal more about the subject than i do and most of your lordships also <e> <s> as i say i am not an expert in this matter <e> <s> however as i grow a little greyer i grow a little greener <e> <s> i am happy to find myself in such good company <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the advantages of speaking low down in the batting order is that one has the benefit of listening to some excellent speeches which cover all the points that one should have liked to make oneself <e> <s> moreover with dinner approaching one is perhaps encouraged to be brief which i promise to be <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join other noble lords in thanking my noble friend lord kimball for initiating this debate and thereby giving us an opportunity to consider the report by the monopolies and mergers commission which took about two and a half years to produce and which some of us have been having difficulty digesting since its publication in march <e> <s> i should like to say how interesting i found the speech of the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal and how closely in tune i felt with everything she had to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for correcting me <e> <s> when one considers that more than per cent <e> <s> of the retail cost of a pint sold goes to the government that is p on every pint producing an annual income to the exchequer of billion or per cent <e> <s> of gdp we have not done badly <e> <s> it is also worth noting that well over half a billion pounds is invested annually by brewers in improvement to their pubs <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for allowing me to intervene again or at least to reply to him <e> <s> i was referring to the -year period when prices rose by per cent <e> <s> in real terms <e> <s> if one applies an average percentage increase that comes to a little over per cent <e> <s> per annum <e> <s> given the enormous increase in that same period in the contribution to the exchequer that has been made from the price of a pint through duty and vat i do not think that that is in any way unreasonable <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indebted to the noble baroness lady robson of kiddington for introducing the bill and for the clear and precise way in which she has outlined its objectives <e> <s> i have no doubt that we all share a deep concern about the manufacture of chlorofluorocarbons and the grave danger that they present to the ozone layer once released into the upper atmosphere <e> <s> in my view no effort should be spared to curtail and eliminate the use of cfcs and that is why i welcome the bill <e> <s> however the problem is global and the bill seeks to legislate only for england scotland and northern ireland as is within our power in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend and the house for allowing me to intervene <e> <s> i apologise for so doing <e> <s> i shall be brief i declare an interest as the director of a regional brewery company and therefore it will come as no surprise to your lordships to find that i agree with much of what my noble friend lord kimball said <e>"]
