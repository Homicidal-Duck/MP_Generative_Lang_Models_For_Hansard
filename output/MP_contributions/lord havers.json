["<cs> i hope that the committee will forgive me for feeling a little strange <e> <s> this is the first time that i have spoken from the back benches for almost exactly years <e> <s> on th november i became solicitor-general <e>", "<cs> it appears that twice in the same afternoon i am going to give your lordships committee the benefit of my personal experience <e> <s> i have had quite a lot of experience of jury challenging and have found that there were occasions when there appeared to be no explanation at all <e> <s> i think the case of which the noble and learned lord lord denning speaks the smart suit and the <e>", "<cs> i should like to say to my noble friend the minister that i have a slight anxiety concerning the words in parenthesis <e> <s> i agree with the noble and learned lord lord simon and i should be content if the matter was dealt with today in the form of an undertaking from the minister that the matter will be looked at again by the draftsman <e>", "<cs> i am a little surprised by the use made by my noble friend of the word complements as regards the other two amendments <e> <s> i think that the amendment does much more than that <e> <s> it seems to me to be an essential part of the general reform <e> <s> it is the sale as the noble and learned lord has already pointed out which is the most important point <e> <s> it is often said that there would be no thieves without receivers <e> <s> if we can get rid of the sellers it may be that those who would be in possession of these hideous weapons would not find them readily available <e> <s> i think that this is an absolutely key part of the whole reform and i am delighted that it has been brought forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene because i was slightly concerned about the speech of the noble and learned lord lord ackner <e> <s> what i say is designed to be helpful to the minister <e> <s> i had read amendment no <e> <s> subsection m as meaning evidence in its true sense and therefore fitting with the abolition of the <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first of all say about the second amendment which has not yet been called that i agree with it although i do not think that it is necessary <e> <s> i think the power exists with the judge <e> <s> i should just like to remind the noble lord lord wigoder of what i believe to be the position <e> <s> although the judge sitting in chambers can control who attends him in chambers there is nothing binding upon those who have heard that hearing to stop them from going outside and repeating it to anybody they like <e> <s> there is a problem even in chambers although not in camera <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord is absolutely right head of the bar <e> <s> if that is the only slip of the tongue i am content <e>", "<cs> my lords may i assist the noble lord <e> <s> there had not been guidelines for stand by until this bill was in its preliminary stage its committee stage in the house of commons and the discussion about stand by came up <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls <e> <s> we always complain about statutes being too big <e> <s> here we are adding yet another sentence <e> <s> i should have thought that subsection covers everything perfectly well <e> <s> i have spent eight years considering statutes in draft <e> <s> subsection imposes a duty that is quite clear and will be well understood by the secretary of state and the home office whatever government are in power <e> <s> the addition of these words is unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords in principle i have great sympathy with this amendment <e> <s> i think that it will concentrate the minds of the civil servants and the minister very well <e> <s> it may be of great assistance in considering whether there should be a judicial review <e>", "<cs> my lords i am concerned about what the noble lord has told your lordships <e> <s> the amendment says <e>", "<cs> i wish to make a short plea on behalf of the lawyers by which i mean the barristers and the solicitors <e> <s> they always have an enormous problem advising their clients <e> <s> as has been said by both noble and learned lords fair dealing has a meaning which is well understood <e> <s> if we change those words we shall again open up the gates to having it redefined by the courts all the way to your lordships judicial committee <e> <s> i beg the committee not to expose lawyers to that <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps he can give the committee some examples of other occasions on which it would not be subject to copyright <e> <s> there are two examples set out in the bill <e> <s> the amendment is obviously intended to widen that enormously <e> <s> perhaps he can say what occasions he is thinking of <e>", "<cs> i make a simple plea for those who must read the bill when it becomes law <e> <s> i ask the government to find a new clause which is spread over more than a page of the marshalled list and which raises complications which i find difficult <e> <s> i should like to ask my noble friend to consider whether he can shorten the clause into a more readable and easily understood form before the report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i was still in practice at the bar when the benson royal commission was appointed in <e> <s> i was attorney-general when the <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl allow me to correct one thing that the noble lord lord annan said <e> <s> not every member of the maguire family was found positive in the nitroglycerine test <e> <s> one of the sons who was in and out of the house during the afternoon which turned out to be a significant factor in the case was not there the whole time and his hands were clean <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a most interesting debate and i suspect that little more can be said on the subject <e> <s> therefore i shall be brief <e> <s> i should like first to congratulate the two front bench speakers on their restraint and on the lucidity of their arguments <e> <s> i know that the noble lord lord mishcon will appreciate that i do not agree with his conclusions <e> <s> however i very much agree with what has been said by my noble friend lord campbell of alloway and by my noble and learned friend lord hailsham <e>", "<cs> i have knowledge of a case in which a member of the bar who had improperly pleaded something he should not have done was made to pay the costs <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> i have been a great believer in the cab rank rule <e> <s> if i may say it to his face the noble lord lord hutchinson of all whom i know at the bar has been the most firm devotee to the rule <e> <s> one has many times seen him doing such work because he believed in it <e>", "<cs> when i was attorney-general i became increasingly dissatisfied with the system that operated at the central criminal court as regards <e>", "<cs> my lords in my opinion the noble earls view is right it should be the secretary of state who decides the amount <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble baroness will give way for one moment <e> <s> that was the alternative method of proceeding the public good <e> <s> but the position with the attorney general was such that it convinced me that it was a way which was not satisfactory <e> <s> that is why i used section of the criminal contempt act <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> i am disappointed that he has not accepted either of the amendments <e> <s> i should like time to consider his reply and to discuss it with members of the bbc whom i have consulted <e> <s> i may wish to return to the matter but meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>"]
