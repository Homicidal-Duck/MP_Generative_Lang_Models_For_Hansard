["<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he allow me to say this <e> <s> i unfortunately like so many noble lords remember well my distress as a much younger man when i heard exactly what the noble lord has just been saying but in a different context in terms of bombing cities and so on as opposed to nuclear weapons <e> <s> i remember exactly the same arguments being produced in and as those that the noble lord has now put forward <e> <s> we have been caught once and we were very nearly caught completely at that time because we were ready to accept the sincerity of an opponent who in fact had no sincerity whatsoever in terms of his own plans for conquest <e> <s> nothing that the noble lord has said has persuaded me otherwise and this is the question i should like to ask him <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that mr brezhnevs expression of sincerity may be just as insincere as those of the people who were threatening us in and <e>", "<cs> may i make a suggestion <e> <s> on the question of the destruction of prints could not the prints be returned to the detainee on his being released <e> <s> this has been done in terms of fingerprints and other confidential documents of those who had records against them from the gestapo in the war <e> <s> the british intelligence took a great deal of trouble to hand those documents back to those who were still in a position to receive them <e> <s> i do not see any reason why such a simple procedure as that should not get over the problem of making sure that the records have been destroyed <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him to attend to a particular point of fact because i am sure he does not wish to be inaccurate <e> <s> to the best of my knowledge i believe that although the institute of directors may support the <e>", "<cs> my lords i would really like to put a question if i may to my noble friend lord vaizey because there are many of us extremely interested in this problem and it has never been entirely clear how it works <e> <s> the question i want to ask is this <e> <s> we have been discussing mostly houses pubs and shops which might or might not be made available for accommodation <e> <s> but of course the preservation orders cover a much wider range of buildings <e> <s> though your lordships may well suppose that what i am going to say is not intended to be taken seriously i can assure your lordships that in terms of finance and money it is so <e>"]
