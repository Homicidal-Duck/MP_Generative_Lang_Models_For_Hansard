["<cs> my lords i hope that it will not be felt that i am stepping outside the bounds of this motion which i naturally support if i talk about western trade with the soviet union and the soviet <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i with respect question whether that is quite good enough with no arrangement whatsoever for parliament itself to monitor the behaviour of the communist governments with regard to their promises arising out of the helsinki final act or even to hold regular debates in government time in either house <e> <s> could not consideration be given to the setting up of a joint select committee which would have the advantage both of relieving pressure on another place which has in all conscience set up enough committees recently and of taking advantage of the very considerable experience of members of the upper house in this respect <e> <s> would the government look with favour on a possibility <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord referred to the committee which was chaired by my noble friend lord caccia <e> <s> however is the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful indeed for that reply which has certainly relieved a good many anxieties arising from the failure to mention the countryside in the queens speech <e> <s> but can my noble friend go a little further and tell the house when legislation is likely to be presented and whether it is the governments intention to get it on to the statute book during this session <e> <s> secondly can my noble friend give an assurance that there will be very wide consultation not only with the statutory bodies but with voluntary bodies concerned with the scenic beauty and the scientific importance of the countryside <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that when we have a chance to look at these figures they will be very disturbing indeed <e> <s> is not one of the main reasons for that the fact that some major industries persist with long out-dated restrictive practices <e> <s> if my noble friend agrees will he say how the government see their role in helping and encouraging industry that is management and unions to get rid of restrictive practices as well as creating a climate in which industry can again flourish <e>", "<cs> my lords while naturally being glad that the government are being so firm about this question may i ask my noble friend for an assurance that he will not enter into an agreement with the french government which could possibly damage the interests of new zealand in this respect in view of the great importance of the british market indeed of the whole community market to new zealand <e> <s> in other words putting it more simply that there will be no horse trading in lamb <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether he could say the briefest word about the scale on which international aid is likely to be available for zimbabwe-rhodesia after the return to legality <e> <s> also to what extent is he satisfied that this will match reasonably well with their needs bearing in mind the parlous state of the economy after many years of sanctions and civil war <e>", "<cs> my lords while feeling that europe can hardly be looked at in isolation where these matters are concerned may i ask my noble friend to comment on the fact that the soviet invasion of afghanistan and the chaos in iran after the revolution have highlighted yet again the imperative need for nato to cease to regard its area of responsibility as bounded by the tropic of cancer <e> <s> may i ask my noble friend whether he can say what has been the outcome of the very long talks that have been going on for some seven or eight years in nato in considering this question <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that encouraging reply <e> <s> does it mean not only that the kremlins sins will not automatically be visited on the formerly independent countries of eastern and central europe but that among them too there is a clear case for discrimination based perhaps on the degree of support they give to the soviet union and the extent to which they comply with their promises under the helsinki final act and should not such a policy be reflected in the provision of credits for instance to poland whose government measures are very well known in both respects and whose shortage of hard currency is very severe indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord gore-booth always makes a deeply thoughtful and interesting speech and today i find myself in complete agreement with everything that he said <e> <s> i am not sure what he meant at the beginning when he said that he was not a professional speaker <e> <s> i feel sure that if he were thinking of turning pro he would make a good living <e> <s> there can be very few if any noble lords who have not been encouraged by the speech by the prime minister in another place last week and by my noble friend the foreign secretary in this debate <e> <s> for myself i welcome the initiatives that the british government have taken in nato and in the european community initiatives which i think are admirable positive and firm without being doctrinaire <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for that reply which is <e>", "<cs> my lords now that i have had more time to think about my noble friends answer is he aware that the quite small capital sums which he has announced will be made available will be completely inadequate to make sure that the bbcs output which is widely acclaimed as perhaps the best in the world will be audible in a very large part of the soviet union and at this particular time is that not a most regrettable thing <e>", "<cs> my lords in their reactions to the situation in iran and in afghanistan the united states and the european community have shown some very clear signs of being seriously out of step <e> <s> is my noble friend giving some careful thought at present i am not asking him to make a definite statement now to the need to improve the machinery for political cooperation between the community and the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend accept that wavelengths lost are almost certainly lost for ever that audiences lost are very hard indeed to recapture and that therefore it would be quite wrong to describe any cuts that are made as temporary <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put two short questions to my noble friend <e> <s> first when article of the treaty refers to a uniform procedure in all member states of which he has spoken is that not clearly intended to mean also a uniform system <e> <s> secondly is my noble friend aware that the procedure committee of the european parliament which has been sitting for a good many months is now not likely to report its views on what system they recommend or what the options are until towards the end of the year <e> <s> is there not a risk therefore that as in and both houses of parliament will be rushed off their feet and not given a fair opportunity to express their views and for those views to be taken into account by the government <e>", "<cs> nevertheless my lords will my noble friend kindly bear in mind that apart from greenland this <e>", "<cs> my lords does not my noble friend agree that the harder it is to find the road the more important it is to have signposts and that there are practically none between london and gatwick <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for that reply <e> <s> is my noble <e>", "<cs> my lords in making their assumptions did her majestys government take the view that our competitive edge is blunted as much by outmoded restrictive practices and failures to meet delivery times as by the high pound and rising wage costs <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the foreign secretarys call yesterday for increased co-ordination of effort in the west and for a better follow-through to consultation that at present takes place in too many forums is very welcome <e> <s> while it may be argued that the west is not in disarray have we not recently given a rather good imitation of it <e> <s> does that not mean that many people will now ask where do we go from here and who is going to take the long overdue initiative to improve political co-operation among the democracies <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there is considerable evidence that most of the soviet satellite countries of europe would greatly prefer to enter into bilateral agreements with community countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for that full and helpful reply which seems to show that while what has so far been promised is still less than adequate much more progress has been made than might appear <e> <s> none the less may i ask my noble friend whether he does not feel that the failure of america to measure up fully to the generous promises that they made in and the dilatory way in which the european community has considered the application of zimbabwe to join the lom convention seem to show a lack of urgency on their part and a failure to appreciate that what was in a very compelling case for a development fund is an even more compelling one now <e>", "<cs> my lords may i return for a brief moment to the lom convention and ask my noble friend whether the commission now has a clear negotiating mandate which will enable it to take a sympathetic view of zimbabwes very considerable need to export beef tobacco and sugar <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i press my noble friend to add to that somewhat negative reply by asking him first whether he can confirm that m gaston thorn on his return from his fact-finding mission in the middle east <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not undeniable that the european community has at least as great a moral obligation and at least as many vested interests in seeking a workable and peaceful solution to the problems of the middle east as has the united states <e> <s> why should we hang back in trying to further this initiative bearing in mind in particular that president sadat has said that he would welcome a european initiative in parallel with the camp david one <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that these are impressive figures by any standard not-withstanding the rather disappointing figures for the first half of which appear to be rather against the trend <e> <s> however should not much more be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for that summary of a very complicated agreement in regard to which i feel the government deserve much praise for the skill and patience that they have shown in negotiating it <e> <s> may i put two brief supplementary questions to my noble friend <e> <s> first does he agree with me that had a socialist britain not been a member of the community new zealands and australias traditional export markets would have been at risk from dumping of subsidised frozen lamb and butter from the intervention stockpiles and that therefore it is just as well that we are members of the community <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> while being the first to agree that interference in the domestic affairs of the formerly independent countries of eastern and central europe is to be deplored is it not none the less a mistake to underestimate the influence of the democracies in trying to bring forward the happy day when a greater measure of national independence can be enjoyed with which one hopes more personal freedom and more democratic institutions would march <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful indeed for that encouraging reply <e> <s> my noble friend knows that his initiative towards this end which believe it or not was agreed in principle in the community some years ago but which made no progress is widely welcome <e> <s> is not the creation of the european community indeed a turning point in the history of our continent in that it has given all member countries a new weight in the world words which noble lords will immediately recognise and while it is logical for marxists to take the opposite point of view do not conservatives who wish us to withdraw from the community and take the opposite point of view make themselves look totally out of touch with reality <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to talk about the serious dangers that we should run if the country were to disarm unilaterally on a substantial scale as is now it seems advocated by the labour party and to pick up some of the admirable and interesting points so well made by the noble lord lord chalfont <e> <s> i also want to look at this matter in the context of growing threats to the non-communist world and what i see as our inadequate response to many of them <e> <s> i pick up here perhaps one or two points made by my noble friend lord gisborough in a very well researched speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not really want to get into this sort of hassle <e> <s> i did not wish to be unduly controversial <e> <s> it was the fault of the conservative government <e> <s> none the less i remember my father who was a member of parliament at the time reminding me many times how often the labour party had voted against the service estimates and what a pathetic belief they had in paper collective security <e> <s> we were all to blame <e> <s> mr bevin was right <e> <s> i am not trying to score a party point at all <e> <s> the main blame must rest on the government of the day and that was a conservative government that is who i was criticising when i made those remarks and when the noble lord interrupted <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that reply <e> <s> may i ask my noble friend whether he agrees that the prevarication and delay which have dogged this draft directive for direct insurance services other than life assurance really do fly in the face of the spirit and the letter of the treaties <e> <s> is he still reasonably confident that his prediction on th october that it would be months and not years it has been seven years already before this directive is agreed is still valid and should the estimate prove to be overoptimistic would not the only thing be for us to appeal to the court <e>", "<cs> my lords do her majestys government have any views about the export of <e>", "<cs> my lords as one of the very few noble lords who have made two maiden speeches in this chamber may i congratulate both my noble friends on two outstanding maiden speeches <e> <s> they were a treat to listen to they were very well-informed in content and skilfully presented <e> <s> i am sure that all noble lords enjoyed them enormously <e> <s> the conservation movement greatly welcomes the governments initiative in introducing this bill which i think is a good one and which i hope will be an excellent one by the time it has been through both houses <e> <s> i must apologise incidentally for the fact for the first time that i shall not be able to stay throughout the debate for inescapable reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with my noble friend <e> <s> speaking for myself i would not object to having a statutory requirement that there must be consultation with the owners <e> <s> nor do i believe that anybody else could seriously object <e> <s> incidentally the nature conservancy council i think are going to publish a summary of the scientific criteria on which they base the selection of these sites <e> <s> that is something also of considerable interest to owners and many other people as well <e> <s> i was saying that these sites will not get the protection that they need unless the bill is amended to take account for the need of advance notification of any potentially damaging activity to any sssi <e>", "<cs> now that my noble friend lord sandys has heard the anxieties expressed on both sides of the committee which i think are clearly fairly widely shared perhaps he will be good enough to say that he will at any rate look at this again even though he is prejudiced against the amendment at the moment <e> <s> i fully realise this is a very prickly and very complicated question <e> <s> it would have been tackled in and under the wild birds protection acts had it been easier to tackle <e> <s> the noble lord lord donaldson the immediate past president of the royal society for the protection for birds of which i was once president is only too well aware how anxious the rspb is that it should be tackled <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendments <e>", "<cs> they are rather connected <e> <s> some of the amendments are consequential a bird comes off one schedule and goes into another <e> <s> i think it is the easiest way <e>", "<cs> with permission they are amendments nos <e> <s> which is jointly with the noble lord lord kilbracken and nos <e> <s> and all of which affect schedules or and five species of birds <e> <s> by way of introduction i should like to tell the committee that during the passage of the wild bird protection acts of and with both of which i was closely concerned i felt that it would be a mistake to try to force upon the government the opinions of parliament about individual species of birds bearing in mind that the government have the advice of highly expert committees in the shape of the birds advisory committees which are representative of sporting interests conservation interests scientific interests farming interests and so on <e> <s> i must say that over the years their advice has been on the whole very good but i think it right that they should take some real account of the views expressed by your lordships <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to my noble friend lord avon for the sympathetic way in which he has responded to this debate on the different species contained in the schedules <e> <s> i feel very strongly indeed that whether the redshank the curlew the bar-tailed godwit are common rare easy or hard to identify or easy to mix up with other birds or not so easy to mix up or whether they are good to eat or nasty to eat does not make very much difference to the principle which i am suggesting that shooting shore waders is an historic accident <e> <s> i think they are the only three the golden plover not being a shore bird which are still left on the huntable list <e> <s> this has just happened and been taken for granted <e> <s> it would be far tidier in every way and would mean that wildfowlers would lose nothing worth while if they were all protected <e> <s> the scaup and the goldeneye are different matters <e> <s> the case for the scaup is very strong and my noble friend accepted it <e> <s> the case for the goldeneye is perhaps equally strong <e>", "<cs> when we were debating the act it was suggested on both sides of the house very strongly that unless there were some restriction on the ports of entry through which rare species of animals or plants could come into this country or for that matter go out be exported the problem facing the customs official would he an impossible one and that as a result rare animals and rare plants that are not supposed to be imported or parts of them after they are dead would find their way into this country <e> <s> that indeed is what is happening <e> <s> there was very strong pressure on the government at the time but it was resisted and the bill was not suitably amended <e>", "<cs> i hope i may detain your lordships for a few minutes on this very important amendment perhaps one of the two or three most important amendments in the whole of this bill <e> <s> i find it extremely disappointing and also surprising that there is no provision in the bill for the setting up of marine nature reserves <e> <s> the government have had a great deal of time to consider this <e> <s> we are talking about a subject which has been of great concern to conservationists to my knowledge for at least years which covers seven or eight governments <e> <s> the then nature conservancy as it was called first raised the question of setting up marine nature reserves in march long before the noble lord lord melchett mentioned in a paper called <e>", "<cs> i was not listening as well as i should have been <e>", "<cs> so far as these two amendments are concerned i greatly appreciate what my noble friend has said and i naturally withdraw the amendment that i have moved <e>", "<cs> first may i say a brief word about the lapwing <e> <s> i remember that in and we had endless discussions about the taking of lapwings eggs <e> <s> that has not arisen yet but obviously the taking of their eggs would be covered by the amendment and i would be grateful if the minister could comment on this later in the bill <e> <s> as i understand it under the act is was possible to take lapwings eggs before th april in any year and to sell them but under the act it was made illegal to take the eggs of this species before th april and the sale of the eggs was also forbidden <e>", "<cs> as some noble lords know i am a member of the ncc <e> <s> i am not their spokesman but naturally my views on this particular subject reflect theirs as we have discussed this matter at some length <e> <s> may i for two or three minutes put on the record what generally speaking they feel about it or at any rate what i feel about it <e> <s> i feel that the <e>", "<cs> i am not at all happy about these amendments <e> <s> certainly i think they are well meant and i understand the reasoning behind them but i think they are mistaken and should be resisted <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say what contribution the soviet union makes to this fund <e>", "<cs> if i may intervene the noble earl has been extremely patient with the committee but on this subject he will remember that at second reading i raised the question of the conditional exemption from capital transfer tax <e> <s> does it not go a little further than that and is this not another advantage of which owners of sssis ought to be made aware <e> <s> are there not certain capital gains tax benefits also associated with this conditional exemption under section of the finance act <e> <s> if that is the case which i believe it is may i ask my noble friend whether the treasury will look at this question of the <e>", "<cs> i strongly support all three points of view that have been put forward <e> <s> i had a self-denying ordinance during this debate <e> <s> there was a lot i should have liked to say on this clause but the reason i did not say it was because it was all said for me and better than i could have said it <e> <s> i am disappointed at the attitude of the government here <e> <s> i still feel that all self-financed operations in all sssis that are potentially damaging should be subject to advance notice to the nature conservancy council just as those that attract capital grants have been since last summer <e> <s> the government set the principle last summer in a comparatively small way but they at least admitted that there was merit in it <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord replies perhaps i might intervene in case it is helpful <e> <s> as i have said on a number of occasions i cannot of course speak for the nature conservancy council <e> <s> i am simply an undistinguished and rather junior member of it but i would certainly argue the case for these amendments in council and i should be very surprised indeed if i did not carry them with me <e>", "<cs> i believe the proposed new clause is based on a complete misunderstanding and that the procedure it suggests is very cumbersome <e> <s> the classification of an area of land as an sssi is a statement of scientific fact <e> <s> an avocet is an avocet a natterjack toad is a natterjack toad and a marsh gentian is a marsh gentian and there is no arguing about that <e> <s> the classification of an area as an sssi does not so far as i know inhibit or affect in any way existing farming or forestry operations that are being undertaken <e> <s> it does not blight the area in any way <e> <s> surely an appeal is appropriate only if and when a designation order is placed on a site because of failure to reach a voluntary agreement and a voluntary agreement is what everybody wants to achieve <e> <s> the rather timid approach in clause of the bill will mean that designation orders i hope there may be second thoughts about this are likely to be placed in only a very small number of cases between and per cent <e> <s> of all the biological sites <e>", "<cs> i should like to add my thanks <e> <s> i had amendments down which would have had the same effect <e> <s> i am extremely grateful for the action which the government have taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i confess that i am very disappointed with my noble friends reply <e> <s> he told us that the england and wales committees though not <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment about terms on which licences are granted gives me an opportunity to put a question to my noble friend to clear up any doubts there may be about a minor point of some interest that is swan upping <e> <s> as i understand it swan upping is a process of catching young birds and marking them by notching their beaks <e> <s> swans upped on the thames are wild protected birds which normally could not be taken legally for upping or any other purpose <e> <s> in the normal way a licence would have to be issued under clause <e> <s> this is a unique situation and both the dyers company and the vintners company are anxious that there should be no doubts about how they are placed under the amended law <e> <s> is it correct that because of the crown royalty the dyers and vintners companies can continue their traditional swan upping activities without clause licences and without let or hindrance <e> <s> this is my understanding based on a letter from mr hector monro to the chairman of the ncc <e> <s> i know my noble friend does not often up swans but i hope he will confirm that what i have said is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend replies it would be only right that someone on this side of the house also should tell him how very much we appreciate the skill patience and understanding with which he has handled this bill throughout this very long day <e> <s> we are very grateful indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcomed the second reading and now i welcome the third reading even more and i join the tributes that have been paid to both front benches <e> <s> i recall my noble friend lord avon complaining at one point that he was being sniped at from behind as well as in front and that was true at one stage <e> <s> however he came through it unscathed and smiling <e> <s> likewise the opposition front bench has been as well informed as it has been constructive <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for that informative reply <e> <s> naturally <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords since the venice declaration states so clearly the palestinian peoples undoubted and undeniable rights should not there <e>", "<cs> i take it that we are able to say a few words about all these amendments together in the light of the question that was asked by my noble friend lord mansfield <e> <s> i shall be brief <e> <s> i should like to support everything that has been said so far <e> <s> i feel very strongly indeed about this question <e> <s> ten years ago we could put our hands on our hearts and say that this country was in the lead where the treatment of disabled people was concerned and the law had been improved by the act <e> <s>

america canada italy and west germany <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for that reply <e> <s> can my noble friend give an estimate of the cost of the programme in the coming financial year <e> <s> can he say anything about what is known as the placing rate in other words how many of those who go through the courses go into full-time work or into further training or further education <e> <s> may i ask another brief question <e> <s> can he say whether the manpower services commissions report entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware of the widespread concern that is being expressed by many people who do not wish to see the gleneagles agreement amended and who see the sense of it about the so-called blacklisting of individual sportsmen which would surely be likely to harm rather than help the progress towards multiracial sport in south africa <e> <s> arising out of that is he aware that encouraging progress is being made <e> <s> association football for example is a sport which is now largely non-racial <e> <s> should we not encourage that in every possible way <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that i was not in my supplementary question thinking about the united nations which did not really enter into it <e> <s> i was thinking about a private organisation known as sanroc which has published a list of individuals who have played games in south africa and have sought to blacklist them from playing games in other countries <e> <s> is that not something quite beyond the gleneagles agreement of which we should strongly disapprove in that it is contrary to personal freedom <e>", "<cs> my lords while the wheelchair symbol is internationally recognised does not my noble friend agree that full account must also be taken of the problems of those who have great difficulty in walking or climbing steps with or without sticks or crutches <e> <s> sometimes their problems are even greater than the problems of those who are confined to wheelchairs <e> <s> can attention please also be drawn to this problem during access week <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to my noble friend for what she has said <e> <s> it was not my intention at any time to press amendment no <e> <s> which is the only one that i have so far moved <e> <s> i have not yet moved amendment no <e> <s> or amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it was not my intention even to think of pressing amendment no <e> <s> to a division <e> <s> however i wanted to draw attention to the fact that there is a great deal of carelessness and thoughtlessness on the part of drivers who are not disabled in the way in which they park in spaces which are specially reserved for disabled people <e>", "<cs> i am very pleased indeed as i am sure the whole committee is with my noble friends reply <e> <s> it seems to imply quite clearly that the maximum fine for this particular offence in other words an able-bodied person parking his car in a bay specially reserved for disabled people will in fact rise to which is a lot better than becausethis is a serious offence and the punishment should fit the crime <e> <s> there is nothing between and in the four-point scale of summary fines introduced by the criminal law act of to which my noble friend has referred <e> <s> so on the assumption that i am right in saying that it only remains for me to ask my noble friend to be good enough to indicate whether this is to be left to the home office for what might be quite a long time and <e>", "<cs> with great pleasure <e> <s> i should be very appreciative indeed if my noble friend would be good enough to let me know what figure the government have in mind and what timing they have in mind and assuming that that is in essence what she has just said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as i was involved in the arguments about this particular question in a small way i too should like to take this opportunity to say how greatly i welcome the governments change of heart and mind which was announced by my noble friend lord mansfield on nd june during the passage of the local government miscellaneous provisions scotland bill <e> <s> i do not want to waste the committees time for one moment but i must just look back to when the chronically sick and disabled persons bill was going through both houses and when the government of the day flatly refused to consider doing just what we are doing now and indeed when successive governments of both parties equally flatly refused to do any <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name of the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that if my mental arithmetic is working his reply means that three whole years after this admirable project was first introduced about a dozen government office buildings will still not have been modified <e> <s> therefore is not progress quite excessively slow and is there not a clear case for speeding this up and trying to complete this project excellent as it is in this international year of disabled people <e> <s> finally can my noble friend give noble lords an assurance that the original sum set aside for this project will be sufficient without having to be topped up <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much appreciate that reply <e> <s> my noble friend has made it clear on a number of occasions that he would welcome conditional recognition by the palestine liberation organisation of israels rights which were clearly restated in the venice declaration <e> <s> going on from that does my noble friend share the view that it would be a great deal easier for the plo to recognise israels rights if they were confident that the reaction in america would be to say that they in turn recognised that the palestinian people have the same rights of self-determination and of security as the israeli people have <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that many of us are still mystified as to the connection

the right to have their own home in their own country at least up to the pre- armistice lines <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend in his first reply to my noble friend lord renton said that district councils are required to do certain things in these very important fields <e> <s> is it then a statutory obligation on them to do so and if not should it not be in view of the great importance that

has to bring the code of guidance to the attention of some owners and occupiers of sssis but also to bring to their attention on our instructions the scientific value of the areas they occupy and the damage that could easily be caused unwittingly <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i am right in saying that this debate does not finish until pm <e> <s> if i am right in so saying it occurs to me that the

giving the vote to some british subjects living in other community countries <e> <s> if the government are in favour why on earth should we wait for the council of ministers to make up their mind something which they are not at all good at doing and about which they are most unlikely to be unanimous rather than following in the footsteps of seven out of nine of the other community countries

to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that if the communitys high-sounding protests are to be taken really seriously they must

what the noble lord lord trefgarne has said that he will look at this between now and report stage <e> <s> i do not want to duplicate anything that has been said but i want to draw the attention of the committee to the fact that from the nature conservation point of view this is a very serious problem indeed with something between one-third and one-half of the straw and stubble in this country

question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is it correct to say that there was a surprising consensus of view among the thoroughly representative consumer and trade organisations and the local authority associations consulted and that only two out of that had any reservations at all <e> <s> did they not also conclude that the time is now ripe for legislation in this field in a country which last year consumed million gallons of wine and that legislation should be introduced on the same broad lines as already exists thoroughly successfully in for example

party between the united states and european community to try to narrow still further the differences that still exist on both sides of the atlantic and perhaps prepare the way for a reconvened geneva conference <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friends first answer mean that the government share the growing concern of many owners of large and small woodlands who have the utmost difficulty selling timber at any price at all for pulping so that some of them have to give it away only to see it going to scandinavia to be brought back again as pulp <e> <s> is that not quite mad <e>", "<cs> my lords

disappointment to the council and its staff and to many people outside who share our admiration for the able and thorough way in which he has carried out his duties which are difficult very time-consuming far from easy and sometimes rather thankless <e> <s> may i ask my noble friend whether or not sir ralph will be rather a difficult chairman to follow <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the

barriers by exploiting fresh markets <e> <s> is my noble friend able to help the house including the labour party by saying where those markets are and why they are not being exploited now <e>", "<cs>

anyone that they simply cannot agree about what to do next <e> <s> it may even in the end destroy any real prospect of palestinian self-determination <e> <s> does not the taking of decisions by consensus give a veto to an extreme and unrepresentative minority <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend

important amendments made would my noble friend at any rate give me an assurance that the government will give thought to providing government time for this bill or even taking the bill over <e>",

ask my noble friend whether he does not feel that the export of the marxist-leninist system to the formerly independent countries of east and central europe has had the dual effect first of denying them the self-determination to which they are entitled and which they were promised at yalta secondly and equally important of failing to give the soviet union the security on their western frontier

what is known as the three months loophole is blocked <e> <s> that is something which both government and opposition wish to see done <e> <s> is it not unfortunate that in another place a private members bill which i understand is not yet printed but the contents of which nonetheless have been broadcast includes this amendment but also three others at least one of which is highly controversial <e> <s> is there not therefore in these circumstances a serious risk that the amendment which everybody wants is likely to fall by the wayside <e>", "<cs> my lords have not some of the criticisms of her majestys government been premature and greatly exaggerated <e> <s> do not the two letters in <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not beyond doubt that resolution of the security council which the united states proposed which was unanimous and which is mandatory requires israels withdrawal from the whole of south lebanon and also requires the united nations through unifil to give every assistance that it can to the lebanese government to restore its own effective authority <e> <s> is that not what the lebanese government wish to achieve and is it not understandable that they are nervous about an israeli withdrawal only taking part so far as stage one is concerned leaving the united nations in a buffer zone which separates two halves of the lebanon <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put a very brief question to my noble friend about the middle east <e> <s> while it was encouraging to hear that the time is considered propitious for a fresh initiative to try to solve the long-running almost years arab-israel dispute is it not very worrying that there is such a wide gap between american thinking on the basic principles on which any peaceful settlement has to be based and our own supported by all our european community partners and indeed by king hussein whom my noble friend mentioned <e> <s> can he possibly say whether any progress was made in persuading the united states government and in particular the white house that our thinking is correct and that theirs is fundamentally wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord fraser of kilmorack has made a very interesting <e>", "<cs> before the question is put perhaps i may make a brief remark <e> <s> it seems to me to be a great pity that the original intention of my noble friend lord newall to allow inter-track pools and multi-venue pools as they have come to be known has had to be dropped <e> <s> this matter was discussed over quite an extended period of time with the home office and at one stage some of us were quite optimistic that it had quite good prospects <e> <s> however that was not to be <e> <s> this is not the time to discuss this matter in detail because it is something that must be dropped <e> <s> i think we are fairly sure to say that we are not content with this clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware of the view that britains abstention has done something unfortunate that it has damaged our reputation as a trusted peace-broker in the arab-israeli dispute particularly in moderate arab eyes <e> <s> in particular i should like to ask how we are meant to square our outright and immediate condemnation of the shocking offence in south africa a couple of weeks ago with our failure to condemn a similar instance on the same sort of scale that has occurred in lebanese territory as a direct result of the declared policies of israel <e> <s> is there one rule for south africa at home and another for israel abroad <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is this not the first time that the foreign secretary of a nato country has drawn such clear and sharp distinctions between the governments of the formerly independent countries of east and central europe and their peoples <e> <s> have not <e>", "<cs> do i gather the suggestion is that we should return to this subject on tuesday in which case it would fall to me would it not to move amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> in that case i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e>", "<cs> i am very much encouraged by the intervention of my noble friend lord elton <e> <s> what he said was extremely helpful and i am grateful to him for his intervention in our discussion <e> <s> we have had a good debate <e> <s> i cannot help feeling that what the noble lord lord skelmersdale said was rather vague to put it no higher <e> <s> it was not very positive <e> <s> it showed the government have an open mind on this question and we all welcome that but surely we need ecological advice and advice on nature conservation to be part of the planning process which it really is at present <e> <s> the mere collation of data under clause is not the same as giving advice for planning and no one can say that it is <e> <s> we need to be sure too that the cost-effective teams continue <e> <s> they are multi-disciplinary <e> <s> it is true that some of the boroughs and districts have done excellent work in this sphere and will continue so to do but it is equally true that some are not interested and that others who will be under severe financial stringency simply will not be able to afford to do it in a cost-effective way <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great interest to what my noble friend has had to say <e> <s> i should like to thank all noble lords who have spoken in favour of these amendments and also those who have spoken against them <e> <s> i cannot say that i was very impressed by those who argued that these amendments did not come within the short title of the bill <e> <s> they are quite clearly i think consistent with the principles of the bill which are for maximum devolution to the boroughs <e> <s> the time is very late and there is obviously not a meeting of minds which i much regret <e> <s> i think therefore in the circumstances the right thing to do is to divide the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> good my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a good debate <e> <s> it has certainly been a very well-informed one and naturally i wish to thank all noble lords and the right reverend prelate for being good enough to take part in it <e> <s> i do not think it is very often that in a short debate noble lords from the conservative labour social democrat and liberal benches the cross-benches and the bishops benches all take part but that is what has happened today and there has on the whole been a remarkable consensus of view which i have found very encouraging <e>", "<cs> my lords since average figures are so often misleading are there any other conclusions <e>", "<cs> my lords as i moved the main amendments on the subject of urban nature conservation on the nd may and the debate was concluded on th may prehaps i may add a few words <e> <s> i am very grateful to noble lords in all parts of the house who supported those amendments on that occasion <e> <s> we seemed to be pretty unanimous about them <e> <s> the reason they had to be put down was there was no provision made in the bill for the continuation of urban nature conservation by the districts and boroughs after abolition of the glc and the metropolitan counties <e> <s> the burden of our argument on that occasion when these amendments were <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down he made a very important point and i am sure that he carried the house with him <e> <s> does he not feel that to wait until as i understood him to say the whole social security system has been reviewed and revised would mean he would have to wait for a very long time <e> <s> ought this not to be dealt with very quickly <e>", "<cs> it is only because my name is on the amendment that i might be allowed a few minutes briefly to address the committee <e> <s> i should like to say to my noble friend that so far as i am concerned as a late signatory to the amendment i thought that the undertaking he gave was helpful and forthcoming and in some contrast may i say with a rather more dismissive attitude taken to this amendment when it was moved in the same words in another place <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down may i ask very briefly whether he is aware that amendment no <e> <s> does not deal with existing pensioners or has he not noticed that <e> <s> he has put his name to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does not that reply speak for itself <e> <s> as my noble friend no doubt knows some members of the national union of mineworkers are due to go in the autumn to the soviet union for what is described as ideological tuition under the auspices of the higher trade union school of moscow <e> <s> may i ask my noble friend whether if the british ambassador were asked he would use his good offices to facilitate visits by these people to the gulags and psychiatric hospitals where these unhappy people are incarcerated and perhaps even visits to mr klebanov and mr volkov whose only crimes appear to have been to try to establish elementary trades union rights <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a little odd that no definite amendments have yet been put forward <e> <s> may i ask my noble friend whether the government have any time-scale in mind were amendments to be put forward bearing in mind that governments would have to approve them and that parliaments would have to endorse them <e> <s> secondly may i ask my noble friend whether she can say if the government think it might be necessary to amend the treaty in order to move more towards majority voting for which the treaties already make substantial provision <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that she would find it very difficult indeed to find any noble lords certainly not more than a tiny number on this side of the house who share the views of the noble lord lord jenkins on this matter <e>", "<cs> may i speak for just seconds <e> <s> in committee i put my name to the amendment of my noble friend lord gridley because i had some serious anxieties but i should like to take this opportunity of telling my noble friend the minister that i enormously appreciate the trouble that has been taken <e> <s> during the recess i wrote expressing anxieties similar to those that i outlined during the debate and i was one of the recipients of the letter dated th october to which my noble friend referred <e> <s> it is no bad thing that i should put on record one of the sentences in that letter although it will be made available for other noble lords to see <e> <s> my noble friend lord belstead said <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government given up any idea of raising the limit to mph <e> <s> i do hope so <e>", "<cs> my lords while this is a question perhaps of least said soonest mended is my noble friend aware that my noble friend lord cork and orrery is indeed reflecting the views of a very large number of people who were involved in one way or another in the war in the far east and whose feelings were very much hurt by what seemed at the time to be a very insensitive decision by the government <e> <s> is my noble friend nonetheless aware that the presence at the very moving ceremonies at the cemeteries in singapore and rangoon of his royal highness the duke of kent and of the secretary of state for defence himself have done something to assuage those feelings <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend agree that the environmental impact of a fixed link is bound to be very far-reaching indeed and of course permanent <e> <s> is he aware of the widely held view that the amount of time that has been allowed to consider this impact is wholly inadequate <e>", "<cs> a very strong case has been made for the principle contained in these amendments <e> <s> it is well known to the committee that the balance between netsmen and rodsmen has been very heavily weighted in favour of the former for a long time perhaps for all time <e> <s> netting in drought conditions and very low water is surely from a conservation point of view a self-defeating exercise bearing in mind the awful hazards the salmon has to run both on the high seas and in trying to get up the rivers <e> <s> it of course results in quite a substantial reduction in the breeding stock of the salmon <e>", "<cs> may i say to my noble friend in the most friendly way possible that he refers to the salmon in the naver which i know so well as being his fish <e> <s> are they not our fish <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the manufacture and sale of split lead shots the real yardstick by which to measure what progress is being made and can my noble friend say whether the trade is co-operating here <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house is most grateful to the noble viscount lord thurso for having raised this matter this evening <e> <s> it was on rd july last year that my noble friend lord ridley who as noble lords know is president of the territorial army association raised this question during a debate on the defence estimates <e> <s> i saw lord ridley last week and he told me how very much he regrets his inability to be here today <e> <s> i am apologising on his behalf <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put one very brief point to my noble friend <e> <s> is she able to update the figure which was last given about months ago of what would be the cost to the taxpayer <e> <s> with total disregard for territorial volunteers it was million at june i think <e> <s> if my noble friend cannot tell me now could she write to me about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be extremely brief <e> <s> my noble friend has made an excellent case for this new clause and i think noble lords will agree that the suggestion is a modest one <e> <s> i think it will also be agreed that of all the hazards that the atlantic salmon has to run the only one for which there is absolutely no escape is netting in rivers or estuaries in low water <e> <s> they may be lucky not to get disease they may be lucky when they are on the high seas they may be lucky when they are swimming around the coasts and crofters are trying to pick up a few fish for the pot they are almost certain to be lucky when i am using a fly <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while not finding that answer particularly convincing may i in general terms ask my noble friend whether he does not agree that when speaking to a security council resolution and having reservations and thinking perhaps of abstaining it really is of the utmost importance that this should be made clear in the opening speech and that if this is not done then should there be a change of mind during the course of the debate an explanation of our vote should be given <e> <s> is there not a serious risk of a misunderstanding of what british policy really is unless this is done <e>", "<cs> my lords in more specific terms has not unifil been put in a dangerous and difficult if not near impossible position by the united states veto of this resolution which referred back to previous resolutions about the setting up of unifil and by the continued occupation of a large part of the lebanon by israels forces more than nine months after mr peres promised their complete withdrawal <e>", "<cs> my lords how does one reconcile what one hopes is a genuine desire on the part of mr gorbachev to restart negotiations with the way in which he turned down out of hand at a few days notice what seemed like an extremely important offer from president reagan to share the latest american know-how on verification which is surely the key to this question <e>", "<cs> my lords how confident can we be that british aid for tanzania to which i am in no way opposed actually reaches the targets for which it is intended <e> <s> have there not been great difficulties over that question in the past and can we have some reassurance on it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord st john of bletso has i believe started the debate on a very constructive note with a balanced and very well-informed speech <e> <s> i should like to thank him for it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certainly grateful for that answer but it does not get us very far <e> <s> will my noble friend confirm that article of regulation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government take full advantage of our presidency of the european council to try to breathe some badly needed new life into the venice declaration which we inspired during an earlier presidency <e> <s> at the same time may i ask my noble friend whether she is aware of the point of view that the west seems to have been less than even handed in demanding major concessions from the plo in advance of international negotiations while making no such demands of israel <e>", "<cs> my lords with the law broken on such a widespread national scale are prosecutions just left to chance or are there some guidelines <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put one point <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that more than countries including ec countries recognise the plo as the sole legal representative of the palestinian people <e> <s> one really cannot condemn all the members of the plo as terrorists <e> <s> that is quite ridiculous <e>", "<cs> where else have they got to go <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while unifil and unwra have done their best under near impossible conditions may i ask my noble friend whether she can confirm that some palestinian refugees are in the camps <e> <s> is not that figure probably an underestimate <e> <s> secondly does my noble friend share the quite widely held view that there is a serious risk that the beirut camps might be beseiged again <e> <s> to try to reduce this risk and dissuade israel from terror raids on ein hilwe which has helpless occupants will the government co-operate with the european community in raising these questions in the security council <e>", "<cs> my lords as the question of the recognition of israel by arafat has been raised though that was not the object of my question would it not help a good deal if the israeli government ceased to look with total disdain on binding security council resolutions requiring their withdrawal from the occupied territories <e>", "<cs> my lords i had almost forgotten that this was question time <e> <s> i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a serious anomaly that the longest retired who are often the most needy have the smallest pensions or for example that all our major nato allies treat their armed forces widows more generously than we do with pensions unrestricted either by the date of marriage or the date of their husbands retirement <e> <s> are not these powerful arguments for a full review <e> <s> will the government consider such a review <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government willing to look at the worst of these anomalies and thus make a start in the right direction <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very disappointing reply <e> <s> is it not a fact that this question has dragged on in the department since about when all that is required is an amendment to the weights and measures act <e> <s> why should a pint of beer a tot of spirits or a carafe of wine be strictly controlled by statute when no one knows what he is going to get in a glass of wine <e> <s> what is the reason for this straightforward and long-overdue measure not being introduced when the voluntary code has clearly failed and the sale of wine by the glass has become a widespread swindle <e>", "<cs> my lords in spite of what my noble friend says is he aware that the lack of progress has been very disappointing indeed and far less than any of us anticipated when the wildlife and countryside bill was going through this house <e> <s> is he further aware that that does not result from any lack of enthusiasm or energy on the part of the nature conservancy council and what he has said about trying to find a shorter means to the same end is welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask my noble friend a question about the communitys birds directive british compliance with which as one would expect is excellent <e> <s> is he aware that the directive is almost totally ignored in france spain italy greece and in other parts of the world and that birds are killed by the million involving methods of the utmost cruelty <e> <s> will my noble friend do his utmost to try to persuade our community partners to comply with the law <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be right for me to declare an interest in this matter in so far as i own about acres of woodland in sussex which caught the full blast of the hurricane <e> <s> may i thank my noble friend very much indeed for that somewhat reassuring reply <e> <s> if the governments view proves over-optimistic about the disposal of fallen timber and the market is unable to absorb it will my noble friend at any rate say that they will not rule out the suggestion made in the last two lines of my question <e> <s> may i also ask my noble friend whether there is further action which the government are contemplating <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government had wise second thoughts about regulating the quantity of wine that one gets when one asks for a glass of wine in a pub <e> <s> is not the consumer entitled to the same protection where wine is concerned as he is where beer cider and spirits are concerned <e> <s> cannot a regulation be issued under section and be included in the code of practice <e>", "<cs> my lords since soviet foreign policy has not departed in a single respect from the brezhnev doctrine where the former independent countries of eastern and central europe and the baltic states are concerned or in other continents does not this emphasise very heavily indeed the importance of weu <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the governments failure to licence salmon dealers has opened up so many different ways in which poachers can get rid of wild salmon that the chances of inspecting them for signs of disease are absolutely nil <e>", "<cs> my lords while i find my noble friends reply very discouraging nevertheless perhaps i may take this opportunity through him of thanking the government for the very sympathetic way in which they have listened to representations made to them by the british legion the war widows of great britain and the officers pensions society <e>", "<cs>

killed which resulted from it <e> <s> i shall not dwell on that aspect either <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate opened so well by the noble lord lord carter is very timely <e> <s> i should like to start by making three brief post-hurricane points <e> <s> first i understand that the government are carrying out a sample air survey to try to decide how many trees were lost <e> <s> the million
