["<cs> my lords it is with great humility that i crave the indulgence of the house in making my maiden speech here <e> <s> i will try to be as brief as possible but before i start to say what i intend to say i should like to congratulate my sister in distress the noble baroness lady airey of abingdon on her most delightful speech <e> <s> i agreed with every word she said and i hope in the future frequently to hear her speak again <e>", "<cs> my lords what price womens lib <e> <s> why should the women not smoke if the men can <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the government to consider one small social aspect of the weekly payment of pensions particularly to elderly pensioners living alone through village post offices <e> <s> most village postmasters and postmistresses are inveterate gossips and if old maggie smith has not been in to collect her pension one week they will notice and will gossip about it to the neighbours <e> <s> somebody will then go to see whether old maggie smith is all right <e> <s> this is a service which is of course combined with the postmans knock and the milkmans delivery which at present is being given at no extra cost to the government <e> <s> it seems to me that if any of these services were to be withdrawn the government would need to provide social workers to go and visit elderly people who are living alone every day or very regularly to make certain that they were all right <e> <s> this would be very expensive and very unwelcome because the elderly people would consider them to be government busybodies nosing into their own affairs and i hardly see that there would be very much saving <e>", "<cs> there is one kind of right which has not been mentioned so far what are called easements in england and wayleaves in scotland <e> <s> in the case of buildings or houses they are very necessary for obtaining water supply and electricity <e> <s> does the bill as it stands at present enable the trustees to buy these <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i would just like to say a word or two in support of clause i of this bill <e> <s> i agree with every word the noble lord lord drumalbyn said <e> <s> in fact he has said most of what i was going to say already but there are just two points which i should like to emphasise <e> <s> the first is that where a tenant purchases his council house the burden of maintaining it as i think has already been mentioned will fall upon him instead of upon the local authority as in the past <e> <s> i am a scot and i know that the scots are a canny race <e> <s> i do not think that many scots will contemplate purchasing their houses unless they are fully aware of the burdens which they are undertaking <e> <s> the second point is that the money which the local authorities obtain from the sale of council houses to sitting tenants can go to help towards the provision of further housing <e>", "<cs> i am a little worried about subsection of this clause <e> <s> as i understand it having checked section of the local government scotland act money received from the sale of council houses will go into the local <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not like this bill <e> <s> i am all for seat belts but i do not like the wearing of them to be made compulsory for several reasons <e> <s> first and most important i believe that it interferes with the freedom of an individual to assess the risk to himself and to make his own decisions <e> <s> we are not talking about preventing people injuring others as by drunken <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to give your lordships three examples of things that are bad in the present system and were very much better in some places before <e> <s> before the reorganisation of local government in scotland fraserburgh burgh council employed general labourers except where special skills were required <e> <s> those labourers all received the same rates of pay and were taken on on the understanding that they were prepared to work in any department <e> <s> thus we never had the situation where for example in severe weather in winter the gardeners were sitting twiddling their thumbs in the greenhouses while other people had to be employed on clearing the streets of snow and ice <e> <s> now everything is departmentalised and each department employs labourers for their purposes only so that if for any reason those labourers cannot do their job they are idle instead of getting on with a job for another department <e> <s> this either means employing far more labour at great extra expense to the ratepayers or having the work less well done or even sometimes not done at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to declare an interest in forestry as an owner of small woodlands <e> <s> i should like first to congratulate the noble lord lord sher-field and his committee on the very interesting farsighted and readable report which they have produced and to thank them for it <e> <s> i hope that the government will pay it the attention it deserves <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the right reverend prelate the bishop of durham for his understanding speech <e> <s> this bill causes me great concern for i fear that as it stands it will undermine the whole fabric of family life by creating an atmosphere of distrust between people and their in-laws which is by no means the norm despite the perennial old jokes about mothers-in-law <e> <s> if we may take just one example page line enables a man to marry his mother-in-law <e> <s> now take a hypothetical case an ambitious unscrupulous young man married to a wife who has a rich mother with a <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government aware that the present situation puts widows in a much worse position than working wives whose need is usually less great and that where they have children they are often forced on to social security which is humiliating to them and expensive to administer <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government keep the plight of widows in mind and review the situation as regularly as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with every word of the magnificent speeches which the noble earls lord selkirk and lord lauderdale have just made <e> <s> they have taken most of my words out of my mouth <e> <s> this bill was i believe originally conceived by the noble baroness lady wootton as a bill applying to england and wales only <e> <s> then on the suggestion of the noble lord lord belstead at second reading it has been amended to apply to scotland as well <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> applies only to new buildings <e>", "<cs> may i beg leave to say a few more words about amendment no <e> <s> and perhaps at the same time as this is a general discussion about amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> seeks to strengthen section of the chronically sick and disabled persons act as amended by the act in its application to scotland <e> <s> without those acts in front of one the position may not be easy to understand so i will offer a few words of explanation <e>", "<cs> the forestry world is very concerned about tpos because as the noble lord lord dulverton said local authorities are not expert foresters and quite often know little or nothing about trees <e> <s> if the recipient of a tpo can have recourse to the secretary of state he will take the advice of the forestry commission if he needs it and the forestry commission should be the ultimate forest authority because it really does know about trees <e>", "<cs> my lords there are several points i should like to mention regarding clause <e> <s> i spoke on this subject fairly fully only a few months ago when the bill introduced by the noble lord lord nugent had its second reading and i will try not to repeat what i said then <e> <s> but one thing i must repeat if you are going to make any wearing of seat belts compulsory you must ensure that the release mechanism is both very simple and identical for all cars registered in britain and this must be done before compulsion is introduced not after <e>", "<cs> i entirely and wholeheartedly support the amendment <e> <s> driving without insurance is one of the worst crimes that can be committed <e> <s> but for what the noble lord lord underhill had said i should have been very doubtful whether there could be mitigating circumstances in such cases <e> <s> i would not consider eight points in any way excessive and i shall certainly support the amendment <e> <s> i suggest that the imposition of eight points should be unarguable <e>", "<cs> in these days when almost all churches are locked because of vandalism i do not think that right of sanctuary would be very much use <e>", "<cs> it will come as no surprise to the noble lord lord nugent to hear that i am totally opposed to his amendment <e> <s> first as i have said before i deplore compulsion in regard to the wearing of seat belts because of the dangerous precedent it would set on interference with the freedom of the individual to assess the risk to himself and to decide whether or not to take it <e> <s> once you start this kind of thing there is no logical end to it and you are on a very slippery slope indeed <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to the noble lord lord bellwin for what he has said <e> <s> in the circumstances i should like to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord bear in mind the unfortunate housewife doing her shopping in the local town or village <e> <s> she is not delivering she is picking up because no one now will deliver <e>", "<cs> my lords i should just like to say a word or two in support of the amendment of the noble baroness lady macleod of borve <e> <s> first as regards the wearing of seat belts by pregnant women i personally have tried to wear a seat belt an intertia-reel seat belt when pregnant and it was extremely uncomfortable <e> <s> i can speak to that matter from personal experience <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to emphasise one point which the noble lord lord mottistone has made which is that the same car may be driven by a variety of different people and that a variety of different people may be passengers in that car in seats in which it is mandatory to wear seat belts <e> <s> therefore it is necessary to be able to have a variety of different fixings or adjustable seat belts <e>", "<cs> my lords i suggest we should have a flat rate fine of or which seems much more suitable to the offence or a maximum fine of because there still are people in this world to whom is relatively speaking peanuts <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord bellwin for the immense amount of time and trouble he has taken over this group of amendments which i feel sure will do a lot to ease the problems of young mothers <e> <s> this includes writing me a letter which the post office failed to deliver and talking to me on the telephone at some length <e>", "<cs> my lords while i welcome large portions of the bill in fact most of it i have like the noble baroness lady elliot of harwood some reservations about the clauses in part vi <e> <s> i hope i am wrong but clauses and appear to me to give local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope this house would agree that every law must be administered strictly in accordance with its provisions <e> <s> if those provisions are unacceptable because as i believe to be the case with the subsection that this bill seeks to repeal they are vindictive and because they seek to disqualify a person from membership of a professional body not on proof of his misconduct but on hearsay of someone elses then i fear that decent people will tend to disregard those provisions and so the law will not be enforced and unless i am very much mistaken the noble baroness lady birk has already suggested that this may be the case <e> <s> in that case the law will be in danger of coming into disrepute and that is something that this house has a special duty to guard against and something that we normally consider very carefully <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank my noble friend for that reply and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble earl for his helpful reply <e> <s> i am very glad to hear of his proposed rather farther reaching amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no kc as an amendment to amendment no <e> <s> kb <e>", "<cs> in view of the ministers undertaking to reconsider the matter and in the hope that he will consider removing the power to demolish i beg leave to withdraw the amendment to the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble earl for this amendment and i hope the noble lord lord howie of troon will be too <e> <s> i think it should lead in future to the preservation of a number of cowgates and to rather fewer riverside drives <e>", "<cs> my latin is very rusty and so is my roman history <e> <s> i know that the noble earl lord mansfield does not agree with me on this and has pointed out to me the latin origins of the word civic which meant a citizen <e> <s> but a citizen of what <e> <s> of a city or urbs either in rome or later of some other towns or cities but never was it used to refer to country-dwellers who were very much third-class persons without a vote not citizens of anywhere at all but merely country bumpkins whose only use was to grow food for the <e>", "<cs> my lords like so many of your lordships i have been waiting for a year for the noble baronesss debate and i am very glad that she has been lucky in the lucky dip at last <e> <s> i should like to say a few words about transport of people which will rather dovetail with what the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe has already said <e> <s> before the beeching axe started to chop there were few places in aberdeenshire and north-east scotland which were more than about seven miles from the railway because a network of railway lines spread north and west from aberdeen like the sticks of a fan <e>", "<cs> my lords i am thankful to say that i do not think there is very much demand for establishments of this kind in scotland <e> <s> but even if the demand for them was greater than it is i do not think that they should be permitted at all let alone licensed <e> <s> there is a demand a sma <e>", "<cs> my lords i am concerned about one kind of procession although i am not sure whether it would count as a procession <e> <s> i refer to a temperance walk <e> <s> could the noble earl keep that in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be happy to withdraw the amendment but i should be grateful if the noble earl could think about what i have suggested regarding a notice in the press <e> <s> i feel that the noble lord lord ross is right and that people do miss what goes on in the planning committee and very often do not get to know about it until it is too late <e> <s> a notice in the press would make that little bit of difference <e> <s> however i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords who have just spoken are perfectly right my amendment deals with street names and not numbers <e>", "<cs> i think it is time that somebody spoke again in support of the amendment and i should like to do so <e> <s> but i support it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted that the noble earl has been able to produce these two amendments instead of the very clumsy ones that i proposed last week <e> <s> i think and hope that this amendment will make local authorities realise that street names must be capable of being read by the public in the street not just by the sparrows on the housetops <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a word or two in support of the noble lord whose bill this is <e> <s> i cannot see why the noble lord lord glenkinglas is quite so worried about this point of night shooting <e> <s> in the first place nobody is suggesting that anyone would do it for sport <e> <s> it is entirely as a last resort for pest control <e> <s> and make no mistake <e> <s> in scotland both red deer and to a much greater extent in large parts of <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with others in congratulating the noble viscount lord buckmaster on an interesting and learned maiden speech <e> <s> i would wholeheartedly support his observation that right and wrong do not change with the times <e> <s> they are the same for ever <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just say one or two words about roe deer which have been mentioned in connection with this amendment <e> <s> roe deer are very widespread throughout the lowlands of scotland both in the north and in the south <e> <s> they are much more widespread than red deer and for preference they live in young woodlands <e> <s> they are far more prolific breeders than red deer and they have increased so dramatically in the past years that they now occupy very much the same position as a forest and agricultural pest that the rabbit had before myxomatosis <e> <s> no one ever suggested that the rabbit should not be shot at all times without the inconvenience of the person shooting requiring authority from the deer commission <e> <s> we all hope that people shooting roe deer will have suitable firearms for doing that and i think that the schedules which are proposed to be introduced by the secretary of state should help to cover this <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord not agree that the proposed new system of telephone messages which is to replace our present telegram system will not really be very much more help than a first-class letter would be if a first-class letter arrived when a first-class letter should <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government consider increasing attendance allowances and back-up services to enable old people to be kept more in their own homes rather than be sent to institutions <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for that answer and in view of it i do not think that i shall pursue the matter any further except to ask whether he will keep me informed of any decisions that are reached on the subject <e>", "<cs> i am not a university lecturer <e> <s> i am not a paid-up member even for one year of a trade union <e> <s> i am just an ordinary woman and as such i go about and talk to other ordinary people and listen to what they have to tell me <e> <s> i entirely agree with the noble lords lords spens and lord boardman that the public of this country are thoroughly fed up with endless strikes many of which are not wanted even by the majority of union members who dare not say so openly for fear of intimidation <e> <s> i therefore support the amendment which seeks merely to curb the power of undemocratically elected tyrants and not to be nasty to the poor dear trade unions and i hope the committee will support it <e>", "<cs> i too support the amendment <e> <s> it is long overdue and we need it now not next session or the one after in yet another employment bill <e> <s> this government have by their courage over other matters won greater support in the country than any other government since <e> <s> courage is a most attractive virtue and if they now have the courage to do what most people in the country want they will earn everyones admiration <e> <s> we have been at this cherry twice <e> <s> let us stop nibbling at it like mice and finish it off like men <e>", "<cs> will the noble and learned lord the lord advocate widen his explanation just a little to explain what happens to the motorist normally resident in scotland who has left his licence behind in scotland and who is then convicted in england of a fixed penalty endorsable offence who is not going to be back in scotland for a month to rootle out his licence and show it <e>", "<cs> yes i was <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord porritt said anyone fit to drive was fit to wear a seat belt <e> <s> i hope i have not misquoted him <e> <s> i would tend to agree with him if i were happier about the design of seat belts but i am not happy about their design so as to be comfortable for all shapes and sizes of wearer and i repeat that i rate comfort for the driver of a car very high indeed <e> <s> an uncomfortable driver is an inattentive and even bad-tempered one and that is very dangerous <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to apologise to your lordships for not having given earlier notice of my wish to speak <e> <s> i did not realise until the middle of the debate that the three points i should like to make were unlikely to be made <e> <s> i should also like to add my congratulations to those of your lordships to the noble baroness lady carnegy on a most distinguished maiden speech and to the noble baroness lady seear on the report of her select committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> in view of the fact that the matter is of some considerable urgency would the government consider making additional resources and staff available to the committee to enable them possibly to report earlier <e> <s> secondly in view of the fact that the press release announcing the setting up of the committee stated quite clearly that religious viewpoints would be represented on that committee would the government agree either that the composition of the committee is unsatisfactory or that the press release was misleading <e>", "<cs> my lords since i hope that this committee will investigate not only what some noble lords have said but also genetic engineering and experiments on foetuses would the government find it possible to suggest to the medical profession that pending the report of the committee they should call a halt in experimentation in the meantime <e>", "<cs> my lords what plans if any do the government have to provide incentives to people to establish suitable processing mills particularly in view of the fact that their encouragement of afforestation is already leading to an increased yield <e>", "<cs> my lords last week in his maiden speech the right reverend prelate the bishop of wakefield said that he welcomed the assurance that the hunt committee had given that cable operators would be bound by existing standards of good taste and decency <e> <s> i cannot take a very complacent view of existing standards which have been falling for the last years <e> <s> i support all that has been said this evening by the noble lords lord nugent and lord swinfen the noble viscount lord hanworth the noble earl lord longford and the noble lord lord beswick <e> <s> i would particularly like to add something to what the noble lord lord beswick has just said <e> <s> he gave us two examples the last of which was goodbye mr chips where a great deal was left to the imagination <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord campbell of alloway for raising this distressing subject this afternoon <e> <s> while we know that if they have been warned to look for them there are signs by which a mother can tell if a baby is reacting adversely to the whooping cough vaccine such as rolling of the eyes and raised temperature <e>", "<cs> my lords i wholeheartedly support the noble lord lord robertson of oakridge whose bill this is and i cannot agree with the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby <e> <s> this bill does not seek to alter the existing law it merely seeks to reword it so that its spirit is obeyed instead of being disregarded because it is too loosely phrased <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and gallant lord lord hill-norton the noble viscount lord caldecote and the noble lord lord murton of lindisfarne have already spoken with knowledge and authority on the vital part played by the merchant navy in the falklands campaign and i do not want to repeat what they said but to beg leave to agree with their observations <e> <s> although only about per cent <e> <s> of our merchant fleet was involved in many cases the ships sent were almost the only suitable ones for the purpose and we used three of the only nine big passenger ships that we have <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister said that no plantable land had yet been sold by the forestry commission may i ask why that has been the case <e> <s> is it just because there has been no demand <e>", "<cs> my lords i love my husband my children and my cat but unlike the noble lord lord marsh i love trains <e> <s> some of the happiest moments of my childhood were spent either in them or playing with them <e> <s> i find them intensely romantic unlike aeroplanes so i find the decline of the railways in the last years very sad as well as extremely inconvenient <e> <s> it is rather like seeing an old boyfriend become senile <e> <s> as the noble lord lord marsh has asked the government to make up their minds on what they want from the railways i propose to tell the house what i as a frequent traveller want from my railways and am not getting <e> <s> when the ordinary passenger like me does not get what he wants then he travels by other means where they exist and that is what a great many people including myself have done <e> <s> they have travelled by air instead and other means available <e>", "<cs> my lords that sounds a very good idea <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to wish the bill a speedy passage through the other house because i am so glad to think that at last the poor underprivileged english are to be equal to those of us who live in scotland who have always been able to get married in our own homes <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much welcome the bill of the noble earl lord onslow <e> <s> we have needed some legislation of this kind for a long time <e> <s> in fact when i realised what the present situation was i was quite horrified <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord mishcon spoke for myself and everybody else in the country when he underlined that fact <e> <s> i therefore very warmly support the intention of the noble earls bill and i very much hope that if the government cannot accept it with some amendment they will very soon produce a bill of their own which will put things right <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down may i ask him whether the scottish office has produced a similar consultative document of which we have never heard and which we have not been offered on the little pink slips that we are sent <e>", "<cs> my

many other good reasons have been <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble earl who has just spoken i too heartily welcome this white paper and i want to congratulate the government on having produced it <e> <s> the subject is a highly technical one but the paper is so clearly written that even i can understand most of it <e> <s> i should like to touch briefly on a few points <e> <s> first regarding the controversy about co-axial versus optical fibre cable surely we must look ahead and use the most advanced technology available both for the sake of our own system in the long term and for the sake of our export trade <e> <s> i therefore urge the government to do all in their power whether by stick or by carrot or both to encourage the use of fibre optic cable in the development of which britain leads the world <e> <s> it must be best to start with the most up-to-date equipment <e> <s> not to do so would be like deliberately equipping a new house with an old-fashioned fuse box instead of with contact-breakers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes for asking a question which i have been wanting to ask for a very long time <e> <s> i am particularly concerned about the ineligibility of married women for invalid care allowance and also about the level of that allowance <e> <s> nowadays a very large percentage of married women work full or part time and as the noble lord lord banks has said they can earn substantial salaries <e> <s> the hourly rate for a cleaner in london is now to an hour which for a -hour week means to a week

not prove that there is a linkage between acid rain and the kind of damage imputed to it but suggests strongly that the causes of the damage are quite different <e>", "<cs> the object of this amendment is to bridge the gap which yawns between oftel and the cable authority <e> <s> in view of the fact that different government departments are not noted for cooperating with one another to put it mildly and that with both present and future developments such as prestel telebanking and teleshopping cable and telecommunications are inextricably entwined it is essential whether the government like it or not that the duty of oftel and the cable authority to cooperate should be clearly written into both this bill and the cable and broadcasting bill because ministerial assurances however sincere have no legal force <e> <s> moreover i believe that the bridging of the gap between oftel and the cable authority will be welcomed by british telecom who because of the interplay between the

owners this is rarely a problem in the country <e> <s> merely notifying the owner or the proprietor so that he has a chance to object or possibly make constructive representations is quite another
