["<cs> my lords i should like to start by congratulating my noble friend on his appointment to northern ireland and to assure him that whether he likes it or no he will find himself converted to a good ulsterman before very long and i feel very happy with his most thoughtful speech today <e> <s> i also studied with great difficulty the debate in another place in the form in which it was presented and i found much to encourage me in the approach of his right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise first of all to thank the noble lord lord dunleath for putting this question <e> <s> whatever anybody may think about the timing being right or wrong surely it is vindicated by the number of very able speakers who have spoken here today <e> <s> i congratulate him on that <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate my noble friend the duke of abercorn on his maiden speech <e> <s> he spoke with great clarity as one would expect <e> <s> the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord slightly misunderstands me <e> <s> i was talking on this issue <e> <s> i believe it was wrong to give proportional representation to northern ireland without having it for the rest of the united kingdom <e> <s> the net result as on so many occasions when to have had intelligent reforms applied to northern ireland is that it has backfired on us <e> <s> this one has backfired like nobodys business and has produced a very difficult situation for the official unionists <e> <s> they are certain and i too am certain of it that if an assembly or a conference fails to reach a proper agreement it will reopen the bitterness which to some extent has died down and the only gainer from that will be dr paisley and his party <e> <s> i am certain that if we fail on this conference then a lasting settlement will be that much harder to achieve because every time that we have tried to do something to arrive at a settlement it has made the problem much more difficult for the next time <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to welcome the noble lord lord underhill and his introduction to this debate which is most timely and was very ably presented <e> <s> i greatly look forward to hearing him again on the affairs of northern ireland for after years of experience his knowledge is very deep <e> <s> looking at him as he turned to sit down i am not at all sure that i do not see the track of the whip of the noble lord lord blease upon his shoulders to make him come and speak here today <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord blease will keep cracking that whip because it is a contribution that we certainly value <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill covered a very wide spectrum and i should like to underline one or two of the remarks he made <e>", "<cs> my lords might i ask the noble lord that the next time this order is debated we should deal with it at an earlier time when certain subjects could be raised <e> <s> i think that this is the second time that it has been moved at the end of a long day when people are fed up with listening to the problems of northern ireland <e> <s> i think there is an issue which cannot he let go and which will take me one minute to mention <e> <s> i should like to support a statement by the honourable member for west belfast mr fitt only i would put it in slightly different terms <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak from northern ireland and i am very fearful seeing the number of devon peers here because of their ninety men of valour <e> <s> i go by boat from belfast to liverpool on many occasions and i hope the next time i come that i am not sunk by a devon cruiser <e> <s> while i applaud very much all that the noble lord lord sandford has said i am going to put my finger on what i believe to be a vital omission in this particular bill <e> <s> i speak from years experience on a county council and from having been in the chair and having prepared a council for the rush of tourists which was bound to come <e> <s> therefore my approach to all these matters must be with regard to the preservation of the great assets that we have <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to welcome these regulations very much <e> <s> last week i drew attention to the fact that the beef herds in northern ireland have gone down by per cent <e> <s> and an awful lot of beef conies to this country from northern ireland <e> <s> there are a great many farmers in northern ireland who depend entirely on it <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house i should first like to apologise for not having put my name down to speak <e> <s> i went to the whips office and discussed the number of speakers but forgot to tell them that i was going to put my name down <e> <s> therefore i apologise and i am grateful to the house for allowing me to speak <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by saying how grateful i am to the noble lord lord dunleath for opening this debate and for instituting it <e> <s> the other day we discussed the criminal justice scotland bill and as i was walking through the lobby behind the noble lord lord peart i heard someone say i have always been in favour of devolution for scotland because nothing will get rid of the scots quicker than devolution <e> <s> then another man said to him well there is one thing they are much better than the irish <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his reply <e> <s> can he tell us what views have been expressed by the sports councils of the united kingdom and if they have not expressed a corporate view at this stage some weeks or more after the invasion of afghanistan can he press them to do so <e> <s> because it seems to me that as the national bodies representing sport it is time that they expressed some view <e> <s> can he also give an assurance to all the sports which have supported the government in their appeal to boycott the olympics that not only will financial support if it is financial support that the government are prepared to give them be given for the staging of world class competitions for the year but in view of the fact <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by congratulating my noble friend lord sandford for his presentation of the report <e> <s> i know the tremendous trouble he has taken over travelling across europe to find out what are the policies for rural areas in other countries <e> <s> it is an advantage to me to be speaking so far down the list in todays debateso much has already been said that it leaves me with a lot of blue pencil lines through what i was going to say <e> <s> i support practically everything that has been said <e> <s> i support in particular what was said by the noble lord lord mackie of benshie about the extension of these experiments in the western isles to the highland areas <e> <s> i should like there to be an extension of that sort of principle to larger areas in my own country of northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords having listened to the speeches this afternoon it is with considerable trepidation that i rise to congratulate the noble lord lord walston on having introduced the debate and to support him and all other noble lords in their congratulations of the staff <e> <s> when one has heard the evidence put before the committee one is amazed to see how shortly and clearly it has been assembled and how the conclusions of the committee have been placed before us so well <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by welcoming the order as a whole and by thanking the noble lord lord elton for his explanation <e> <s> however i should like to raise a few points on the order <e> <s> the first concerns the control of the courts as a whole in northern ireland <e> <s> under the judicature northern ireland act which <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his reply <e> <s> i should like to ask him whether the government are aware that the industry has almost halved since we joined the common market and further whether he is aware that a very small reduction in <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the underground have a very special hazard for people with even small amounts of luggage <e> <s> they have a barrier above a set of stairs before one goes down so that one cannot take a trolley down to the platform <e> <s> this is an absolute barrier to one getting through and one does not even have to have much luggage for it to be quite a lot to carry down the stairs <e>", "<cs> my lords can i ask the noble lord whether he is stating that the governing bodies will now have more in their hands from this saving <e> <s> secondly can the noble lord tell me why he has decided now that he will consult regularly and take advice regularly from the chairman of the new sports council when up-to-date he has failed to consult the present chairman of the present sports council about a fundamental matter of the reorganisation of sport in northern ireland bearing in mind that the two people the chairman of the new sports council and the chairman of the present sports council are one and the same person <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to welcome this appropriation order explaining as it does the use of money in northern ireland <e> <s> i should like to begin by paying a tribute to the secretary of states team in their managing to achieve such tremendous industrial promotion <e> <s> it may be inadequate but in the economic climate today managing to trap lear fan into coming into aldegrove with jobs is a magnificent achievement but all of that does not in any way detract from the very serious unemployment situation which we face in northern ireland <e> <s> i should like to support my noble friend lord moyola in his plea that the question of unemployment should be given what would appear to me to be a higher priority than at present <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord give way <e> <s> this is the assassination about to take place <e> <s> would the noble lord accept that the real feeling and i think throughout this house was that you have these two bodies the civil service and the sports council staff and the sports council staff and the general public feel that this has been done in a very unfair and undercover way <e> <s> personally i accept the administrative decision <e> <s> i find it difficult to accept that it was done fairly for the people who are about to be axed <e> <s> that is the major issue <e> <s> i do not think i raised the question about the administration of sport not continuing <e> <s> it is a question of fairness <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by thanking the noble lord lord elton for his introduction of the continuation order <e> <s> i should also like to say how pleased i was and how pleased the people in fintona were when the noble lord went down to baronscourt after a huge bomb had been exploded in fintona <e> <s> he jumped in his car and went off to see them and talk to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by thanking my noble friend for his explanatory document which i found here when i arrived <e> <s> it is a very readable document and i have been able to read and understand it between the time that i arrived and now and i thank him for its very good description <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in the tributes to my noble friend lord elton on his introduction of this order and to say how impressed i was with the speeches of the noble lords lord hampton and lord blease <e> <s> i think that together they covered an enormous amount <e> <s> the speech by the noble lord lord hampton was filled with compassion sincerity and a good deal of determination <e> <s> i appreciate that very much <e> <s> i should like to join with my noble friend and i hope that when he refers to me in his speech this time he will still call me his noble friend for i noticed the omission but i feel it was a sin of omission rather than of commission in assuring the house that so far the size of the demonstrations by the h-block supporters the smash h-block people has been very small <e> <s> there have been occasions in real republican areas where only people have turned up <e> <s> this is a great tribute to the leaders in the area <e> <s> nobody knows unless they go to those areas of the intimidation and the appalling pressure that people in those areas are under <e> <s> it is a very finely-balanced position at the moment <e> <s> every-thing should be done to make sure that there is no confrontation and nothing to produce a different frame of mind <e> <s> i should like also to join with others in paying tribute to the forces to the judges and to those who administer the law <e> <s> they have a dangerous task and they do it with great fortitude and can be subject to no criticism <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only tell you that i think that that was one of the tragic mistakes of a misguided government <e> <s> that would be the opinion of many people <e> <s> i should like to feel that at the meeting of the prime minister and mr haughey the question of extradition was raised because a very serious decision was made in the courts of justice in dublin <e> <s> noble lords will remember that we passed a criminal jurisdiction act and under that the idealists believed that a man who committed a crime in the north of ireland and was apprehended in the south would then be tried by those courts <e> <s> we had a case which went before the courts one only and that case before it went down was examined by the attorney-general and by the dpp in northern ireland and was passed to the attorney-general and the dpp in the irish republic <e> <s> the evidence was there as far as they were concerned for a <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend make sure that where the conditions make it possible that is the buildings and other conditions the same sort of rgime is applied in the rest of the <e>", "<cs> my lords after the erudite speeches which have preceded mine i am very awestruck in taking up the cudgels in support of this order <e> <s> i am going to ask for the extreme indulgence of this house if i do not stick absolutely directly to the subject of this order <e> <s> the alternatives which we have from northern ireland are very often to try to put down a motion and debate it or else to be slightly <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his clear explanation of the order which i welcome and wish every success <e> <s> like the noble lord lord blease i have certain reservations about its limitations and there are certainly other areas of northern ireland that i know where there is an urgent case for a review and for enterprise zones to be set up <e> <s> however i feel that the whole business is far too timid because at present an economic holocaust is driving its way through northern ireland <e> <s> i do not feel qualified to discuss the effects of government policy in great britain but i can say with absolute authority that the destruction of the industrial base of northern ireland is rapidly reaching completion so much so that when eventual recovery occurs in great britain the industrial base of northern ireland will have been destroyed <e>", "<cs> my lords it was per job multiplied by million people <e> <s> i think that is right <e>", "<cs> my lords i stand corrected if my noble friend was correcting me but i think i have said enough to demonstrate the measure of the problem facing the government <e> <s> indeed the effort of the experimental enterprise zones as they have been called is really very small compared with the very large problem facing the government <e> <s> that <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the statement made by my noble friend on what to us especially in the border area is a major disaster <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble and learned lord give way <e> <s> he must be unaware of the fact that in large areas of fermanagh and south tyrone and in the methodist college and in grammar schools throughout northern ireland there is in fact integrated education in a very very large way but in fermanagh and south tyrone which i know about intimately it has been going on for hundreds of years and is only just now as a result of the roman catholic church being segregated <e> <s> in spite of that we still have a number of roman catholic parents who defy their church and send their children to state schools <e> <s> this idea that catholics never met protestants may apply in some areas but certainly there are many areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by thanking my noble friend for his introduction of this order <e> <s> as a result of it this debate has certainly been interesting and widespread <e> <s> before getting on to what i intend to say i would say to the noble earl lord longford that to use economic pressure on northern ireland to try to persude protestant people to change their allegiance is tantamount to creating a violent revolution <e> <s> maybe if northern ireland is costing another million than the average in the united kingdom the same sort of pressure might be applied to liverpool merseyside where it must be costing it cannot be costed separately the rest of london and the south of england something of the same order per head of population <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> would it surprise him <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by thanking my noble friend lord elton for his explanation of this order <e> <s> i should also like to say how much i agreed with the noble lord lord donaldson in his plea on behalf of agriculture <e> <s> he and i had a word some time ago and we agreed that agriculture was something which needed special emphasis within this house <e> <s> so the noble lord has really gutted my speech for me and i should just like to support what he said about the need and maybe to emphasise one or two points <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by paying a tribute and a very genuine tribute to our staff and to the drafters of this report <e> <s> i have sent it round to a number of people in northern ireland to get their opinions on it <e> <s> one and all have said that it is the best written report that they have ever read and explains a rather complicated subject well especially when the phrase cereal substitutes which means something rather different from what we are discussing is used <e> <s> my first point concerns the clarity with which this report is written <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by welcoming the speech by my noble friend lord gowrie <e> <s> i should like to say that as far as i am concerned it was the best speech i have heard made by a government minister <e> <s> i hope the noble lord lord donaldson will not take this in any way as an affront but it was quite the best speech that i have heard delivered from the front bench <e> <s> it showed a tremendous understanding acquired in a short time <e> <s> i certainly welcome my noble friends translation to his position in the northern ireland office and i look forward to co-operating with him very much <e> <s> i want to get that out of the way first because there are considerable areas in which i might disagree with him when it comes to the next debate <e> <s> i should also like at this point in time to say that i am fully aware of the importance of having the closest possible co-operation with the irish government in dublin on security matters and indeed on other matters <e> <s> again i say that because at a later date i shall be fairly critical of the dublin governments approach on extradition <e>", "<cs> my lord i thank the noble lord for his interruption but it does not alter my conviction nor the conviction of by far the majority of people in northern ireland who consider that a gesture on the part of the irish government for dealing with fugitive criminals would be a matter of the highest political importance <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by thanking my noble friend lord moyola for raising this subject even if it is just before christmas <e> <s> i should like to support him in this contention that until there is peace for a considerable length of time initiatives on devolved government are not going to succeed <e> <s> while listening to him speak on his criticism of the advice that the government get from stormont castle criticism which i support i wonder whether the government would take on board a brand new idea for service by the civil servants transferred from london to belfast that at least for a month before taking up residence on the gold coast in county down or in stormont that they should live with a northern irish family it does not matter of which political persuasion a long way from belfast preferably on the border <e> <s> they might then come to stormont with their eyes rather wider open than they appear to have <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i have ever made a speech in this house when the noble earl was present when he has not found it necessary to interrupt or correct me on something <e> <s> i will say absolutely and clearly that the language in which they spoke up to the last five or six weeks has <e>", "<cs> that may be the noble earls opinion <e> <s> he is better educated than i am in semantics no doubt <e> <s> i welcome sincerely the hopes of improved trade relations <e> <s> if you live in our part of the world and see the terrible problems which face us the meat factories where in one week they are swamped with beasts hut because an mca comes in the next week they are left with no beasts to kill <e> <s> the same thing applies to the meat factories on the other side of the border <e> <s> yes there is a job to do <e> <s> gas and electricity are certainly jobs to do <e> <s> nobody should feel that in the south of ireland in the improvement of trade relations that there is a crock of gold waiting for us to pick up <e> <s> we arc all in the very depths of an appalling slump <e>", "<cs> will the noble earl give way <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl is not giving any credit to this house <e> <s> in no way can i imagine anybody in this house who believes that terrorism is only on one side but there is no question that the majority of the terrorism has been carried out by the ira <e> <s> further to that he is i believe alluding to me as not having condemned it <e> <s> i have condemned all terrorism all murder whether it be protestant or catholic all my life <e> <s> further the noble earl must agree that whatever protestant murders have been committed the murderers are so inefficient about being clandestine that they are caught <e> <s> my problem in my county of fermanagh is that we have had murders and only two have been solved <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl give way again <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl is incredibly naive if he honestly believes that the names of the murderers are not known to the prime minister of the irish republic <e> <s> they are known to the police to the garda and to the prime minister <e> <s> the irish republic cannot touch them because they have committed no crime in the irish republic <e> <s> the crime has been commited in the north and it is not possible to get the evidence because the irish republic will not allow the royal ulster constabulary to question the people <e>", "<cs> but <e>", "<cs> my lords i first wish to thank my noble friend lord mottistone for his very able introduction of this report and i also agree with other noble lords in paying their compliments on his handling of the committee as its chairman <e> <s> i would also like to join with the noble lord who expressed his sorrow that the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos was not taking part in this debate because at the other meetings at which he has chaired the committee we could not have been better chaired <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i would like to join in the congratulations to lord cledwyn of penrhos <e> <s> for those who have not served under his chairmanship it is a pleasure they will certainly look forward to as his handling of this committee is really absolutely first class <e> <s> i should like also at this point to pay tribute to our specialist advisers and the clerks for producing such a readable and sensible report out of such a very complex matter and from such very complex evidence as is produced <e> <s> those who read that evidence will understand their ability when they have managed to produce such a concise readable and intelligent report <e> <s> the noble lord lord stanley said that he was not sure how much wiser he was on the direction he should go but i am jolly sure he is a great deal wiser on the problems than he was before reading the report <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell the house why there has been such a delay in the presentation of the case for the extension of the less favoured areas in the whole of the united kingdom bearing in mind that the area which has benefited in scotland is much greater than anywhere else in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend please extend the deepest sympathy of this house to the soldier in the royal anglian regiment who was foully burnt by teenage petrol-throwing bombers two nights ago <e> <s> is the minister aware that no baton round was fired <e> <s> if it had perhaps the story might have been different <e> <s> may i ask my noble friend to assure the house that many lives have in the past been saved by the use of baton rounds <e> <s> while filled with admiration for our forces in the south atlantic may i ask him to see to it that the relatives of those forces in northern ireland receive the same cherishment of love as will be expressed to the relatives of those lost in the south atlantic <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by paying tribute to my noble friend lord gowrie on his presentation of the bill <e> <s> i have never heard a bill about northern ireland presented with greater breadth <e> <s> the noble earl mentioned the achievements of northern ireland <e> <s> i feel that it would be right at this moment to refer to the achievement of the football team in spain when we equalled the football team of england <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble duke give way <e> <s> i think that the noble duke must have misunderstood me <e> <s> i did not say that there was not a need for it <e> <s> i made it clear that i was a supporter of devolution as such <e> <s> i said that if this thing basically went wrong then we would be far further back and in a far worse state i think that my noble friend lord moyola said exactly the same than we would be if we had not tried it <e> <s> my problem is that i am absolutely convinced that the second stage will not occur <e> <s> my conviction is based on my knowledge of the people to whom i speak and who i meet every single day <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a question before the noble earl sits down which he has now done and i think my noble friend lord oneill also has a question <e> <s> i asked the noble earl a specific question on the attachment of the government to the union <e> <s> will he make it clear that the government consider it their duty to govern northern ireland in such a way that it is their hope will and pleasure that all members of the community whatever section they belong to in northern ireland would wish to remain part of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not detain the house for more than a minute <e> <s> first i should like to join with my noble friend in agreeing that it is necessary to have the order <e> <s> secondly while i support the noble lord lord hylton in his raising of problems about delays and such matters i feel that it should not be forgotten that the suspension of certain civil rights is necessary to give the public confidence that the forces of law and order can operate <e>", "<cs> i rise with a slightly ambivalent attitude because i feel that were local government authority to be devolved as it were upon administrative authority to be devolved upon the assembly there would be no possibility of having devolved government at a later date <e> <s> but having said that i have a great deal of sympathy with my noble friend in asking for this authority to be put into the bill subject maybe to a special order in council because i am afraid that i am pessimistic about the hope that devolved government will arise <e> <s> therefore i am equally against another session at a later date when it will be seen that while the assembly may survive it is not surviving as a devolved government and we shall then have to go through some other legislative process in order to carry out some form of addition to democracy within northern ireland <e> <s> that is my ambivalence <e>", "<cs> i do not want to detain your lordships prior to a very important statement being repeated but i would say that there are tremendous anomalies here <e> <s> for instance if on a housing estate there is in the road a hole filled with litter that is for central government and therefore westminster to deal with <e> <s> if the hole is in the pavement that is for the housing executive to deal with and if there is a hole in both the road and the pavement then there is an argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel it would be inappropriate coming from northern ireland and dealing with northern ireland matters today if i did not express and while i cannot claim to be a representative of northern ireland i know i represent the views of the people of northern ireland our absolute horror at what has happened <e> <s> i would say to the government bearing in mind the words of the minister of defence mr collins in which he expressed the view that it was unreasonable to expect security cooperation if there was not political co-operation that they must pursue the terrorists in dublin to the absolute maximum <e> <s> but my lords the people who have been killed have been in our province and have defended us so we feel very strongly about it indeed <e>", "<cs> i wanted to raise two points for the sake of clarity <e> <s> they concern the question of committees which the assembly will set up <e> <s> it is quite often forgotten that when the parliament of northern ireland and the government of northern ireland was first set up matters of interference in everyday affairs was of a very limited extent <e> <s> it was quite easy to define the areas of responsibility <e> <s> for instance the ministry of agriculture was to do with the agriculture of northern ireland <e> <s> as time has gone on and especially during the war more and more of the work of various ministries especially the ministry of agriculture has been carried out as agents for the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble earl this <e> <s> in the previous executive matters of agriculture were answered by the minister for agriculture even where they were agency matters <e> <s> is that going to be the same <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend would look at it and let me know <e>", "<cs> i put my name to this amendment because from the beginning when the northern ireland government accepted the question of a referendum it has always worried me exactly what it means <e> <s> is it point per cent <e> <s> is it point per cent <e> <s> when in time do the united kingdom government consider that the point has arrived on figures at which northern ireland should in fact be expelled <e> <s> i felt that this was a useful probing amendment to find out the views of the government <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank my noble friend for his explanation which was certainly helpful <e> <s> however i really cannot see why the advocacy of the importance of the unity of the united kingdom prevents what i call warmth in approach and what he might describe as a subjective approach <e> <s> surely irrespective of colour creed or anything else and whatever the figures in the religious divide the government will want to ensure that people will wish to <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e> <s> i actually accepted what my noble friend had said <e> <s> i took up merely the one point on which i thought his response was unsatisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords while not supporting this amendment at this time i would like to pursue the question of the guarantee <e> <s> having read the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate my noble friend on the way he has conducted this bill and while i do not agree that it is in fact a good thing like everybody else and not for the first time i shall do my very best to see that it works as well as it possibly can <e>", "<cs> my lords i would like to start by congratulating my noble friend lord gowrie on his presentation <e> <s> the figures show that we have a very energetic secretary of state and ministers <e> <s> we have always been extremely lucky and our present secretary of state in the way he cares and talks about unemployment is one of the best that we could possibly have <e> <s> the whole of northern ireland is conscious that he worries terribly about unemployment and all the problems in northern ireland right across the board <e> <s> all his ministers work extremely hard and we are very grateful to them for that <e>", "<cs> my lords in welcoming the order may i make particular reference to historic buildings preservation because i think that in this branch of the department we have an excellent team <e> <s> i have an interest to declare in that i have a listed building <e> <s> throughout their work they are particularly helpful to everybody no matter whether it is the smallest cottage that is preserved or a large mansion such as that of my noble friend <e> <s> they are absolute experts they are architects and the whole team works <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by declaring an interest <e> <s> my interest is on two grounds <e> <s> first i am a farmer and secondly i am a consumer so i think i can see things absolutely fairly <e> <s> there may be some who say that i see things from the farmers eyes more fairly than i do from the consumers eyes but like most people i am vitally interested in both aspects <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him whether he would not agree that what he is proposing is not the use of the common agricultural policy but the use of social funds <e> <s> would he not agree that the use of cap funds is causing considerable discontent with the cap and that it would be better to make more use of social funds in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords we have listened to the noble earl lord longford with great interest <e> <s> whatever the problems about the nephew living in belfast in the case in which the noble earl was concerned i can assure the noble earl that if he were to come to belfast he would not be considered a dangerous person <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be quite wrong for this house to feel that the noble earl alone has the right to speak for the irish derived community in this country <e> <s> i do not know how many members of the irish population here are in the societies which the noble earl represents but i can say with absolute certainty that there are hundreds of thousands of irish citizens who are perfectly content and who feel that this act is no threat to them at all <e> <s> they have a great abhorrence of violence just as the noble earl does but they feel that their enjoyment of civil rights in this country justifies the act as it is although there are problems in balancing between freedoms civic rights and the need to combat terrorism <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start be welcoming this order <e> <s> i have given my noble friend notice of two questions which i want to raise <e> <s> i should like to start by welcoming the establishment now of the idb the industrial development board <e> <s> when i heard the noble lord lord underhill talking about de lorean i just hoped that we shall not have what could be called the de lorean factor inhibiting the idb from taking risks again <e> <s> the situation in northern ireland with its very high unacceptably high unemployment means that there is no possibility of getting large-scale investment without taking risks and without the government taking risks <e> <s> when many years ago we had another failure in northern ireland it was called seenozip the total amount was only or something like that but i can tell your lordships from my experience in the ministry of commerce that there was a seenozip complex and for some time those in charge of government grants were over-cautious in what they were doing <e> <s> i should like to feel that the hands of the idb are not being tied by the failure of the past <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to the minister for the fact that my name does not appear on the list of speakers <e> <s> i thought i gave my name to the whips office last week when i told them that the minister had kindly agreed to our subcommittee having a debate on northern ireland agriculture <e> <s> i apologise to the house and to the minister <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords but the noble lord has taken me wrong <e> <s> i am grateful to him for raising the subject because it is one i have meant to raise many times <e> <s> i am also very grateful to the noble lord lord underhill for raising the absolute fib and distortion of facts concerning the bbc and television and should like to support the noble lord lord dunleath in his protest in that respect <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i should like to rise and congratulate the noble lord lord fitt on his appearance in this house and on his speech <e> <s> i agree with what the noble lord lord donaldson said about how much he will contribute on many matters to this house <e> <s> the noble lord lord fitt and i have known each other for a very long time and i think that we have a mutual respect <e> <s> it is a great pleasure to follow him and his maiden speech today was certainly the trigger which prompted me to speak on this particular order because this draft measure has been very fully discussed with many people <e> <s> it has not satisfied everybody and i personally have one or two reservations <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add my expression of horror at what happened last night <e> <s> it has increased the danger of retaliation <e> <s> i can only say that any of us who live in northern ireland in areas which are under attack will have to do a lot to try to convey confidence back to the people who suffered this appalling tragedy <e>", "<cs> my lords i like other noble lords would like to congratulate the noble lord lord kings norton on his presentation of the report <e> <s> i should also like to thank my noble friend lord mottistone for his reference to me <e> <s> instead of giving way as rapidly as they did on the importation of uht milk from other parts of the world i should like to encourage the government to follow the example of other countries to challenge under article restrictive practices on transport <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt my noble friend <e> <s> he is correct in saying that very often the post is open from pm to pm but it is as a result of requests put in hours ahead and any trader who does not put in a request hours ahead finds a closed post <e> <s> there is that rigidity <e> <s> a trader cannot arrive on the chance of finding the post open because somebody else has made a request and get through <e> <s> the fact is that rigidity is there <e> <s> the post is closed at oclock not one minute after and any trader who arrives after that irrespective of whether the post is manned does not get through if he has not made a request hours before <e> <s> this does not apply at any continental post <e>", "<cs> my lords before i get down to the meat of the business i should like to join other noble lords in their congratulations to the noble lord lord henderson <e> <s> i do not think that i have ever heard a tribute paid in better terms than the tribute by the noble lord lord shackleton and i should like to endorse everything that he has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord underhill for his very clear introduction <e> <s> i should like to say how much i endorse everything that he has said and all the questions that he has asked <e> <s> i hope that i will not repeat his questions and that i will deal with the report from a slightly different angle <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend has slightly misunderstood <e> <s> first of all i apologise for doing an injustice to my noble friend <e> <s> i have been given wrong information which i genuinely believed to be true <e> <s> secondly i have not been arguing that it was wrong for the secretary of state to be involved in political decisions <e> <s> i have been totally in favour of it <e> <s> but the impression that has got round and that has left the prison staff and ulster believing that the prison staff were taking all the blame is that there was no political interference in the maze <e> <s> there has to be political interference in the running of the prison and i entirely accept it <e> <s> but what appears to have happened so far as the general public is concerned is that the secretary of state has dissociated himself from those political decisions which were the scene from which the escape occurred <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord to tell me what alienation means in this context <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by thanking the noble lord for his very comprehensive review of the legislation and of sir george bakers report <e> <s> i do not think he would thank me very much if i accepted his challenge to go into the report in detail because together with the noble lord lord underhill i think we should be here to the very early hours and certainly i am not very good at dealing with matters in detail <e> <s> however he was very rash when he asked us to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like most warmly to welcome this order <e> <s> i have anticipated it for so long that i wondered whether any of us here would live to see it <e> <s> we have been waiting and waiting and therefore i welcome it most sincerely <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for his introduction of the order and also to say how pleased i am to be speaking after the noble lord lord hylton because luckily he was almost as out of order as i intend to be <e> <s> i should like to thank my noble friends lord denham and lord lyell <e> <s> i gave them notice that i would be slightly out of order and i am delighted that lord hylton has started the rot <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by congratulating the noble lord lord plowden on his presentation and especially on the way he conducted the inquiry <e> <s> i think there is quite a contrast between his vigour on this fishing inquiry and the unit pricing i know i sympathised and agreed with him about the unit pricing being a difficult inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that agriculture is the most important industry in northern ireland <e> <s> is he also aware that with the average size of farm being acres no matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble earl for putting this question down <e> <s> he has as usual argued his case with great compassion and concern for what he believes to be the underdog <e> <s> i am not sure that his perception of the underdog is quite correct <e> <s> still the noble earl has argued his case with great compassion <e>", "<cs> my lords i will answer the noble earl by saying that on the st february the newsletter published the fact that he was in mr binghams house <e>", "<cs> my lords i may have misheard what the noble lord said <e> <s> did he say that the power-sharing executive failed because the irish dimension was not strong or did he not <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by thanking my noble friend for his introduction of the order and to say that i welcome it <e> <s> i also welcome very much the fact that the noble lord lord underhill is back in his place <e> <s> he is a great contributor on northern ireland matters <e>", "<cs> my lords the castlewellan mob was not orange <e> <s> it was made up entirely of what are called loyalists <e> <s> but there was no orange organisation and no orangemen there <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his replies <e> <s> can he tell me whether there is any indication that his noble friends or his right honourable friends know how many horses there are in the country <e> <s> is he aware that the leisure industry is under tremendous verbal support from his colleagues <e> <s> in this particular case the riding fraternity is one of the fastest growing parts of the leisure industry but the government are not doing very much to support it <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend not agree that before they get to the riding schools which are rated they have to be bred <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first of all without any reservation condemn the action of yesterday which was a disaster for northern ireland <e> <s> i should be pleased if your lordships would allow me to associate myself in the tribute to the ruc and the army <e> <s> their task has been immeasurably difficult <e> <s> when their conduct is reported on it will be shown that of the number of incidents that they handled there were very few at which anybody could point a finger <e>", "<cs> temporarily suspending the conference thereby enabling talks to take place <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to welcome this order and to thank my noble friend for the way he has introduced it <e> <s> i should like to say how much i support the noble lord lord fitt in his remarks about the general situation in northern ireland <e> <s> it is to that effect that i should like to attribute my remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by thanking what are called the proper channels for the privilege of allowing me to speak after the two noble lords who have introduced this debate <e> <s> it is the more strange that they have done so in that they know i shall not be painting the broad picture which the two noble lords have painted so exquisitely <e> <s> i shall be confining myself to the narrower problems of northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support this order and to thank my noble friend for his introduction <e> <s> for me this is a very sad day <e> <s> yesterday i took part in our church in the burial ceremony of ivan crawford <e> <s> he was a young man born and bred on colebrooke <e> <s> his father and all his uncles were involved in colebrooke or brookeborough <e> <s> he was an upright peaceful and dutiful man <e> <s> he was one of the best citizens that you could possibly imagine <e>", "<cs> my lords evil is a subjective concept <e> <s> i think the word is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i must make a correction <e> <s> the ruc operated against the yobs in the shankhill many times including when constable arbuckle was murdered to take one incident <e> <s> the idea that the ruc never operated except in one way is not true or fair <e> <s> they are now a brilliantly led brilliantly equipped and brilliantly trained force operating with total impartiality and that is what matters not the past <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house having heard the noble earl i shall substitute the word bad because it was a very bad thing which was done <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not think that years is quite a long time for it to start <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his reply <e> <s> in view of the intimate connection which exists between her majestys government and the dublin government and the high incidence of aids in dublin due to the high level of drug abuse there will the government use the opportunities of the anglo-irish conference to ensure that condoms are freely available in the irish republic <e>", "<cs> my lords do i understand from my noble friend that this subject came up at the anglo-irish conference <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg your lordships indulgence for those who speak for the first time in this house <e> <s> i thank my noble friend the duke of abercorn for asking this question and thereby giving me a chance to speak on a non-controversial subject <e> <s> i am sure your lordships realise that it is difficult for an ulsterman to be non-controversial <e>", "<cs> my lords the northern ireland emergency provisions acts that we are discussing are perhaps two of the most important and serious pieces of legislation concerning any single part of the united kingdom <e> <s> as i am the new boy here perhaps it is a little out of place for me to say that it is surprising that this legislation which is definitely the most important legislation concerning northern ireland has to be dealt with at this time of night <e> <s> in casual conversations many noble lords have said how much more they would like to know about northern ireland <e> <s> when the business is carried out at this time of night it is not surprising that after a busy tuesday and a busier thursday to come people are not able to stay and listen <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord lyell for the attention that he has given to this order and for the way in which he dealt with it <e> <s> i too must say how welcome is the commentary on public expenditure plans to those such as myself who find it difficult to understand such colossal figures <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble lord lord prys-davies for the tremendous support that he has shown in his speech for the welfare of the people in the province <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much support the sentiments and feelings expressed so far in support of our forestry <e> <s> if we look back in time we see that by the middle ages much of the uk forests had been cut down <e> <s> it was only then realised that there was just enough forest left to supply local needs <e> <s> for a period there was a sustained management programme but this was largely abandoned with the discovery of coal as an alternative fuel and the acquisition of colonies which provided a cheap and seemingly inexhaustible supply of timber <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to say that due to the late stage at which northern ireland was brought into the bill no consultation took place with the ruc and northern ireland shooting organisations during the drafting stage <e> <s> that was a most unfortunate omission when one realises that we in northern ireland have by far the greatest experience of strict gun controls <e>", "<cs> when the army goes to a range draws weapons from an armoury and uses them on that range the public are quite happy <e> <s> why cannot the limited number of people who take part in practical shooting hold their weapons centrally not centrally in the whole country but close to their range so that they can then be drawn out for use on that range <e> <s> we do not have madmen in the army killing masses of people on the range and there is no reason to suppose that if shooting clubs had those restrictions we would run into any trouble <e>", "<cs> i cannot support this amendment because later in the bill we come on to the numbering of guns on certificates and i believe that when that part of the bill is reached it will provide the security for people who cannot remember how many shotguns they own and therefore if they lose them and those weapons are found it can at least be seen where the weapons came from <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may correct the last speaker as regards what happens in northern ireland <e> <s> the primary owner of a weapon has that weapon on his certificate <e> <s> anyone else who wishes to use it has it on loan <e> <s> when a weapon is sold and the certificate goes back to the firearms branch the branch automatically corrects the other certificate holders <e> <s> that problem does not arise <e>", "<cs> surely the problem is the vagueness of the term safe keeping <e> <s> my noble friend lord ferrers says that he cannot instruct chief constables <e> <s> the government have no say over speed limits or many other matters <e> <s> would it not be simple for a definition of safe keeping to be that these weapons should be held in a metal cabinet built for the purpose of safe keeping <e> <s> admittedly there would be slight variations in the amount of security supplied but every gun owner in the country would have a cabinet for the purpose of safe keeping <e>", "<cs> i support the noble ladys amendment from the point of view of experience <e> <s> we have this rule in northern ireland <e> <s> it is impossible to get permission from the police at short notice for shooting on somebody elses land by giving a days notice or whatever <e> <s> however it could be easily worked out assuming that one is a law-abiding person permitted to have a gun in the first place and it should be possible to state on a certificate that weapons may be used on land where one has permission to use them <e> <s> there would be absolutely no problem with that <e> <s> to have to go back through the police at a weekend or on a bank holiday is unreasonable and too restrictive <e>", "<cs> i should like to point out also that a lack of understanding of shooting prevails among the police <e> <s> when we started getting restrictive practices in northern ireland i mentioned to the police in a written letter accompanying my application that i might wish to take my rifle abroad to shoot wild boar in germany or stalk in scotland and they put on my certificate that i had permission to shoot wild boar in scotland and west germany <e>", "<cs> i should like to point out that in northern ireland the numbering of weapons has been carried out since <e> <s> the system works albeit that at present there may be many weapons which do not appear to have an owner or be held legally <e> <s> if we do not start now when shall we start <e> <s> the problem can only become worse <e> <s> from the point of view of the shooting community surely it must be right that the weapons are numbered on certificates <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may attempt to answer that <e> <s> there are very few shotguns without a number <e> <s> in addition it would be quite feasible from a forensic evidence point of view should a shotgun be used to link the empty case to a particular weapon <e> <s> they would probably not all be test fired on registration but if it were thought advisable that could happen <e> <s> we have hand guns test fired by the forensic department before a certificate is issued <e> <s> therefore should an empty case be found anywhere in the country assuming the weapon was lawfully held that case would match up to a weapon <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment <e> <s> i do so because when this register of weapons is compiled there will be chief constables who will be amazed by the number of shotguns involved <e> <s> it will be their natural inclination to think goodness that is far too many <e> <s> without instructions that they do not have the right to limit the number of guns held on a certificate i feel sure indeed we have heard this already that perhaps some chief constables will feel disinclined to license a person for all his weapons <e> <s> the only answer would be perhaps a bottle of scotch when the chief constable opens the letter with all the weapons listed on it <e>", "<cs> i withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great honour but yet a daunting and almost impossible task to follow my noble and learned friend lord hailsham <e> <s> there can be nothing left for me to say on the legal side <e> <s> thank goodness <e> <s> i should like to say something about the practical problems as they occur in northern ireland <e> <s> first in general i should like to welcome this order and i thank my noble friend lord lyell for explaining it so clearly to a layman such as i am <e> <s> i am sure it will help to improve the very difficult situation in northern ireland at present <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my sympathy to that expressed by the noble lord lord graham to my noble friend <e> <s> i also thank the noble lord lord carter for initiating a debate on this important subject <e> <s> i very much support his views and those of the noble lord lord graham on the definition near market and the other reservations they have expressed relating to rd funding in agriculture <e> <s> as a landowner and active farmer i must declare an interest <e> <s> i have also talked to the ulster farmers union to discover its views on the subject <e>", "<cs> in northern ireland we have a system of r-plates <e> <s> the r stands for restricted <e> <s> since the r has been mandatory <e> <s> the r denotes that the person passed his driving test within the previous year <e> <s> those with r-plates on their cars are restricted to a speed of miles an hour <e> <s> should another driver drive that car while still displaying the r-plates he or she is automatically restricted to that speed <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank my noble friend lady gardner of parkes for introducing this useful amendment <e> <s> before i speak on it i wish to register my surprise that this afternoon we have spent a long time talking about various matters where there is no statistical support for the arguments <e> <s> in northern ireland the royal ulster constabulary put together a complete booklet on road traffic accidents <e> <s> it has broken down the subject into many different parts <e> <s> it has analysed single-vehicle accidents weather conditions surface conditions accidents involving children the ages of people involved in accidents those of the people killed and so on <e> <s> the study is very comprehensive <e> <s> it prompts the question as to why the police forces in the remainder of the united kingdom seem only to be going around picking up the pieces after accidents and not analysing properly in their own areas what is going on and what is causing those accidents <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the governments intention in producing this bill even if it has taken years of violence before any government have seen fit to do so <e> <s> i am of course specifically referring to the declaration against violence <e> <s> i also support the penalties which can be imposed on a person proved to be in breach of the declaration <e>", "<cs> in supporting this amendment i cannot say a great deal more than the noble lord lord prys-davies has said <e> <s> i feel that the word wilfully should be inserted to protect those who may have made a slip of the tongue or whose words may be taken out of context <e> <s> that is a danger especially as those who support violence will miss no opportunity of taking honest law-abiding councillors or assembly members to court for any minor indiscretion <e> <s> we should remember that their aim is to destroy democratic government by whatever means which includes wasting the time of the judicial system <e> <s> therefore for a court to determine that a breach was made wilfully and not accidentally would be an important point <e> <s> i commend this amendment to the committee <e>", "<cs> i support the idea that there should be some amendment to the definition of terrorism <e> <s> i too should like to see the qualifying words removed <e> <s> we have just heard from the noble lord lord fitt that he wishes to have another aspect included in the definition <e> <s> there may be many other cases which have terrorist implications <e>", "<cs> in supporting this amendment i hope that i shall not repeat what has already been said <e> <s> however i believe that this amendment deals with and would solve the problem of whether or not this bill would be effective when passed <e>", "<cs> my lords ii should like first to take up a point made by my noble friend lord prior who talked about the acceptability of the attorney-general <e> <s> he seemed worried about how the attorney-general would he perceived by those in breach of the declaration <e> <s> the people of northern <e>", "<cs> my lords in addition the government are yet again asking the people of northern ireland to do something that they are not prepared to do <e> <s> for example they rightly refuse to sit <e>", "<cs> my lords my support for this amendment or a similar one at the committee stage remains <e> <s> i fully supported it for the reasons given then <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment is also tabled in my name and i thank the noble lord lord prys-davies for his remarks about the deletion of the phrase violence for political ends <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say that i support the intentions of this bill as i am sure does everyone in your lordships house <e> <s> however should this bill fail i hope that the next time when a measure such as this is raised a little more consideration can be given to the views of those of us who live in northern ireland <e> <s> clearly the government will find it fairly easy to defeat amendments on a division by virtue of the party system and the numbers going through the division lobbies <e> <s> however many noble lords who go through the division lobbies do not fully understand what happens in northern ireland <e> <s> sadly the situation is not as it is in the rest of the united kingdom <e> <s> when the northern ireland peers are unanimous in not trying to defeat the government but in trying to improve legislation to help the fight against terrorism i think that the government should sit down and consider their views at some length <e>", "<cs> i too would like to express support for that view <e> <s> especially from the point of view of someone with as little experience as myself i believe that it would be much better if noble lords had more time to prepare for the discussions <e>", "<cs> in putting forward amendments nos <e> <s> to we are endeavouring to strengthen the integrity and impartiality of the fair employment tribunal especially in the eyes of employers and employees in the province <e> <s> at present it would seem to me that the powers in clause to be held by the department leave all the cards

<e> <s> in addition to that in clause a northern ireland department may refuse to give an unqualified person any financial assistance <e> <s> subsection refers to <e>", "<cs> i feel that i should support the noble lord lord monson in this amendment or at least ask my noble friend the minister to look at something similar <e> <s> i shall not waste time by going into the details of the matter <e> <s> they are obvious in the context of terrorism as it exists in northern ireland <e> <s> i therefore support the noble lord in thought and maybe in hope for the future <e>", "<cs> in putting my name to this amendment i show support for it to the extent that yet again we are trying to improve the publics perception of the impartiality of this legislation <e> <s> it is not that we would doubt the job that the secretary of state is carrying out his willingness to provide certificates or anything else <e> <s> from time to time the secretary of state may change and indeed after an election the government may change <e> <s> it must not be <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to mention a matter which is slightly outside the scope of this debate the outrageous decision on extradition last week in dublin <e> <s> mr haughey has said that there will be no safe haven for terrorists <e> <s> these were not suspects they were convicted terrorists <e> <s> i wonder what has happened to this haven now <e>"]
