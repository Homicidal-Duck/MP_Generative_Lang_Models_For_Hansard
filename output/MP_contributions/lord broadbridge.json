["<cs> my lords i wish to urge you this evening to support the amendment in the name of the noble baroness lady birk <e> <s> it is not a wrecking amendment and is about the only constructive thing we can do with this objectionable bill at this stage <e> <s> for in or thereabouts the present government promised a searching review and reconstruction of the rating system but they have ducked the issue and now years later have got themselves into a corner to extricate themselves from which they have produced this bill <e> <s> doctors who deal with alcoholism have an expression that all you get if you give strong black coffee to a drunk is a wideawake drunk <e> <s> our rating arrangements in this country are in a state of drunkenness and this bill is the governments strong black coffee <e>"]
