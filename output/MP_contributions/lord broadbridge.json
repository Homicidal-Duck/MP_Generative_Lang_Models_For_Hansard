["<cs> my lords any consideration of the problems which face the bbc today soon reveals a complex situation <e> <s> on the one hand there is <e>", "<cs> my lords we have waited a long time for this bill to reach us today and i know that many believe it over-large and cumbersome <e> <s> when i am asked what it is about i have to reply almost everything <e> <s> it much resembles the elephant of which it has often been remarked it is not easy to describe but somehow you cannot help recognising it when you see it <e> <s> fortunately my only subject today allotments is all neatly and concisely contained in the eight lines of subsection of clause and in the relevant later schedule on page <e>", "<cs> in what appears to be in conclusion i should like to support the noble lord on this amendment <e> <s> i wish to declare my interest as president of the national association of allotment gardeners and i should like also to reassure the committee that the noble lord lord bellwin did write to me and i thank him for his letter <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish at the outset to add my congratulations to the noble lord lord plummer on his maiden speech coupled with the hope that he will draw from the well of experience of his distinguished career often to address your lordships house in the future <e> <s> the terms of the motion for the debate are drawn very simply but while supporting their irrefutable contention that traffic in inner london is getting more congested i cannot agree with the implication that that applies equally to commercial public and private transport <e> <s> my own experience and the data from the supervising bodies which i shall quote shows that some of those categories are increasing some rather steady and others decreasing albeit with a marginal overall increase which is not quite what the motion says <e>", "<cs> my lords while it could hardly fail to contain some good things the bill before us is gravely defective in crucial areas including that of meeting the three main claims made for it by the government <e> <s> i too believe with the last speaker that specifically it does not provide a clear and consistent policy or framework for the payment of subsidies <e> <s> it adds to rather than detracts from legal uncertainty and it discourages rather than promotes efficiency <e> <s> worst of all it appears to move control away from local government and towards central government <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to urge you this evening to support the amendment in the name of the noble baroness lady birk <e> <s> it is not a wrecking amendment and is about the only constructive thing we can do with this objectionable bill at this stage <e> <s> for in or thereabouts the present government promised a searching review and reconstruction of the rating system but they have ducked the issue and now years later have got themselves into a corner to extricate themselves from which they have produced this bill <e> <s> doctors who deal with alcoholism have an expression that all you get if you give strong black coffee to a drunk is a wideawake drunk <e> <s> our rating arrangements in this country are in a state of drunkenness and this bill is the governments strong black coffee <e>", "<cs> my lords the arts council is in the public relations business it is in the business of working with people which requires humility and heaven knows it gets a difficult enough press <e> <s> the title of its strategy for a decade <e>", "<cs> my lords this local government bill is arguably both the most complex and controversial of this session <e> <s> the proposed abolition of the greater london council and the metropolitan counties has aroused enormous opposition among the public professional and voluntary organisations and members of parliament and councillors of all parties many of them from the governments own party <e> <s> the bill has been roundly and uniformly condemned by those people as undemocratic unworkable and likely to lead to increased costs <e> <s> as we have heard this afternoon from the bishops bench in particular there is widespread concern for the prospects of disadvantaged groups as a result of the bill <e>", "<cs> i believe that it may be per cent <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the figures were as follows in january per cent in june per cent and in october per cent <e> <s> i had understood that it was per cent <e> <s> now but if i am wrong i apologise to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> yes that is the case <e>", "<cs> i believe it was per cent <e> <s> but perhaps we have now cleared up that point <e> <s> from this one might deduce that a referendum might not endorse abolition but that could be deceptive <e> <s> in a referendum campaign both sides would have to win over the uncommitted vote for the referendum is a uniquely educative device requiring the citizen to offer a definite opinion upon a specific proposal <e> <s> it is as james bryce noticed <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank all speakers from both sides whatever they have said <e> <s> i shall be brief because i realise that the time is right for dinner <e> <s> i said speakers from both sides and possibly i should have said those down the middle as well because the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter was somewhat down the middle <e> <s> he was much concerned with lines and i can really only draw to mind the well-known motion at the oxford union <e>", "<cs> my lords the needs of inner cities have for a long time been on the political agenda <e> <s> education employment housing traffic deteriorating buildings and community relations are all key issues <e> <s> the government made a post-election pledge to tackle urban decay <e> <s> somehow the words urban decay seem to have come to symbolise all inner city needs rolled into one handy expression <e> <s> urban decay oh yes that is the problem of the inner cities <e> <s> i suppose that it is a handy expression but rather a dry and negative one <e>", "<cs> my lords let me start with the following words <e>", "<cs> my lords there used to be an expression to the effect that <e>", "<cs> my lords to the idealist the european economic community is a most plausible concept as indeed is communism <e> <s> but the reality of life is that someone would always want to be in charge to exercise control and to shape events for their particular interest <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late hour i shall speak solely about the proposed universities funding council the ufc as the bill calls it <e> <s> it is not often that as corporate bodies our ancient universities leave their dreaming spires and dedication to research and teaching to involve themselves in front-line politics <e> <s> when they do so some notice should be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords first i apologise to the house that because of a longstanding commitment outside london i may not be able to attend to the end of the debate <e> <s> secondly i wish to acknowledge a debt to lata the london amenity and transport association as the inspiration for a few of the thoughts that follow <e>", "<cs> my lords in a bill which together with its schedules comprises some words i should like to speak solely to the belief held by many of us that the proposal to sell off the water industry poses serious dangers to the environment an area pithily dealt with some six hours ago by the noble baroness lady stedman <e>", "<cs> this is a cross-party amendment and i urge noble lords of whatever party or no party to support it <e>", "<cs> the purpose of this amendment to which i have put my name is to use the language of solicitors the avoidance of doubt <e> <s> it seeks to specify comprehensively exactly what land and waters are to be conserved so that when the bill leaves parliament and has to be operated by others not close to our debates they will not be left in the unenviable position alas not unknown of saying that it is all very well but parliament did not make clear beyond an iota of doubt what exactly is to be protected <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there is a conflict of interest <e> <s> the control of pollution act permits a fine of for noisy alarms <e> <s> however the vast majority of insurance companies stipulate that alarms may not have a cut-off point because of this situation <e> <s> the intruder goes in sets off the alarm scuttles off to security waits to make sure that nobody goes in and goes back a second time when he knows that no alarm will go off <e> <s> how does the minister see the resolution to this somewhat gordian knot <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the noble lord lord parry on this afternoon enabling us to discuss rural and suburban communities <e> <s> we are importantly but so often invited to discuss inner cities their decay unemployment and transport problems that it is refreshing to escape to the rural suburbs although their position today is perhaps hardly pure sunshine either <e>", "<cs> my lords the terms of this afternoons debate are widely drawn embracing social financial and environmental problems <e> <s> to analyse all of those is rather like peeling an onion revealing successive layers as our debate proceeds <e> <s> our debate was started in excellent fashion by the noble lord mcintosh <e> <s> my layer of the onion is solely the environmental one and a segment of that namely traffic and transport in greater london a subject which has already motivated several speakers <e>", "<cs> my lords two years ago on st may sir richard bayliss of the royal college of physicians wrote in his colleges journal <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to speak solely to the street works section of the bill as outlined in parts iii and iv <e> <s> every bill tends to get a vernacular title and as it were a short title <e> <s> perhaps not surprisingly this one seems to have had the name the potholes bill settled upon it despite its new roads content <e> <s> although it is in some circumstances more agreeable to travel than to arrive it is at present certainly safer to do the latter mainly because of the holes in our roads <e> <s> current diggings are at a level of about million a year although the minister mentioned the figure of million a year <e> <s> as he is the revealer of truth i must accept his higher figure <e> <s> in fact it makes the situation worse <e>"]
