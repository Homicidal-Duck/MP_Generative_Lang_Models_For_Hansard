["<cs> my lords i rise to register a note of dissent and opposition to the bill in particular to certain clauses of it <e> <s> indeed as i listened to the noble lord lord harris of high cross i thought we were going to be entreated to a claim for the total abolition of the trade union movement <e>", "<cs> i too regret having to prolong the committees discussion on this bill and this particular clause <e> <s> like my noble friend lord underhill i have been provoked to intervene because i see this as a layman not as a lawyer <e> <s> i see this too not on the basis of burden of proof but of introducing a new concept in industrial relations that to assess whether an employee is dismissed fairly or unfairly the guiding principle according to the governments proposals will be the size of resources of the business <e> <s> each administration that has come to power in this country in the past decade or so has expressed understandably and feelingly its desire to do something for the low paid in this country <e> <s> if this governments proposals are established in the manner in which they are projected then they will do precisely the opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords at the outset may i ask for the indulgence of the house <e> <s> due to a <e>", "<cs> my lords my intervention in this debate will be very brief simply because many of the things i would want to say have already been said by those who have preceded me <e> <s> may i say at the outset that i welcome this debate despite the fact that it arises from a bill which in my view fails to recognise the full implication to this nation of what the noble earl lord gowrie described as the change in the job market <e> <s> certainly the bill before us makes no real tribute to that change indeed in my view it is a retrograde step that the government are placing before the house in this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords those who have immediately preceded me have been commendably brief <e> <s> i am very conscious of that and shall try to emulate their brevity <e> <s> at the outset i must in speaking <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to make two comments as a preface to my remarks in this contribution to the debate comments based on what i have heard from those who have previously taken part <e> <s> first i totally share the views expressed by the noble baroness lady birk speaking from the front bench on this side of the house and her condemnation of the way in which the british economy <e>", "<cs> i submit my lords that if the noble viscount believes that what i said is nonsense he is living in an entirely different world from the one i live in <e>", "<cs> i do not defend moonlighting my lords and i do not know anyone here who would and therefore to submit that moonlighting is responsible for the ills of the british economy is equally nonsense <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that this debate comes at a time when a growing number of people in our community at large are very restless and seriously concerned about the present strategy being pursued by the government <e> <s> the noble lord lord thorneycroft in a robust way attacked the mover of the motion for staging it in the setting of a debate about over-reliance upon market forces <e> <s> all right if one accepts that may i say in plain simple terms that the debate is about the strategy of the government and the disasters that that strategy is causing <e> <s> that is what is understood outside by the term over-reliance on market forces if it is understood at all <e>", "<cs> my lords may i start by asking your lordships to excuse the fact that i shall not be able to stay until the conclusion of the debate because of a long-standing appointment <e> <s> i intend no discourtesy to the house or particularly to the noble baroness in defence of her bill and what she said about that bill <e> <s> having said that may i say that i personally hope that the government do not look favourably on this bill <e> <s> i think that those who know me will regard my approach to this bill and what i shall say in this debate as marginally different from what i have said previously <e> <s> that i will explain in a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords if i had time i would deal with it <e> <s> i can deal with it privately with the noble lord if he wishes <e> <s> it so happens that when that practice came into operation in glasgow it came into operation against a very difficult economic background <e> <s> it came into being too with a type of agreement different from that at the present time <e> <s> i know that because i sought an endorsement of it on behalf of those who negotiated it so that i know a little background not from what i have read in the papers but from practical experience of what took place at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be an important point to the noble lord lord young of dartington but i do not feel it necessary for me to be distracted by attempting to give the noble lord lord young of dartington the reply that he wishes apart from that which i have already given <e>", "<cs> yes my lords certainly <e>", "<cs> my lords in taking part in this debate i should first like to express my interest in it on two fronts <e> <s> the first is that up to mid- and for many years before that i was privileged to have an organisational representational view of those people who are working in the prescription and service industry of this particular profession <e> <s> and in the knowledge that i know something about the tremendous skill workmanship and above all reliability that is discharged in that function i feel that that is my interest in making what representations i can in opposition to the bill <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am saying that on the evidence of those who have purchased them <e> <s> i quote <e>", "<cs> my lords throughout my public life i have always tried to resist the temptation of the easy option when confronted with problems to blame the other person or in this particular case when looking at the british economy as of now to blame the government <e> <s> i find it very difficult to follow my own standard when making a contribution to the debate this afternoon notwithstanding all the things that have been said in support of the governments strategy by the noble lord lord cockfield <e>", "<cs> my lords i am dealing at the moment with the british economy <e> <s> it is not good enough always to want to pray in aid because of your own incapacity to manage the economy what is happening somewhere else <e> <s> so i would conclude by saying that the stigma which has blighted our society since remains after the budget in the same form as before the budget and is likely to remain so for both the short and the long term <e> <s> it seems to those who are <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to take part in this debate and at the outset i obviously would want to join with those who have preceded me by saying how much i personally enjoyed reading the report of the noble baroness lady seear and her colleagues <e> <s> certainly it is a great deal of food for thought <e> <s> it avoids the ideological dogma that perhaps one is associated with in many other ways <e> <s> i also enjoyed the supplementation of that report which interested me considerably <e> <s> the second point on which i am sure again there will be no controversy is to say as others have done how much i enjoyed the maiden speech of the noble baroness lady carnegy with its depth of information and statistical detail born out of experience of dealing with manpower problems <e> <s> i do not suppose there could have been a more fitting association of a maiden speech with the subject matter that has been under examination here this afternoon and this evening <e>", "<cs> may i as a preamble to my short statement on this second reading debate say that unfortunately i shall not be able to stay to the conclusion of the debate because for family reasons i have to return to manchester this evening <e> <s> i hope that the house will forgive me for not being able to stay <e> <s> i like my noble friend lord taylor of mansfield listened with great interest to the noble earl lord gowrie and his presentation and defence of the governments bill <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble earl is not in his place at the moment because i wanted to make what i regard and he may regard too as a pertinent comment about his presentation <e> <s> he described the bill among other things as the governments most significant achievement <e> <s> i wonder whether on reflection he and others who believe that might prefer to leave the judgment to the historians <e> <s> for my part i am prepared to <e> <s> i do not see it in the light in which it was described by the noble earl and i am sure that there are many thousands of people in the united kingdom today who take a similar view <e>"]
