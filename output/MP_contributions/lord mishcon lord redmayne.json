["<cs> before the noble lord embarks upon his argument i wonder whether i may say something about the practical aspect of the debate <e> <s> i sympathise with noble lords opposite in trying to make the most of a very good political occasion but i wonder whether they realise that the amount of parliamentary time available to the government in this session is very limited <e> <s> at the most there are practical days or perhaps right to the end of the session and if noble lords succeeded in overloading the bill by putting in more contentious matter that would simply lead to a situation in which in the end the bill would fall <e> <s> i do not think that anybody would greatly worry in that it can all be put into the bill but it seems to me that noble lords opposite are playing the game rather unwisely <e> <s> the bill seems to be a long way away <e> <s> i take it that that bill will be included in the queens speech which is within or parliamentary days <e>"]
