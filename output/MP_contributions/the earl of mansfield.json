["<cs> my lords if i may begin this winding-up on a personal note may i express my thanks to those noble lords who expressed some satisfaction at seeing me in this spot <e> <s> of course any idea that i might have had that there would be a general if reluctant measure of agreement among your lordships for this motion this afternoon was rudely dissipated by the noble and learned lord lord kilbrandon who in fact has stated his intention of hopefully urging this house to exercise its undoubted constitutional right of defying the terms of the scotland act which were written into it and disregarding whatever views the other place may have had on this particular motion <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect to the noble and learned lord i am glad that he now takes the stance that he does <e> <s> it saves me the task of trying to persuade him not to take that course <e> <s> it was to be expected that the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey would express regret if i may use the analogy for the last time that his baby had come to an untimely end <e> <s> however i could not help but notice that in effect he admitted that the scotland act as it was passed had imperfections <e> <s> i think he said that it was the best measure that could be devise in the circumstances <e> <s> he said as did other noble lords that perhaps if it remained on the statute book it could be improved subsequently in the light of experience <e>", "<cs> certainly my lords but there is no desire on the part of the government to close options <e> <s> if the parties wish to revive the idea of some form of inquisitorial body i am sure it can be discussed it is just that at the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin on a personal note by thanking the noble lord lord hughes very much for his kind remarks <e> <s> he sat in this position if i may so call it for longer than most with great distinction and he knows precisely what the job entails <e> <s> of course the noble lord perpetuates the popular myth that lawyers of any sort can deal with anything <e> <s> however let me tell him that it is no asset in my particular circumstances to be a lawyer because i am a lawyer in the wrong country <e> <s> therefore the language is even worse than it would otherwise be and i start in fact from a subordinate position <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but so far as jurymen and their refreshment is concerned it is very important that we should get it right <e> <s> having said that i am glad that this large and somewhat cumbersome but nevertheless useful bill apparently commends itself to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords even though i am an english barrister i would not say that the criminal law of england is perfect <e> <s> however i shall bring my noble friends observation to the attention of my right honourable friend and point out to him that it appears that in certain directions the law of scotland has now advanced further and in a better direction than that of england <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for that expression of support <e> <s> my name is on the back of the bill and if any blame is to be taken i quite cheerfully take it on my shoulders <e> <s> i am equally conscious that the noble lord has kindly said that he wishes to see economies of printing <e>", "<cs> as the noble and learned lord well knows i am in the wrong country here <e> <s> all i can do is to take counsel on the matter if i may be permitted to use the phrase and thereafter write to him and if he disagrees with what has been proposed no doubt he can take it up at a later stage in the bill <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble and learned lord for those remarks <e> <s> there is one sitting among us who will be well seized of what is behind the noble and learned lords remarks and i will consider the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends question falls into two parts first what i might call the domestic front that is the taking of salmon in the sea not so far from our coasts <e> <s> the whole question of salmon protection is currently under review <e> <s> in the meantime the fisheries departments are seeking to <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is referring to mono-filament nets but better scientific evidence of the effect of these nets is needed <e> <s> the question is being kept under review <e>", "<cs> yes my lords this is the international part of the reply which i was attempting to make to the supplementary question of my noble friend lord balfour of inchrye <e> <s> there are two parts <e> <s> there is the domestic salmon protection and also international measures <e> <s> it is these which at the moment the government are considering in the light of various proposals made by the united states government <e>", "<cs> my lords we have our differences with the danes over various fishing matters but i think that it is right to say that there has been considerable co-operation between her majestys government and the danish government for some considerable time as to the fishing off greenland <e> <s> but i agree with my noble friend that this is not a question that we can ever put aside <e>", "<cs> my lords if legislation putting right defects which are almost invariably the fault of clergymen or officials can be said to be anything but beneficial yes my lords it is <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that the amendment is without prejudice to subsection of section of the act which in itself makes the solemnisation of a marriage in certain circumstances an offence <e> <s> what these amendments do is to validate a situation which might exist through no fault of the parties but through <e>", "<cs> my lords whether the noble and learned lord is <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey for his muted but nevertheless genuine welcome for this modest measure <e> <s> i detected in his speech a great many references to what we know or hope will be a forthcoming criminal justice bill <e> <s> i am the first to sympathise with his very natural apprehension and i must be careful with my metaphors here that the legal child which he conceived is to be brought forth possibly in a form which may be slightly or even materially different from what he thought it might be <e> <s> i do not propose to say any more about the criminal justice bill the noble and learned lord must contain himself until it sees the light of day <e> <s> i am aware that he has put down a question for written answer and that will be answered as expeditiously and as compendiously as possible but i repeat that we must wait until the bill sees the light of day before we can draw our conclusions <e>", "<cs> my lords even i as an honorary sheriff made a mistake once i believe but it was put right on appeal and there are full rights of appeal in this bill which persons who find themselves in such unfortunate circumstances can invoke and pray in aid <e> <s> as to the point which the noble and learned lord made about my noble and learned friend the lord advocate may i say that he is reserving his power for just such an occasion as the criminal justice bill when i for one shall be very glad of a -pounder alongside me <e>", "<cs> no my lords scottish courts sit on nd january so is going to be all right <e> <s> what i want to say is this that the whole point of clause of this bill in other words interim liberation a splendid word that <e> <s> by the police is designed for just this sort of occasion <e> <s> that is to say where it <e>", "<cs> i have a certain sympathy with the noble and learned lord in that one always wants to keep statutes to their shortest to make every word meaningful as it were and not to introduce unnecessary verbiage <e> <s> i concede at once that this bill would not fall if the words which form the subject of amendment no <e> <s> were excluded nor could i say that that would in any way make the bill less able to be comprehensively understood by those who sought to read it <e>", "<cs> when i was musing if that is the right word upon the noble and learned lord and his amendments i rather wondered whether these two might have been pleaded in the alternative but i gather that they are not <e> <s> much of what i said about the noble and learned lords previous amendment is right so far as this amendment is concerned <e> <s> i am not going to repeat myself <e> <s> i am certainly not going to repeat myself about the criminal justice scotland bill and i promise not to do so although when that measure eventually sees the light of day in your lordships house i fear that we shall have to return to it <e> <s> when i say that i have no wish at all to twist the noble and learned lords tail <e>", "<cs> this amendment is really a follower if i may so call it of the other two which the noble and learned lord has moved and withdrawn <e> <s> it is slightly stronger than the others because as he points out the word special in clause <e>", "<cs> my understanding is that this was indeed the only way that one could do it <e>", "<cs> i had rather thought that the noble and learned lord was going to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and together but he has chosen not to do so and that is his choice <e> <s> if amendment no <e> <s> were successful then i fully agree that the word necessary would need to be replaced otherwise it would be tautologous <e> <s> however if one takes the meaning of the word necessary in this particular circumstance it is i suggest by definition a phrase which in effect means the only appropriate course <e> <s> if one wishes to use the word appropriate it puts it to my mind at any rate on a lower plane of necessity than what is written into this clause <e>", "<cs> i apologise if the impression that i have given is that the noble and learned lord thinks that i do not understand his amendment <e> <s> let us look at it again <e> <s> what does clause <e>", "<cs> as i understand the effect of amendment no <e> <s> it would mean in fact that a court or indeed the lord advocate would be prevented from requiring a deposit of money unless it was satisfied that this was the only course appropriate to the special circumstances of the case and moreover the accused person agreed to this requirement <e> <s> it is not either/or both conditions would have to he fulfilled <e> <s> what one asks oneself would happen if the accused refused to agree <e> <s> under the amendment the accused could withhold his consent and therefore by withholding his consent he could prevent the court from requiring a deposit of money as a condition of bail <e>", "<cs> i think the noble and learned lord is descending a little from his previously high plateau of logic <e> <s> in the first place i would remind him that the average bail demanded in scottish courts is between and so we are jumping quite considerably into the range <e>", "<cs> no of course it does not but those are people who are not going to be worried by this question of consent <e> <s> the owner of a foreign trawler wants to get on with his <e>", "<cs> i suppose one could say that in scotland crime does not pay <e>", "<cs> first i should like to add my words of congratulation to my noble and learned friend lord mackay of clashfern on if one may so call it his maiden speech <e> <s> no doubt he may have expected to make such a speech on what i might call a full parliamentary occasion with the galleries crammed and the benches behind him also full <e> <s> nevertheless as a lawyer perhaps it is more appropriate that he should make his first contribution in the parliamentary workhouse <e> <s> i have a faint feeling of resentment that no sooner do the two scottish advocates get together than all becomes lovey-dovey and the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey immediately falls backwards and says oh i shall not move my amendments i am very content with yours <e> <s> however when i get to my feet we find ourselves again in realms of contention i am afraid that that is how it has to be <e>", "<cs> i wish to comment first on what the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran regaled the committee with <e> <s> we are talking in the main not about offenders but about people who are released pending their trial and what we are going to do with them as a community if they fail to turn up <e> <s> this is the measure which the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey has seen fit to try to amend <e> <s> i do not say that rudely but that is the point of the amendment to reduce the sentence which can be imposed on someone who fails to turn up at his trial from two years to six months <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble and learned lord will permit me to intervene at this stage <e> <s> i do so on a matter of information which may contribute to his knowledge <e> <s> i am informed that under the criminal procedure act two years is the maximum sentence of imprisonment available to sheriffs in solemn court for common law offences <e> <s> so the issues do in fact hang together do they not <e>", "<cs> i very much hope that it does not <e> <s> i have a very high regard for our scottish police <e> <s> i have not seen them professionally in the sense that the noble and learned lord has but i was a member of my local authority until it was reorganised and i was on the police committee <e> <s> in my fairly humble judicial sphere i have also had a lot of dealings with the police <e> <s> i think that with the guidelines which my <e>", "<cs> i have a certain sympathy with what the noble and learned lord is trying to achieve with this amendment but for reasons to which i shall come i regret that i cannot accept it <e> <s> the effect of the amendment would be to require a court to be held at least once in the three days when it would not otherwise be sitting because the court holiday falls immediately before or after a weekend <e> <s> first i would stress that the police in future will be encouraged and enabled to release people more rapidly over a wider range of offences <e> <s> my noble and learned friend intends to issue what i might describe as guidelines which were discussed in the other place and to which i can draw the attention of the house if necessary <e> <s> as a result fewer people should be held in custody in future before their first appearance in court <e> <s> the police as noble lords will know work closely with the fiscal when considering the release of an accused and the fiscals recommendation weighs very heavily with sheriffs when bail is being considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to say that i am inal most complete agreement with the noble and learned lord as to the intrinsic desirability of his new clause <e> <s> as he i think appreciates this is not the place for it <e> <s> the reform is as dear to my heart as to the noble and learned lords but alas <e> <s> i am advised that it is incompatible with the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord moved his amendment in terms which were commendably brief <e> <s> as he wants to know <e>", "<cs> my lords i am at one with the noble and learned lord in his desire to as it were guide the courts into the position where they impose a requirement to deposit money as a condition of release only in the very small number of cases where this is appropriate <e> <s> nevertheless i cannot support his amendment because i do not think it is as felicitously worded as perhaps he thinks <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose that it falls to me to congratulate the noble lord on what i imagine to be his first speech from the opposition front bench <e> <s> the compendiousness of my answer would have been a good deal greater if he had actually told me that on these somewhat esoteric matters he wanted to attract the attention of your lordships <e> <s> the position as i understand it is that the responsibility for the control of dogs and if one looks at the schedule to the bill one can see how it is designed and how it is set out is in effect passing from the police to the district councils <e> <s> one can see the various powers which under the dogs act are now to be vested in the district council <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i really doubt whether the noble lord is in order with these persistent questions <e> <s> perhaps i may be permitted to write to the noble lord with the information which he seeks <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be churlish of me not to thank the noble lord for his kind remarks <e> <s> his noble and learned friend used approximately the same words at the end of the report stage of the bill and i could not think then of a way of reciprocating <e> <s> however i would ask the noble lord to pass on to him the thanks of my noble and learned friend and myself for the constructive way in which he approached the bill when it was before your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may interrupt the noble and learned lord to repeat what i did say that unless the police arrest they have no power to search <e>", "<cs> no my lords i said a noble lord sitting behind the noble lord lord peart <e> <s> the noble lord was in the same geographical position as the noble earl but it was not in fact the noble earl <e>", "<cs> just to clear up a possible doubt i believe that the noble lord lord foot said at the opening of his remarks that he was not speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> may i preface my remarks on these amendments by saying that i have found this an interesting and fascinating debate in which your <e>", "<cs> this is the give a dog a bad name point if i am not mistaken <e> <s> i will certainly look at that <e>", "<cs> the first amendment spoken to by the noble lord lord foot that is to say amendment no <e> <s> would impose an absolute limit of half an hour on the time a suspect may be required to remain with a constable for the noting and verification of his name and address or for the noting of any explanation proffered <e> <s> i deliberately use the word suspect because of the undertaking i have given and we can leave potential witnesses out of it for the purposes of this debate <e> <s> the present proviso is that the requirement to remain with the constable <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly have another look <e> <s> i do not hold out any undertaking to the noble lord on this <e> <s> i think that as far as unreasonable delay is concerned it is an objective test <e> <s> unreasonable delay in all the circumstances is to be the test to be applied <e> <s> i should have thought that that was a sensible way of reading the clause but i shall look at it <e>", "<cs> there is a happy harmony for the moment so far as i am concerned with the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey in that i too am exercising my mind as to whether it is necessary to make a specific provision in the bill <e> <s> i am quick to say that i have some sympathy with the intention of this amendment particularly as it is on a recommendation of the thomson report <e>", "<cs> in this context of course any maximum period specified must inevitably appear somewhat arbitrary and as has now been said by both the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey and my noble friend lord kinross this in fact follows the recommendation of the thomson committee <e> <s> they gave careful consideration to the evidence they received on this matter and i should like to quote from the report because this is a very important part of the bill and it is also a part of the bill about which some indignation has been expressed in some quarters <e> <s> the report said on page paragraph <e>", "<cs> it may shorten the deliberation of your lordships if at tins stage i tell the committee what is the governments attitude to the view behind the amendment <e> <s> i have a great deal of sympathy with the views expressed <e> <s> as to the amendment moved by the noble and learned lord lord fraser i would say only this <e> <s> his amendment would delete subsection which did not appear at all in the last governments bill and the purpose of that subsection is to prevent the re-detention of suspects except as it is written on the authority of a justice <e> <s> without it the police could legally detain a suspect for an infinity of six-hour periods <e> <s> this is quite unacceptable to the government and i hope to most noble lords <e> <s> therefore i would ask the noble and learned lord to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> i really cannot take any criticism from the noble and learned lord so far as his allegation of tardiness in respect of the government is concerned <e> <s> when the bill was given a second reading in your lordships house the government were accused of south african tendencies which i found a little bitter <e> <s> as soon as we come to that stage of the bill when amendments are expected to be made and i stop the debate and say that the government are willing to make changes to the bill even then i am criticised <e> <s> so there is nothing that i can do to please the noble and learned lord and i think that i shall stop trying <e> <s> having said that my undertaking was meant to include the matters which they obviously wished to raise in the amendment which was tabled by the noble and learned lord and the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e>", "<cs> in relation to the drafting point mentioned by the noble lord lord foot it is one which has been observed and will be rectified at a later stage but for good or ill i have decided not to table such amendments at this stage <e>", "<cs> the effect of clause is to allow a constable first of all to question the suspect secondly to search him and thirdly to take his fingerprints while he is detained at a police station <e> <s> as i understand the amendment what the noble and learned lord objects to is the fingerprinting part of the process on the basis that it is an unjustified interference with civil liberty <e> <s> i do not altogether follow the logic <e> <s> if somebody is going to be questioned and searched i should have thought that his civil liberties had to a degree been interfered with and that i think we are all agreed is a necessary power for the police <e>", "<cs> i said teeth and feet <e>", "<cs> this has been a wide-ranging and not unentertaining debate <e> <s> if i needed any convincing on a personal level that tape recorders were probably not altogether satisfactory this debate would have done just that <e> <s> i wonder whether i may take the committee back to the amendment and most importantly to clause because i do not think that all noble lords are fully aware of what it actually provides <e> <s> what i can say is that the amendment would give immediate effect to the recommendation of the thomson committee that the interrogation of suspects in police stations must be recorded and would make it virtually impossible to bring this clause into operation until installation of equipment had taken place in every police station <e> <s> that is the first point <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord in the full flow of his peroration but old bailey arguments really do not obtain in scotland where it is quite a rare occurrence to have that sort of trial within a trial <e> <s> i think the noble lords vast experience is not wholly applicable north of the border <e>", "<cs> this has been a fascinating mini-debate but if i may say so i think that we are in danger of reading into this clause what is not there <e> <s> if i may deal first with what was said by the noble lord lord ross of marnock whatever troubles he had with his honourable friend over the matter of drunken driving and whether there should be spot checks with breathalysers nobody is suggesting that there should be spot checks for offensive weapons <e> <s> if i may draw his attention to the first part of the clause it says <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey i do not suppose will be very surprised if i tell him that i am unable to support his amendment <e> <s> although there has been a certain amount of modest heat in our debate and i have no complaint about that the government at any rate do not regard the provisions contained in clauses to as what i might term dramatic innovations <e> <s> the noble and learned lord said that the powers taken now are significantly greater than they were in the bill published by the last government <e> <s> that of course is a subjective matter of opinion but at any rate we rather regard these measures as designed to regulate existing practices and we do not believe that any useful purpose would be served by providing for a review of their operation <e> <s> indeed one can say that a provision for a review might be positively unhelpful <e>", "<cs> i was not here years ago <e>", "<cs> i have been taking counsel through the usual channels and so on and in a way it is difficult for me to put an estimate on how long our labours are likely to take on any particular stage of this bill <e> <s> but we have been getting on very slowly if i may say so <e> <s> i would not dream of blaming any noble lord for that they are important matters that we have been discussing <e> <s> i think the feelings of my noble and learned friend and me are that we should continue for another clause or two anyway <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now considered on report <e>", "<cs> my lords i must thank the noble lord at least for his preliminary observations which were a form of thanks <e> <s> in my letter to the noble lord i tried to point out why it was that in the present circumstances it is not possible for the government to deal with this as opposed to the local authorities themselves promoting private bills <e> <s> perhaps when we can get <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the inhabitants of barra will welcome as indeed i do the support of the noble lord to this measure and indeed the support of the government for the highlands and islands development board which i have vouchsafed in public on a great number of occasions <e> <s> as the noble lord has said or at any rate implied this is a private bill which is not directly sponsored by the government therefore i shall be perfectly frank with the noble lord <e> <s> without prior notice i am not briefed to answer technical questions on matters such as estimates and all i can do as i think i did on a <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will get his information as soon as it can come with a p stanp <e>", "<cs> i have listened with the very greatest care and attention to what the noble and learned lord lord fraser of tullyhelton and other noble lords have said <e> <s> if i may respectfully agree with the noble and learned lord lord keith of kinkel there are overtones to this part of the bill which go beyond the law and come into the general policy of the administration of justice <e> <s> when if i may call them such representatives of those upon whom this duty is being put say that it is not a duty which they welcome naturally one pays the greatest attention to what they say <e> <s> however as the noble and learned lord pointed out this clause of the bill comes from the recommendations of the committee presided over by lord emslie <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i could say a word about this <e> <s> my noble friend lord teviot produced an amendment which my noble friend lord lyell said would in fact not achieve the ends that he wanted and with respect my noble friend is perfectly entitled to say that <e> <s> naturally before the next stage of this bill we shall examine the matter to see whether the dissemination of what will in fact be new rules of conduct for operators of these coaches which is no doubt a laudable aim can be improved beyond what my noble friend has said but i really do not think that my noble friend has much if any cause for complaint when my other noble friend gives that undertaking <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could refer the noble lord lord mishcon to clause which says that this bill extends to scotland only so that the complications of putting a rgime if i may so call it on british rail is not going to be easy <e> <s> having said that i will give the undertaking that the noble lord requests and in turn request that my noble friend withdraws his amendment <e>", "<cs> at this hour i should like to compress my remarks and indeed i shall do so but i am afraid <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is wrong <e> <s> for the sake of the record perhaps i should put it right <e> <s> most offences involving vandalism will be taken by way of summary procedure <e> <s> it <e>", "<cs> yes i will certainly give that undertaking <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may reply very briefly <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross made the point that to him at any rate the amendment gives more power to the individual police officer who comes across a situation and is expected to deal with it <e> <s> i think that he mentioned the phrase subjective test <e> <s> of course inevitably the test must be subjective whether one takes the clause as originally drafted or as it is under the amendment which i have moved <e> <s> the duty upon the officer is now not to exercise his power unless it appears that verification can be obtained quickly and i should have thought that means in plain english that the boot is now on the other foot <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be helpful if i intervene at this stage because the noble lord may be pleased to know that he is pushing at an open door <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for having put forward this amendment <e> <s> if your lordships look at the marshalled list you will find that the amendment is starred i do not say that in any sense of reproach but the fact that it is so recent has meant that the draftsmen have not been able to give the amendment quite the consideration which they would like <e> <s> therefore i am not now in a position to accept the amendment because there are doubts and difficulties about the quality of the draftsmanship <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that too matters here and again i am diffident about giving this sort of reply except that i have the consolation that when the moment comes sheriffs and indeed judges will look at the statute and not at <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that is right <e> <s> will the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor put the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise i am totally out of order <e> <s> i invited the noble lord lord foot to withdraw his amendment and he has not done it <e>", "<cs> my lords i take considerable comfort from what the noble lord lord foot has said <e> <s> in fact to a degree he shot my fox <e> <s> between committee and this stage we gave considerable thought to the position of witnesses under this clause <e> <s> i think we <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank both noble lords for their kindly acceptance of the amendment particularly in relation to what the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords a number of different consequences may follow if a police officer takes someone into custody under clause of the bill <e> <s> i should like to take the detention part of the question first <e> <s> i do not suppose <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i can answer that point <e> <s> my noble friend with respect is not comparing like with like <e> <s> in breathalyser cases something untoward might occur at the beginning of procedures and it might be held for instance that police officers not in uniform were not authorised to administer the breathalyser test <e> <s> the entire course of the trial and subsequent conviction is then vitiated <e> <s> many extremely tortuous points have been raised in such instances by defence advocates particularly in the english courts i raised a few myself in my time and they have resulted in triumph and acquittal for the client <e> <s> however here we are talking about something entirely different we are concerned with the power of detention under clause of the bill <e> <s> my noble friend will see that we are concerned not with part of the offence or the trial but with a stage at which the police are given in certain circumstances a right of detention which they do not have at the moment <e> <s> we debated this at very considerable length both at second reading and in committee and it is a matter which the government seek to have regularised in statutory form <e>", "<cs> my lords may i by leave address the house again and in all humility remind your lordships that this is the report stage not the committee stage <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> as i have already said twice the overriding principle in all scottish trials is the matter of fairness <e> <s> if the procurator fiscal or the judge was convinced that what had or had not happened in the street made the matter unfair i have no doubt that that would be reflected in the result of the trial if there was one <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not really going to speak to amendment no <e> <s> although i take the noble lords point that his reasons are very similar <e> <s> i do not think i can really go very much further than i have gone <e> <s> i think one must start from the premise that the police are likely to do what they are required to do in the interests of the detained person in the proper form and there is really no reason why they should not <e> <s> they are versed in the procedures already and one hopes and indeed one expects that they will go through these procedures in the right way and in the right order <e> <s> one has to ask oneself what is gained by the signature of the detainee at the foot of the form <e> <s> if he agrees subsequently with what happened in other words if he agrees that his rights were pointed out to him and that everything happened fairly and properly then he will not worry as to the record and what has been put upon it <e> <s> if he does not agree if he says he was treated harshly or that the police acted unfairly or failed to go through the proper procedures then as i have tried to point out the fact that his signature appears at the foot of the form will not entitle any court to say ah <e> <s> yes but you have signed the form although no doubt it would be put to him because as i have said he would merely say that he was intimidated and told that he would not be bailed for instance until he did sign it <e> <s> for all these reasons and i have reiterated them <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> he is entitled to quote verbatim from members of the government <e> <s> perhaps i may suggest that he does so in order that we get it right <e> <s> i hope he will not take that as an offensive request <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord foot said in his opening remarks we did discuss this amendment fairly exhaustively in committee and i certainly do not want to go over all the ground i went over on that occasion when i dealt with for instance such matters as the noble lord lord mishcon raised as to the cost of the apparatus in question which has to be designed in such a way that in fact it becomes an extremely expensive piece of electronic apparatus <e> <s> i really do not want to go over that ground again not only for that reason but also because i really do not think that we need to do so <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am not saying anything of the sort <e> <s> what i am saying to your lordships is that what the committee said is not holy writ and what has been discovered is that if this experiment is to provide the safeguards we all require and an exact rendering and reproduction of a conversation in a way which i described in committee as <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i have already explained why we do not wish to accede to the suggestion that the police should be required by statute to invite the suspect to sign the record <e> <s> i am afraid that i do not see any value in requiring them to record the terms in which the suspect is informed or indeed the suspects reply <e> <s> i cannot see any reason to suppose that the police would fail to give the information in the proper terms <e> <s> they are experienced and well versed in these procedures <e> <s> the suspects response in such circumstances is unlikely to be either significant or helpful <e> <s> if it were i am sure that the police would record it anyway <e>", "<cs> my lords i am bound to say that i am rather attracted by the noble lords proposals both in this amendment and in amendment no <e> <s> b <e> <s> i am attracted by the idea that a person being detained should be entitled to know whether the police delay in notifying his solicitor or his friend and if there has to be delay one would expect to see the time of that delay recorded <e> <s> what i propose to do is to undertake to consider the matter and if i may consult with colleagues with a view to considering the possibility of bringing forward an appropriate amendment in another place <e> <s> i will not go further than that but on that undertaking perhaps the noble lord will consider withdrawing this amendment and possibly not moving the next <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the noble lords point and i particularly do not want at this moment to address myself as to whether clause should be in the bill at all because i dare say noble lords will have something to say about that when we come to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> all i was saying was that these amendments which are of a drafting nature are also explanatory in that they make plain the intention of the section as it will become <e> <s> as i have tried to point out to your lordships they make plain what the noble and learned lord lord wheatley in committee said was not plain at any rate to him <e> <s> the government have considered what the noble and learned lord said respectfully agreed with him and tabled these amendments in order to clear up the position <e> <s> they really do not go any further than that and i do not think i can either <e>", "<cs> my lords with the greatest respect to the noble lord if he will give way one is expected to speak only once on report in your lordships house <e> <s> far be it from me to point out his duty to the noble lord but this is the report stage and possibly the noble lord may wish to reflect on his position <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly think about it but if i may say so i think the clause is perfectly plain in its meaning and to put words in unnecessarily would be surplusage <e>", "<cs> my lords there was a good deal of discussion on this clause in committee and i do not propose to repeat all the arguments in favour of it which i deployed on that occasion <e> <s> however i take comfort from what was said then by the noble and learned lord lord wheatley who has vast experience in these matters <e> <s> equally i take comfort from the remarks of my noble friends who support the inclusion of this clause in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords we discussed at committee stage a very similar new clause to this one <e> <s> the only difference is that noble lords have now lengthened the proposed trial period from three years to five years <e> <s> neither the noble lord lord ross of marnock nor the noble lord lord mishcon sought to explain why the period should be lengthened from three years to five years <e> <s> i do not take any point on that mostly because i do not agree and the government do not agree with the concept of a review in these circumstances <e> <s> may <e>", "<cs> my lords as has already been said the matters which have been the subject of this debate have all been fairly comprehensively covered during the committee stage <e> <s> i had not wished nor indeed intended again to go over the ground which has already been covered very thoroughly <e> <s> however in view of the very considerable interest which this matter has aroused in your lordships house at what is a late hour and in view of the very considerable attendance there now is in the chamber and bearing in mind the very persuasive arguments not least those which the two noble and learned lords have presented i think it is incumbent on me both to try to justify the decision which the government made in including this provision in the bill and to seek to persuade the house as i hope i shall that this is a desirable reform <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no one who can make a bad point better than the noble lord can and long may he be with us to do it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not going to do so <e> <s> it is hearsay evidence and i do not think it would be right of me to regale the house with whatever the lord justice-general may or may not have said in conversations and i do not know whether they were private and i do not know the circumstances in which they took place with my noble and learned friend <e> <s> i do not think the house would expect me to deal with that sort of conversation <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to that is yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i have given my answer to that and i am afraid that i cannot go further than what i have already said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sufficiently informed to be able to make a creditable and comprehensive reply on behalf of the government <e> <s> if i attempted to do so it would be not right of me <e> <s> the noble lord may shake his head and he may make of it what he likes <e> <s> but i am not in a position to give an account of whatever conversations have taken place on this matter <e>", "<cs> i can only go on my lords <e> <s> what i had come to in effect was an attempt to justify the making mandatory except in exceptional circumstances of what has always been since the death sentence was abolished a discretionary power <e> <s> acting as i have said the government have on the report of this committee they now seek to make the power mandatory except in exceptional circumstances and i now come to the point which was put to me as to when exceptional circumstances come about <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords my recollection is and i have not been able to look it up in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always ready to look <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> does he know how far it is from tynecastle to murrayfield <e> <s> would he agree with me that it is about yards and that the supporters might be expected to walk between the two <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has had his point explained perfectly adequately by my noble friend lord lyell <e> <s> as regards the present situation no further powers are required in relation to railway police <e> <s> that is my first point <e> <s> my second point is that various departments are as it were in consultation <e> <s> i do not think that my noble friend can go further than say as he has that the object of the exercise is to bring forth a by-law which will i hope be comprehensive and commendable <e> <s> it would be quite impossible for any of us to say at this stage how long it will take the draftsmen to put the thoughts on to paper and thereafter to produce a satisfactory by-law <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey i shall address myself only to the two amendments nos <e> <s> and at this stage <e> <s> when i saw the list of amendments to start with i formed the unworthy thought that perhaps the noble and learned lord lord wilson of lang-side was trying as it were to have his cake and eat it <e> <s> but i am sure that cannot be so and i therefore discuss these two amendments on the basis that he is a sinner come to repentance that the wise words which fell from my lips in committee when we discussed this matter at considerable length have had their effect on the noble and learned lord as well as the various researches which he has obviously made and which i shall not deal with at any further length and i discuss these two amendments on their merits <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give the noble and learned lord that assurance now <e> <s> the word replaced should be taken as having its normal english meaning or what i consider to be its normal english meaning <e> <s> there is no question of repealing or replacing in the other sense any of the existing common law <e>", "<cs> my lords i must congratulate noble lords opposite on having done their homework <e> <s> some went back quite a long way <e> <s> to deal with the noble and learned lord who has gone back least far if i am guilty of misleading the house in relation to the reply i gave to the noble lord lord mishcon i crave <e>", "<cs> my lords i am bound to say i do not know whether it was a cockney who actually drafted this <e> <s> i do not think we have many in the scottish office but i will look up this point <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend not only has expertisehe has experience and if he confesses that he is either perplexed or even worse bemused who am i to contradict him <e> <s> i do not know whether the effect of my noble friends remarks was what i might call a <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> this is a matter which the draftsmen will have to consider in the light of my noble friends remarks <e> <s> i am certainly not competent to deal with it at this moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly take very seriously the constructive remarks of my noble friend <e> <s> of course other departments have different ways of going about matters but so far as the scottish office is concerned when we have any bill like this again i am sure that something on the lines that my noble friend has suggested will be more than welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall bring to my right honourable friends attention my noble friends request that he should himself pay a visit <e> <s> perhaps i may say with regard to the alternative site at tweedbank that there is insufficient land available there for a major hospital project <e>

growth in the longer term <e> <s> the fact that the site which has been chosen is in an area designated as of great landscape value does not of course preclude development <e> <s> great care has been taken over the positioning and the design of buildings within the site <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the scheme is not yet under way in the physical sense <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give my noble friend that assurance <e> <s> the views of the commission have already been considered by the local authorities concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not armed with that information <e> <s>

think <e> <s> perhaps <e>", "<cs> with the indulgence of the committee i will answer because my noble friend was good enough to tell me about it and i had it looked up <e> <s> section of the education milk act limits an authoritys power to provide milk for children at non-maintained schools to children at special schools and to other children under eight years <e> <s> clause of the bill simply removes that limitation restoring the position to that in section of the act as amended leaving authorities free to supply milk meals and so on to non-maintained schools as they think appropriate <e> <s> there is at present no duty to provide milk at non-maintained special schools <e> <s> the power of authorities to do so is not affected by this clause so that the words which the amendment proposed to leave out are in any case only consequential on the substance of the provision in the preceding words of the subsection <e> <s> i hope that meets his point <e>", "<cs> i shall not follow the noble lord lord ross down the highways and byways of the highlands and islands but <e>", "<cs> stick to a pre-breakfast remark or two <e> <s> i start with this premise that we on this side consider that it is indefensible in the present economic situation to spend hundreds of millions of pounds on a subsidy to school meals most of which goes to families who are in no need of such a subsidy <e> <s> if i may come from that straight to scotland the low demand for school meals in scotland shows that the present type of meal is far from popular and is unwanted <e> <s> fewer than half of the pupils presently take the meal at all and fewer than one-third are prepared to pay for it <e> <s> on the other hand there is evidence of an unsatisfied demand especially in secondary schools for a more informal type of snack school meal such as is proposed in the bill <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord lord galpern does not understand why there is need for economy in this country far be it from me to turn this into an economic debate <e> <s> of course there will be economies made and in a moment i shall come to the scale of them <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has made an intervention <e> <s> he will have the right to speak in a few minutes and no doubt will do so and tear me to pieces <e> <s> the next matter relates to the difference in the dependence of rural families on school transport in comparison with their counterparts in the urban areas <e> <s> again there has been a certain amount of misunderstanding <e> <s> on friday my noble friend the duke of norfolk spoke on the radio programme today day when normally i have the sod of scotland under my feet but because i was working this bill was unable to do so <e> <s> the noble duke said in effect that urban people do not have to pay anything at all <e> <s> many speakers in this debate have exposed the fallacy of that point of view <e> <s> in some cases they may have to pay very much more than the urban dweller <e> <s> therefore the reality is rather different <e>", "<cs> unless they arc travelling to a designated football ground i do not think that whisky comes into the matter <e> <s> we have had quite enough of that <e> <s> whisky or no i do not believe especially in a rural community and in the rural community that i inhabit that a harsh and unconscionable view will be taken of a child who does not have his money or his pass <e> <s> my noble friend lord ridley spoke i was about to say from the grassroots of the local authorities but to say that would be very rude he spoke from the pinnacle of the local authorities <e> <s> the local authorities will no doubt give guidance to the operators on how such matters arc to be dealt with and i should have thought we could have left that to their good sense <e>", "<cs> if i may interrupt the noble viscount it will be appreciated that because of the intervening amendment i could not rise to my feet <e> <s> it had to be dealt with <e> <s> the committee have clearly come to a decision as to what they consider to be right and proper so far as the last clause dealing with the question of school transport was concerned <e> <s> in the circumstances and one rejoices if one may that the house of lords is able to take an independent view of the government of the day the government do not think that it would be either profitable or proper to continue the debate on that part of the bill which applies to scotland <e> <s> i suggest therefore that the matter is now put <e> <s> perhaps the noble viscount and others who had given notice of their intention to move amendments would not do so <e> <s> we can then come to the end of the clause <e>", "<cs> since the noble lord lord ross of marnock has intimated that he does not intend to divide the committee on this matter i can leave out of my speech some of the more ebullient remarks to which i might have given vent but they will come again they will keep <e> <s> i confirm what the noble lord has said in scotland the law has been widely understood and perfectly appreciated by the local authorities and i believe that the figures speak for themselves in this matter as to the seriousness with which they have considered and sought to carry out their role in this direction <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not agree <e> <s> one accepts that the arrangements contained in this amendment when they were passed right back in were extremely necessary to ensure the reformation if that is the word of our educational system but they are simply out of date now <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will answer although i am conscious that i am jolly nearly trespassing on amendment no <e> <s> and it is not my intention so to do <e> <s> may i take up the point about boarding fees <e>

respect of children whose parents are perfectly able to afford them <e>", "<cs> my lords i have great sympathy with those who support this amendment even when in the case of noble lords and baronesses opposite i am not sure that they do it with the purest of motives <e> <s> may i clear up the position first of all <e> <s> under the bill assisted places are in respect of fees for education <e> <s>

i would ask the noble lord lord ross if he were minded to speak to amendment no <e> <s> or any other noble lord for that matter who has scottish interests at heart to consider that <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall address my remarks to amendment no <e> <s> and with the greatest of speed say that amendment no <e> <s> is four-square but i am not going to say anything more after that <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> seeks to impose on education authorities an obligation to ensure that provision is made free of charge for any pupil whose family is receiving a rent rebate or a rate rebate <e> <s> noble lords will appreciate that this is an obligation which goes beyond even the authoritys present duty and of course well beyond the duty imposed by the clause <e> <s> under the present law authorities must provide free meals for two groups of children the first group consists of those whose parents are receiving supplementary benefit and family income supplement and receipt of those benefits automatically confers entitlement to free school meals <e> <s> these children are sometimes referred to as the passport beneficiaries <e> <s> clause continues to impose a duty in relation to these children <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i could respond to my two territorial comrades <e> <s> dealing first with the concern raised by the noble lord lord hughes i do not think that my territorial ministerial status need put me off from conveying to my noble friend who sits next to me on this bench what would seem to be if i may say so a sensible suggestion <e> <s> i think that a circular will be issued and in it these <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> with the leave of the house may i make it plain if i have to make it plain that the greater part of my remarks were on the english amendment which was moved by the noble viscount lord simon amendment no <e> <s> and then i turned for a few sentences to deal with amendment no <e> <s> because i hoped that thereby i would save the time of the house <e> <s> however in fact everything that i said applies <e>", "<cs> my lords may i answer the noble lords point <e> <s> under clause what we are giving the local authorities is a discretion and therefore there is no question of a direction <e> <s> you cannot invite a local authority to exercise a discretion and give it a direction at the same time <e> <s> that would be a contradiction in terms and that is why i said that there will be a circular which will make recommendations to the local authorities <e> <s> i have no doubt that as in scotland on the whole they conduct their affairs in a fair sensible and responsible manner they will pay attention to the circular and comport themselves accordingly <e> <s> as to the staffing results from this i am afraid that i cannot answer that question tonight <e> <s> i shall make inquiries <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will know very well section of the education scotland act which is the enabling power to provide meals at present specifically includes a duty in section on education authorities to <e>", "<cs> my lords i will of course convey the noble lords sentiments and token of admiration to my right honourable friend tomorrow morning at our ministers meeting <e> <s> but the reason for clause which i think is obvious to the noble lord lord ross is that it is intended merely to bring the law into line with the present position <e> <s> as he said education authorities have in practice extended a discretion in the <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be that the term free-for-all is putting the matter too strongly <e> <s> what i mean is that the likes of the noble lord lord winstanley can make his thoughts and advice felt now in a way that he could not so very long ago <e> <s> i agree that in the end the authority if that is the right word which has the sanction so far as these matters are concerned are the departments of agriculture <e> <s> that must be right <e> <s> however what i am trying to say is that i consider and the government consider having reviewed the matter that the processes at the moment are reasonably satisfactory although as i quite admit they can be irksome at moments to the would-be developer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged <e> <s> the question of liaison <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly not the policy of the commission to enter into competition especially unfair competition with the private sector <e> <s> by reason of the cash limits which have been imposed upon it the commission is perforce having to reduce fairly drastically its own planting programme for next year <e> <s> i imagine and i hope that this will not be used in evidence against me if i may quote the time honoured phrase that its efforts in disposing of surplus plants is a way of minimising the loss which would otherwise occur <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall look into the matter and if necessary it can be rectified in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e> <s> i should like to take this opportunity to restate if that is the correct word the governments position so far as this bill is concerned <e> <s> outside this house i think i am right and justified in saying that there has been a vociferous and at times ill-informed campaign of opposition on the grounds that the bill seriously diminished civil rights <e> <s> we reject that charge <e> <s> we believe that the supreme civil right is the freedom to go about ones business without fear of assault on person or property <e> <s> we believe deeply fundamentally in the citizens right to expect that he will be protected from the activities of the criminally-inclined and the violently-disposed <e> <s> we believe that regrettably that freedom has been seriously eroded in recent years <e> <s> we are concerned to reverse that trend to halt the ever-increasing incidence of crime particularly violent crime and we are convinced that such reversal will not be achieved without giving adequate powers to our law enforcement agencies <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the quality that counts <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall respond to some of the points that have been made at this final stage of the bill at least for the moment <e> <s> i confirm at once to my noble friend lord drumalbyn that sufficiency of evidence is a matter of law which may be considered on appeal and i hope that will satisfy him <e> <s> nobody knows better than i do the sustained efforts he has made in a case which gave rise to much misgiving <e> <s> the proposals in schedule as he stated <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate my noble friends concern in the matter but regret i cannot comment further on this aspect of the question since my right honourable friend is presently considering a formal representation from the consultative council which may in due course lead to his issuing a direction to the board <e> <s> it would not be appropriate for me to express any opinion on the legality and still less the merits of the boards decision <e> <s> i should add that the fixing of tariffs is a matter for the commercial judgment of the board and apart from the possibility of issuing a direction to the board following a representation from the consultative council the government have no powers to intervene in the boards decision in such matters <e>", "<cs> my lords without necessarily agreeing with my noble friends estimate of the gentlemans capabilities as secretary of state i am aware of the historical aspects of this particular question <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble and learned friend the lord advocate i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> it is a consolidation measure which incorporates amendments to give effect to recommendations of the scottish law commission <e> <s> it consolidates certain enactments relating to education in scotland and apart from the amendments which are intended to remove certain minor anomalies in existing law the bill makes no change in the existing law <e> <s> if your lordships approve the bill will be referred to the joint committee on consolidation bills which will consider it and make its report to the house in due course <e> <s> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i must thank the noble lord for those <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate what my noble friend says <e> <s> unfortunately the fact remains that this plant has never been viable and in any event was coming to the end of its useful life so far as the machinery is concerned <e> <s> in those circumstances the firm of wiggins teape gave notice that they could no longer continue in production <e> <s> so far as my noble friends second point is concerned i want to emphasise that the export of wood as a raw material in these circumstances is of course if i may say so repugnant but it will in fact save not only the private forestry sector but also the jobs of many employees of the forestry commission and it is a short-term measure to keep the forestry industry going <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am aware of the keen disappointment of the workforce about this closure indeed i met a section of them only last week and if i had any doubts they certainly removed them <e> <s> the difficulty of the matter is that although as my right honourable friend announced in another place the government had assistance available under section of the industry <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend may be aware and certainly some members of your lordships house will know that ministers responsible for forestry are currently reviewing aspects of forestry policy and we hope to be in a position to make an announcement soon <e>", "<cs> my lords i hoped i had already covered what the noble lord is asking <e> <s> the state agencies were ready willing and if i may say so filled with necessary funds to come to the aid of the particular firm in this instance who were going to take over from wiggins teape and produce a new wood processing industry at fort william <e> <s> as i said we were as a government available to offer advice and encouragement and perhaps more important the necessary cash i would emphasise on a grant basis and not on a basis of loan which we hoped would be sufficient to continue the employment of those who are currently engaged in the wiggins teape operation at fort william <e> <s> but as i said unfortunately the canadian firm in question came to the conclusion at the end of the day that the whole operation would not be sufficiently profitable so far as they were concerned in the sense that it would not give them the return on their money to which they felt they were entitled and in those circumstances they withdrew <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank noble lords and my noble friend lady hornsby-smith for their general welcome of the bill <e> <s> with regard to the white fish authority i concur with what was in effect said by the noble lords lord mackie of benshie and lord peart in praise of this body which has done and continues to do a great job <e> <s> we in government feel particularly in view of the absence of herring which unfortunately has been all too obvious for some years now though one hopes that the position will be improved before very long that a new body which will take the place of the two existing bodies is ripe for emergence <e> <s> we have been in active consultation with the industry and here i include such parts of the industry as the processors the boat builders and other people who are one point or two points removed from the actual fishermen <e> <s> i think i can say without exceeding my brief that the present position is that having regard to the pressures of the parliamentary timetable attention is being paid and paid urgently to a new successor body <e> <s> but i should not want to go farther than that and i hope that noble lords will not press me <e>", "<cs> my lords the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble viscount so that i can answer his question <e> <s> what does he mean by overlap in this case <e> <s> does he mean spheres of influence time or what <e>", "<cs> my lords in case my noble friend wants to intervene again may i direct his attention to clause of what i call the english bill when i think all will be unfolded <e> <s> i see that the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey is nodding <e>", "<cs> my lords i venture to suggest that this has been an interesting debate not least because it shows up almost more starkly than anything else since i have been in this house the complete division between the parties and their philosophy <e> <s> from the very first time when i sat where the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey is sitting now and made what at any rate at that moment i thought was a jolly good attack on what we considered to be the vindictive finance bill of the day in i think and all that it proposed speaking personally for a moment i do not think i have ever seen a bill which so clearly shows up the two parties and their respective philosophies <e> <s> the oppositions one-two attack on the bill with two front bench speakers amply illustrates this <e>", "<cs> my lords what i will say to the noble lord is that as our policies begin to bite and take effect i foresee the situation coming back to and then the noble lord will finally be silenced about this business of mandates <e> <s> i will say no more <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord is really preaching to the converted <e> <s> if he says that he personally or his noble friend has experienced difficulty with these things then i say so say all of us <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not with respect accuse the noble and learned lord of making a threat <e> <s> i said threats had been made and i was particularly careful in what i said <e> <s> i know that the noble and learned lord who has held high office would deplore as much as i would any proposal on the part of people not to respect the bill when it becomes an act of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i am saying that the noble and learned <e>", "<cs> not approved by the local democrats <e> <s>

extent and scope of the legislation <e> <s> i shall try to disabuse noble lords if that is not being offensive of what may be misconceptions <e>", "<cs> yes my lords because the forestry commission does not farm deer <e> <s> if the commission farmed deer it would be just as concerned as anyone else <e> <s> the keeper of a forest such as the forestry commission or anyone in the private sector for that matter is not concerned with these orders because such a keeper is not a deer farmer <e>", "<cs> my lords agricultural land which is one of the questions i was asked is defined in both countries

house this evening apply to both countries <e> <s> in fact everything which i have said applies although with different legislation to both countries <e>", "<cs> the committee will not be altogether surprised and i am sure the noble lord lord ross certainly will not be if i describe certainly the second amendment as a wrecking amendment because that is in effect precisely what it is <e> <s> what these amendments seek to do is to render the right to buy ineffective and to replace it with some form of qualified right exercisable effectively at the discretion of the local authority <e> <s> as such these amendments call into question one of the basic principles of the bill that is to say the right of a tenant to buy his own home <e> <s> if i may say so as one of the basic principles of the bill that really fell to be discussed as indeed it was on second reading rather than in committee <e> <s> nevertheless the fact that we did that and the fact that this principle has been discussed i was going to say <e>", "<cs> i am sitting here <e>", "<cs> i do not want to prolong the agony <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord lord underhill was in his place or attending but on the assumption that the answer to one of those questions may be no i tried to say that the plan drawn up by the noble lord lord ross of marnock by which local authorities will produce their relevant local

private sector as well <e> <s> nevertheless i suppose i do have to take this argument as a would-be serious contribution to the deliberations of the committee although perhaps i shall do so fairly

misunderstanding about the financial considerations which are relevant to selling council houses and i will attempt to explain it <e> <s> it is frequently suggested that the fact that an authority has spent a certain sum of money on a house in the past is relevant to what it ought to obtain for it in selling it <e> <s> this overlooks the fact that once money has been spent by an authority nothing will bring it back and the only sensible way of looking at the financial implications of a choice between two options is by looking at the future income and expenditure connected with each of those options <e> <s> in the case of the choice between renting and sales the balance of financial advantage lies firmly with selling as i have indicated already in previous debates and any change in the terms of sale which makes it less likely that people will buy such as the one proposed in this amendment will therefore have the consequence that more public expenditure will be required to subsidise the retention of the house for renting <e> <s> far from being good financial sense this amendment would leave the taxpayer and ratepayer worse off <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say that i do not find it at all easy to reply to the amendment proposed by the noble lord <e> <s> the various persons referred to in subsection who have their rights referred to there are then set out in subsection as the noble lord has said <e> <s> it seems to me that this is a fairly extensive list of public authorities the employees of which are deemed to be what shall i say <e> <s> worthy enough to have the rights

that tenancy for discount and for the qualifying time in respect of any house covered by the right to buy of which he may later acquire the tenancy <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but the forestry commission was included as a result of an opposition amendment in the other place <e> <s> it was the opposition who objected to crown employees so if there is an absence of logic it stems principally from the opposition <e>", "<cs> the amendment would if accepted drastically enlarge the scope of the exclusions from the right to buy contained in clause c so that instead as it now is of being limited to sheltered housing for the elderly or disabled it would extend to all houses forming part of a group <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount has caught me unawares <e> <s> i shall look

already had a very full debate on sheltered housing <e> <s> i say one thing and i do not say it in a contentious spirit <e> <s> i am not going to be tempted to go forward now and start discussing the

split up in exactly the same way as are houses for the disabled <e> <s> the effect of the first part of the noble lords amendment would be to exclude from the right to which i have said again and again the government attach great importance tenants living in houses which may well be of a type of which an authority has a shortfall <e> <s> it would mean anyone young or old living in a small dwelling which the authority can claim ordinarily to let to the elderly <e> <s> that is terribly wide and one could not possibly accept an amendment like that <e> <s> it is far too imprecise in its drafting and i suggest in its thought <e>", "<cs> it is so tempting to say that i will reconsider and go away and either do it or go through the motions i have sat on that side of the house and it has happened again and <e>", "<cs> so i fancy it will with this amendment <e> <s> what i suppose could happen is that a housing authority could produce its plan record therein that it considers that the balance of housing will be disturbed by further sales whatever that means seek approval and it would be up to the secretary of state to give it or not <e> <s> i have not addressed my mind as to whether in those circumstances the secretary of state would be acting <e>", "<cs> i was going to ask the noble lord before he sat down where his amendment differed from the first part of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> but he assures me that there is a difference and i suppose we shall have to be content with that <e>", "<cs> the trouble is that no is a shorter word than yes and i have to use it <e>

sector tenants from the right to buy <e> <s> i do not conceal from the committee for a moment that selling multi-storey flats has conveyancing problems but we do not accept that they are insuperable <e> <s> several local authorities in england have experience of selling multi-storey flats <e> <s> in any event it is no part of the policy embodies in this bill to allow the administrative convenience of local authorities to prevail over the interests of tenants <e> <s> our approach from the tenants point of view is that council tenants are responsible adults capable of making up their own minds <e> <s> if there are snags which are inherent in the buying of multi-storey flats they should of course be explained to the tenants <e>", "<cs> if i may finish my sentence the noble lord can <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is perfectly right when he says that this amendment in fact highlights a <e>", "<cs> i am inclined to agree with the noble lord lord mackie of benshie in that there are two proposals contained in the amendment one of which certainly deserves more consideration than the other <e> <s> dealing with the less meritorious one first that is the proposal that because a house has had works carried out to it since local government reorganisation a tenant should not be entitled to an option to buy it at a certain price even though he could have bought it at that price if he had the money clause is concerned with helping people who fall just below the level of being able to afford home ownership <e> <s> if one accepts that principle there is no case for discriminating between that sort of tenant in one <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that the time that the noble lord mentions <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say that i regard this amendment as being purely cosmetic <e> <s> it is difficult to see what information the would-be borrower could provide on the form which the secretary of state is going to prescribe by statutory instrument which would enable the local authority to as it were test his character when it is he who is going to supply the information which cannot readily he gained in other ways <e> <s> the form is going to prescribe the applicants own personal financial position other liabilities which he has attracted and a statutory statement that he has in fact been unable to obtain a sufficient building society loan <e> <s> i cannot see what else he could be expected to put by way of answering questions or relating information which could possibly help the local authority to carry out its statutory function unless of course this is in fact a concealed paving amendment for another amendment which the noble lord is going to move in the not too distant future which would give the local authority the right to refuse such an application of its own discretion <e> <s> then of course this amendment might have some point but as the bill stands no <e>", "<cs> i hope that this short consideration of clause <e>", "<cs> reconsideration is an on-going process to quote the trendy phrase and there is reconsideration and reconsideration and those of us who can think like lightning on our feet can reconsider all sorts of things as we do that <e> <s> but i hope speaking seriously for a moment that the compendiousness of the governments proposals will be taken into account by those who are uneasy about some of these things <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is quite right eight years since he went into public sector housing so he does not have to give back any of the discount at all <e> <s> it is possible to read something suspicious and unworthy in almost anything to do with human activity or endeavour but i should have thought that this clause was eminently reasonable and i would suggest that it gets the approval of your lordships

doubt hopes <e> <s> as the noble lord said it is in fact modelled on the provision in the housing bill relating to rural areas <e> <s> it would restrict purchases of council houses in rural areas

agrees otherwise secondly if the secretary of state gives permission by the imposition of a preemption condition <e> <s> i say at once that the way in which this amendment came to be written into the english bill was to satisfy a set of conditions which simply does not obtain in scotland <e> <s> it is in any event unacceptable <e> <s> i and the government have made it clear on numerous occasions as regards this bill that we do not consider that the widespread use of pre-emption conditions is justified <e> <s> indeed we think that the <e>", "<cs> i specifically said absolutely the opposite <e> <s> i said that this had been debated extensively in another place <e> <s> i specifically said that this in no way stops your lordships from giving the whole matter anxious consideration but that it

it would be so easy for me to say to the committee yes of course i will go away and think about it but i hope that i can persuade at least the majority of your lordships that there really is not any need to do so because all the safeguards that noble lords want are already written in <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is so quick to the point <e> <s> he has gone rushing on to the next subsection <e> <s> i have not got there yet <e> <s> i am just coming to it <e> <s> subsection limits the secretary of states power to make an order under subsection confirming <e>", "<cs> clause of the bill confers the right to buy on tenants in public sector housing <e> <s> i say that very generally i am trying merely to marry up some of the clauses so as to make the position clear <e> <s> clause places duties on

the local authority if it is behaving awkwardly in the carrying out of its duties under clause <e>", "<cs> i do not think i can elaborate on that any further <e> <s> if there are any disputes about loans which is a different matter they will fall to be settled in the sheriff court <e> <s> if time delays occur during litigation normal rules applying to lands tribunals will mean that the lands tribunal would as it were suspend its operations pending the settlement of the case in court <e> <s> so the two dovetail in quite well together <e> <s> i think if i may say so that if the noble lord goes back and reads this clause in conjunction with clause it becomes plain <e>", "<cs> these amendments all bear upon the authorities whose tenants would if the amendments were accepted become secure tenants and who therefore would possess particular rights such as the right to buy protection against summary eviction and the right to succession for members of their families resident in the house <e> <s> it will perhaps help to explain that the list of bodies presently included in subsection of clause of the bill is composed entirely of public landlords for which the provision of housing is the primary function and i should emphasise that phrase <e> <s> that is the criterion for inclusion of any body in this list <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has invited me to accept the amendment and as he puts it to make my name <e> <s> i must tell him that if i did any such thing i should without doubt lose it certainly among my colleagues <e> <s> i will however re-state our reasons for resisting the inclusion of this english provision into our scottish bill <e> <s> the effect of the amendment is to oblige landlords to prepare a scheme for consultation with tenants on matters of housing management which affect them <e> <s> the noble lord has borrowed this provision from the english housing bill but he has apparently overlooked the fact that elsewhere in that bill there is a definition of a matter of housing management <e> <s> without such a statutory definition it would be extremely difficult to establish criteria governing the matters which should be placed before tenants and those matters such as rents which perhaps should not <e> <s> so before this should become the ross amendment perhaps further thought should be given by him to the criteria <e> <s> however that is not our major objection to this provision <e> <s> that objection rests on the absence of evidence of unfulfilled demand for consultation about general management decisions from the majority of tenants in scotland <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has correctly stated paragraph of schedule excludes tenancies under long leases from being secure tenancies <e> <s> his amendment which he has admitted is probing would exclude that <e> <s> unlike england in scotland long leases as the noble lord quite rightly says in effect have suffered disapproval for many years and since the land tenure reform scotland act the creation of new long leases for residential property has actually been illegal in scotland <e> <s> the reason for excluding that form of tenant from security under this bill is that it is considered more a form of ownership than of tenancy <e> <s> a tenant on a long lease of years or more has rights of virtual ownership over the property for that term <e> <s> he does not need additional rights of the type accorded to secure tenancies because he already has them <e>", "<cs> subsection did not read wholly felicitously <e> <s> if one takes amendment no <e> <s> and reads it with that to my brain at any rate it is much more comprehensible <e> <s> the effect of the clause is that the right to succession to a secure tenancy at present extends to only one succession except where there are joint tenants but these amendments would in effect provide for an unlimited right of succession as long as any joint tenant surviving spouse or member of the tenants family remains living in the house <e> <s> the bill as it stands provides a right of succession only once as i have said and not for an unlimited number of times except in the case of joint tenants where the right to <e>", "<cs> throughout these proceedings the noble lord has castigated the government for not allowing responsible local authorities the discretion in the matter and this is precisely what we are allowing them <e> <s> we are saying that there should be on a death one succession but not more than one unless there are joint tenants <e> <s> there is no earthly reason why a responsible local authority as i have suggested should not accept the survivor i called it a child but you can have some pretty old children even though they are still children into the tenancy <e> <s> i think the proof of the pudding is in the eating and neither cosla nor any of the tenants associations had anything to say about this <e> <s> apparently they thought that the provision as embodied in the bill is perfectly satisfactory <e> <s> really if one started to make the secure tenancy pass more than once it would open the thing up much too much if one stops to think about it <e>", "<cs> public <e>", "<cs> i am getting nearer to accepting one of the noble lords amendments <e> <s> in fact this is not an objectionable amendment although it is taken verbatim from the english housing bill <e> <s> but we consider that it is better left to be encompassed in the general criterion in our bill which is not paralleled in the housing bill <e> <s> that refers as the noble lord has said to <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ross proposes that people who are accepted as sub-tenants by tenants of housing authorities with those authorities consent and at their request should automatically have the right to be re-housed by the authority if for any reason the main tenancy comes to an end <e>", "<cs> we see no reason why a landlords consent to sub-letting or taking lodgers should be subject to conditions <e> <s> already there are provisions which allow the landlord to ensure that no excessive charges are made and i do not see that there are other matters about which the landlord need concern himself <e> <s> if one looks at the private rented sector or at owner-occupiers renting out their homes one sees that it is often necessary for the consent of the landlord or the building society to be obtained but it would be unusual for conditions to be attached <e> <s> consequently we see no reason why public sector tenants should be subject to such restrictions <e> <s> there have been too many petty restrictions in the past and this bill is an attempt to set tenants free from unnecessary interference with the use of their homes <e> <s> it is a matter of reasonableness <e>", "<cs> there is no question of paragraph of schedule in any way fettering the discretion of the sheriff or indeed of imposing upon him any restrictions whether petty or otherwise <e> <s> the amendment would deprive the court of the guidance which paragraph offers to it <e> <s> perhaps i may resolve the noble lords anxieties about this paragraph if i point out that the considerations are not meant to be exclusive as mentioned in paragraph <e>", "<cs> there is every difference in the world between those matters and what is contemplated and embraced by a subparagraph such as <e>", "<cs> no because honorary sheriffs do not get paid <e> <s> i really have a non-interest <e>", "<cs> my understanding of the matter is that the sheriff consents or does not consent <e>", "<cs> in the vast majority of cases there can be no doubt that a tenant should be able to put up a television or wireless aerial and i have no doubt that landlords will give automatic consent in those cases <e> <s> however wireless and television aerials are not always the unobtrusive structures which one would like and one would tolerate <e> <s> they could be very large and unsightly structures where it would be right in some instances that a landlord should have some say <e> <s> for example to impose restrictions on where they are located and how they are secured in the interests of the safety of those living round the property <e>", "<cs> the provision to which the amendment refers does not give tenants the right to be reimbursed for works which they or their successors under the same tenancy may have carried out it merely gives the landlord discretion to reimburse in such cases if it sees fit <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord grasps the distinction <e>", "<cs> yes it is discretionary and the effect of the amendment if the noble lord meant iti do not think he didwould be to remove the discretion of the landlord to reimburse in cases where the works were carried out by a predecessor in the same tenancy <e> <s> this of course refers to a tenancy which has been passed from one member of a family to another on the death of the first under clause <e>", "<cs> yes it is unisex <e>", "<cs> i am always prepared to consider the arguments of a simple man <e> <s> although the meaning is perfectly plain to those of us who can interpret the statute i am inclined to agree with the noble lord that we must try to look after those who may not be able to read the statute quite so well <e> <s> accordingly i accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> this is a drafting point that was discussed in another place and at the suggestion of the noble lords successor in title my honourable friend agreed to consider just this point <e> <s> he has done so with the draftsman and we remain of the view that the bill as it stands more accurately expresses what is meant than do the words suggested in the amendment <e> <s> i am reluctant to be drawn into a discussion on semantics particularly when it comes to drafting but the use of the word determine in the amendment suggests that the rules lead inexorably to the final decision whereas our information about the allocation methods of local authorities indicates that in most areas the rules are a guide on the basis of which officials or councillors make final decisions and it is this process that the bill is intended to embrace its use of the word give implying less conclusiveness than does the word determine <e> <s> for those reasons i hope that the noble lord will withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> subsection which amendment no <e> <s> would delete effects a further release of local authorities from interference by central government in their affairs <e> <s> it frees islands and district councils from an unnecessary restriction in housing finance decision-making and it prevents local authorities from being placed in a difficulty over their rent policies <e> <s> section of the housing rents and subsidies scotland act allows authorities to charge such reasonable rents as they may <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has raised two points <e> <s> the first relates to the quantum and so far as that <e>", "<cs> section of the housing rents and subsidies scotland act confers on the secretary of state a power to limit or restrict individual authorities council house rent increases so what subsection of this clause does is to remove yet another impediment to local decision-making that is to say it removes the possibility of interference by the secretary of state in the fixing of local council house rent levels <e> <s> there is no reason to suppose that any tenant will be disadvantaged by the governments relinquishing this power of intervention and i commend it to the committee on that basis <e>", "<cs> i really think that this debate would have been very much better on the question whether the clause shall stand part <e> <s> than on a minute amendment taken by itself <e> <s> however perhaps we could have it now <e> <s> i start by saying or by repeating that local authorities cannot by statute charge unreasonable rents and this is made plain by section of the act <e> <s> i start from that point <e>", "<cs> one can make it positive or negative whichever way one likes to and i do not mind splitting hairs <e> <s> but if the point of the noble lord is that local authorities are going to use the freedomand he has at moments in the discussions on this bill urged the government to allow local authorities freedomto be reasonable according to their lights this is a point of view which the government share <e> <s> there are moments when one has to give local authorities guidelines and other moments when one has to fetter their discretion in one direction or another particularly if one thinks that it will not be very sensibly used <e> <s> but all things considered we believe as i think the noble lord does that local authorities ought to be left alone to do their job to the best of their ability <e>", "<cs> the noble lady was good enough to apprise me of her worry by letter <e> <s> i am bound to say that in my way i had assumed that her worry was to do with the use made of receipts from council house sales which is a very different matter from what she now talks about which is the use to which is put any surplus from what we all hope is going to be the rising level of council house rents <e> <s> they are two different matters as i am sure the noble lady will appreciate <e> <s> so far as rents are concerned i can do no more than to echo the remarks of the noble lord lord ross when he said in effectand i confirmed itthat subsection of this particular clause lays down what a housing authority can do with the credit balance <e> <s> it goes into its general fund under section of the local government scotland act and may be applied to any purpose that any money in that fund can be applied to <e> <s> if the noble lady is saying that any money that comes from housing and the housing revenue account if there is a surplus ought to be kept in some way in a special housing subdivision and devoted in some way to housingand i am reinforced by the noble lord lord ross shaking his headthen that is a simplistic view as far as revenue is concerned and i would not share the noble ladys concern about that <e>", "<cs> before getting into this clause i wonder whether i might ask the noble lord if he is also speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> i am obliged <e>", "<cs> i just want to correct the noble lord on one or two of his more extravagant assertions and assumptions at the risk of precipitating another stream <e> <s> if one concedes as i think the noble lord does that local authorities are to be lenders of last resort it then follows that one cannot give vent to that policy if in fact they are often lending at rates several per cent <e> <s> lower than the building society rates <e> <s> that follows <e>", "<cs> i am sure we would always take the noble lord on trust <e> <s> taffy may be a welshman but the second half of the old saw would never apply in that case <e> <s> powers are at present available to local authorities under section of the housing financial provisions scotland act to guarantee repayment of advances and interest thereon in respect of particular home loans granted by building societies <e> <s> these powers enable a local authority with the approval of the secretary of state to guarantee part or all of a home loan <e> <s> under section of the act the secretary of state may agree to contribute towards losses incurred by a building society where a local authority guarantee relates to the part of a home loan which is in excess of what the building society would have been prepared to <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord ross has said we now come effectively to the phasing amendment if i may so call it <e> <s> as the noble lord was careful to say after he very nearly misled your lordships we have passed now from the public into the private sector <e> <s> it is extremely important to emphasise this because i want to say at the beginning that nothing in the provisions of this part of the bill are going to affect in any way the rights of the tenants so far as the three year period is concerned and it is very important <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has said amendment no <e> <s> would restrict the conversion of controlled tenancies to rent regulation to those which are certified by the local authority as meeting the tolerable standard <e> <s> the only controlled tenancies still in existence are those with a rateable value of under on th august where there has been no change of tenancy since before th july <e> <s> dwellinghouses of such a low rateable value are in the main single rooms in tenement blocks and it is unlikely that many of them currently meet the tolerable standard or indeed that they could be made to meet that standard given the limitation of space <e>", "<cs> the effect of this amendment would be to transfer from the sheriff to the assessor responsibility for apportioning the rateable value where only part of a dwelling-house is subject to a part vii contract <e> <s> ever since the rent restriction amendment act the responsibility for settling disputes between landlord and tenants as to apportionment of rates has been placed on the sheriff in england it is the county

reason for changing what has been the practice since <e> <s> i think my attitude to the noble lord if he really wants me to take this away and look at it is to say tempt me <e>", "<cs> compared to the noble lord the sirens were but corncrakes <e> <s> i will take it away but with no commitment <e>", "<cs> if i could intervene at this stage because we are not going to have a debate on the merits <e>

the noble lord as meaning to be offensive because the clause as drafted shows only part of the new section of the act so that it might appear that only derisory sums are being offered for the installation of amenities <e> <s> the amendments proposed seek to raise the maximum approved expenses for these associated repairs from the present limit of which is the new level for repairs grant

said that in the past local authorities made these sales at sitting tenant values <e> <s> in fact they did not <e> <s> under both the last government and the last conservative government they were based on vacant possession value <e> <s> that does make a great deal of difference as the noble lord has been trying to say <e> <s> we debated all this on committee and i do not want to go over old ground too much particularly if it is going to irritate the noble lord as apparently i did on the last amendment <e> <s> but i must say that the whole object of the exercise is to give as many council

employees of the ministry of defence into the list of bodies whose former tenants can count their past tenancy as qualifying time for discount <e> <s> certain noble lords have already commented on the length of the list and we have already shown that we have been very generous in drawing it up <e> <s> in the course of the bills consideration through parliament we have accepted amendments which have added health board and forestry commission employees to the beneficiaries of this provision <e> <s> these represented some blurring of the lines of the limits placed on the list of bodies which was originally comprised of housing authorities local authorities in their various other guises and two special categories of government employees prison officers and servicemen <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness turn her attention to clause of the bill <e> <s> i recognise the fact that an amendment in these terms was recently incorporated into the housing bill by your lordships house

<e> <s> everyone has said in a rather vague way what they would like to see <e> <s> however i am coming to that matter <e> <s> as i was saying the noble lord lord galpern exemplified the attitude of the opposition on this matter when he said what do the old people want a home of their own for <e> <s> that is an attitude which we certainly do not accept <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is asking me whether a house merely because it happens to be a little house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am asking leave of the house because i really had resumed my seat <e> <s> two totally different types of housing stock are envisaged by the amendment and by what is in clause <e> <s> i have tried to illustrate the difference between the two types of housing stock and i am trying to say that almost any house with the addition of minor alterations would fall within the scope of the amendment and that is by no means true of clause <e>", "<cs> my lords again with even more leave of the house i know that i have a thin voice and that i am not always easily heard but the only provision which clause makes in respect of this type of housing is that it gives a right of pre-emption to the local authority to the landlord once the elderly person comes to dispose of the house <e> <s> that is all that clause says <e> <s> when i said that i attacked the drafting of this particular amendment i tried to say at the beginning of my remarks and obviously failed to get over either through the acoustics or my bad advocacy to the noble lord that i was not in a nit-picking way attacking the technical drafting of the amendment i was attacking it because it was misconceived that in fact it would prove who am ito say it <e> <s> a field-day for the lawyers <e> <s> it would provide a great deal of difficulty for the courts in interpreting such legislation if it came to be put onto the statute book but much more especially it would give those local authorities which wish to evade the provisions of the bill when it becomes an act and which wish to frustrate the will of parliament a gateway through which to drive a coach and horses through the bill <e> <s> that is why i said that the amendment was badly drafted <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i think it is plain english <e> <s> the words substantially different <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord ross said the provisions of schedule are im-impeccably drafted <e> <s> whether the noble lord when he took the wording for his amendment intended to leave out the word special we do not know but whatever his intention was the effect is to broaden the definition and that i suppose he intended <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> i did not know whether he said boarding or bawdy <e>", "<cs> my lords when i first saw this amendment i wondered what it was the noble lord was getting at <e> <s> i am not sure now i know that the amendment commends itself to me any the more <e> <s> may we just first of all understand what it is that the tenant is doing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to my noble friend at least i think i am <e> <s> he does not help the logic of the cause because what he is saying is that the secretary of state is going to write down a long list of things of which a potential purchaser should be aware and the purchaser if it is in the form of a letter or a standard form is going to put john smith at the end i suppose with some kind of declaration <e> <s> i am afraid that i cannot see who is going to be advantaged by this certainly not john smith <e> <s> the drafting of this notice or letter would be a nightmare <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble lord for a moment just to satisfy my curiosity it would give this absurd situation a veneer of logic <e> <s> why does not the noble lord invite the government to consider an amendment of this nature in connection with sub-section when at least the tenant really does know the conditions of his purchase because he is then going to accept them <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord ross of marnock has said this amendment was incorporated in the english housing bill against the advice of the government <e> <s> on that occasion the debate lasted rather less than minutes <e> <s> i hope therefore that the house will recognise that the arguments were not fully deployed <e> <s> the reasons for maintaining the <e>", "<cs> then if i may continue i am obliged <e> <s> one of the defects of the amendment is that it is wholly silent as to how the tenant is to <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of this amendment would be to allow a landlord to refuse to sell a house which parliament will have given the tenant a statutory right to buy in any case where it is considered that there are reasonable grounds for so doing <e> <s> whatever may have been the intention of the noble lord when he came to draft this amendment the effect of it is that it is no more and no less than a wrecking amendment <e> <s> there is no doubt that some local authorities would use this to refuse to sell a single house since it is their stated objective that they will stop as many sales as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> of course it goes further than that because if the local authority could use its discretion to evict somebody under this ground the person would not be in a position to buy the house anyway <e>", "<cs> my lords i think my noble friend has shot my fox <e>", "<cs> my lords while the noble lord is talking about dreaming and he has asked me to read the bill i wonder whether he could point to <e>", "<cs> my lords the central issue here is whether it is right for parliament to limit the secretary of states power to allow the imposition of pre-emption conditions <e> <s> i take the view that if parliament knows what it wants to do it should explicitly provide just that in the legislation <e> <s> the effect of this amendment would be to leave it entirely to the discretion of the secretary of state whether or not an area was designated a rural area and in effect whether pre-emption conditions should be applied in that area <e> <s> government spokesmen have made it clear throughout the passage of this bill that they believe very firmly that generally speaking the position in rural areas is the same as it is elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord puts two questions in effect <e> <s> first he asks why is the secretary of state taking powers that are described in for instance clause and <e> <s> the noble lord then asks what form will these orders take and what will they reflect so far as the will of the secretary of state is concerned <e> <s> with regard to subsection the duty of the local authority is to provide loans in order that the tenants who have taken up the right to buy their homes are provided with the means of exercising that right <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment would require the secretary of state in exercising his default powers under any enactment in relation to part i of the bill to do so by statutory instrument subject to the negative resolution procedure <e> <s> really the effect of this amendment would be nothing but an obstacle to proper action being taken by the secretary of state against a local authority which was refusing to carry out its statutory duties <e> <s> it would require the secretary of state to seek parliaments permission through a statutory instrument to take default action against such an authority <e> <s> i ask the house to consider whether it is likely or even imaginable that there are circumstances in which parliament would wish to say to a secretary of state that he must stand idly by while a local authority flouts the law <e> <s> i suggest that such a situation is inconceivable and that it would be a little absurd to require a secretary of state to make a statutory instrument and to make that statutory instrument subject to negative resolution procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords clause provides that every secure tenancy created after the commencement of this clause shall be constituted by writing which shall be probative or holograph of the parties <e> <s> i see the reasonableness and understand the desirability of giving tenants written leases as soon as possible <e> <s> the very fact that this provision is in the bill indicates our sympathy to that proposition <e> <s> however we live in the real world and i do not believe it would be realistic to expect every authority to provide this document to every tenant within one year of the commencement of the clause <e> <s> to quote two examples in the case of glasgow to impose this requirement would mean the preparation of over such documents and arrangements being made for tenants to sign them <e> <s> even a medium sized authority such as motherwell would have over such documents to deal with and signatures <e> <s> the sheer administrative task involved in preparing the leases and ensuring that they are consistent with earlier agreements written or otherwise between the tenant and landlord is enormous and remember we are asking authorities to do this at a time when the bill before us will require them to do a number of novel things to reorganise their housing management arrangements and to set up procedures for selling houses <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the desire of the noble lord but i cannot accept these amendments <e> <s> it is well established that in scotland disputes between landlord and tenant relating to tenancy conditions are settled by the sheriff and there is no good reason why this should be changed now <e> <s> the lands tribunal has historically had a different part to play <e> <s> their main remit is to deal with conditions attached to land and disputes between feuars and land superiors <e> <s> the use in part i of the bill of the lands tribunal is because their specialised knowledge of conveyancing and conditions attached to the disposal of heritable property is appropriate to dealing with the problems which may arise between the landlord as seller and the tenant as purchaser of a house <e> <s> those skills could not appropriately be exercised in dealing with disputes between a landlord and a tenant who intends to continue as a tenant <e> <s> for those reasons i would ask the noble lord to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it might be more useful to talk to both amendments nos <e> <s> and in the context of clause which requires authorities to publish their allocation rules than in relation to clause which prohibits various types of restrictions affecting allocations <e> <s> but be that as it may there is a great difference between the publication of an authoritys allocation and transfer rules and the publication of housing lists <e>", "<cs> my lords i take this to be a probing amendment <e> <s> i do not suppose that the noble lord lord ross really cares so much about subsection as the effects of the clause and i shall try to enlighten him a little <e> <s> the purpose of the clause is to enable a local authority or a housing corporation to indemnify a building society against incidental losses resulting from a borrowers default as well as repayment of the whole or part of a borrowers outstanding debt subject to the secretary of states approval <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord with respect is reading into the clause a sinister connotation which really does not exist <e> <s> it is essential that there is flexibility in relation to the various circumstances that can arise following registration or re-registration of a fair rent <e> <s> subsection of this clause repeals schedule to the housing rents and subsidies scotland act and that schedule covers such matters as definitions of noted amount previous rental limits how to treat rates when they are included in the rent payable what happens when the rent is increased and so on <e> <s> all these and other matters will have to be covered by the order <e> <s> thus it is not possible for the order simply to say that the rent can only go up to ex which is the effect that acceptance of the noble lords amendment would have <e> <s> i do assure the noble lord that the words which he seeks to delete are a standard provision in cases of this nature and i do assure the noble lord that they are unobjectionable <e>", "<cs> my lords clause extends the powers of local authorities to publish information for the assistance of landlords and tenants to include all rights and duties under the rent acts <e> <s> it is desirable that authorities have such powers in order to ensure the dissemination of information about the rights and obligations of tenants and landlords in the private sector <e> <s> such tenants and landlords may not otherwise be in a position easily to discover or to tell each other what their legal position is <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of these amendments is already well known to your lordships through the eloquence of my noble friend and his co-sponsors if that is the word at various moments during the passage of this and the housing bill through your lordships house <e> <s> i am very pleased to be able to recommend both these amendments to your lordships and i should like to pay tribute to my noble friend for the able and agreeable way in which he has pushed forward his point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords an amendment in the same terms was not allowed in the other place because it is outside the money resolution and i am afraid therefore that i cannot now recommend it to your lordships on that ground quite apart from the question of the merits <e> <s> however we can discuss the merits of the amendment and it is proper that we should do so <e> <s> the whole question of control over houses in multiple occupation is at present being studied by the scottish development department and there is also currently going through its parliamentary procedure a comprehensive provisional order sponsored by glasgow district council <e> <s> it is in those contexts that any proposal to pay grants for fire escapes should be considered and it is just not practicable simply to deal with one isolated provision expecting the secretary of state to make an order with no indication of the conditions on which it is based <e>", "<cs> no my lords it appeared yesterday after luncheon <e> <s> i do not criticise the noble lord so far as timing is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to my noble friend for putting down this drafting amendment which certainly makes the different parts of the bill more consistent than they were before <e> <s> i am pleased to accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of amendments nos <e> <s> and would be to grant a right of succession without end for any family allocated a house <e>", "<cs> no my lords the effect of the amendments would be just that <e> <s> in other words a house once allocated could be passed down through the family for generation after generation regardless of need <e> <s> there cannot be any objection to a house passing through several generations of a family where appropriate <e> <s> indeed it is common practice for local authorities to allow this to happen <e> <s> but we believe that every once in a while the landlord should have an opportunity to review the allocation of houses against the background of its responsibility to manage the housing stock <e>", "<cs> my lords the deputy speaker is talking about amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord ross of marnock has said the effect of subsection is that where a tenant dies and leaves either a spouse or another member of the family living in the house in circumstances where they are not entitled to succeed to the tenancy because the tenant himself had inherited by succession the bill grants the person left in the house a non-secure tenancy that is a tenancy which does not attract any of the rights set out in the bill <e> <s> this is for a period of up to six months <e> <s> the period is to allow a reasonable time for both the public sector landlord and the tenant to decide about the future <e> <s> as i said when speaking about amendment no <e> <s> and the others the present practice some suggest is that in almost all cases the landlord will be quite happy to grant the survivor the tenancy of the house <e> <s> in virtually all other cases if for reasons of space which i illustrated the landlord wants the house <e>", "<cs> my lords one reason why i cannot accept this amendment is due to a sin of omission by the noble lord lord ross when he was secretary of state for scotland <e> <s> during the year there were in fact two housing acts one for england and one for scotland <e> <s> the english housing act introduced a grants scheme for houses in multiple occupation in england but the housing scotland act of as i have said during a period when the noble lord lord ross was the distinguished tenant of old st andrews house did not include the same provision <e> <s> therefore we in scotland have no equivalent to the english special grants system which applies to houses in multiple occupation <e> <s> i am afraid that remains the position <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now

of it that was another one <e> <s> but i am not going to give vent to it because this bill has been most thoroughly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble lord wishes to be fair and if he is going to quote me in column perhaps he would continue to the end of the intervention <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> in fact it is not totally inappropriate that should be moving these motions today because part of my ministerial responsibility is agriculture in scotland and indeed these statutory instruments are signed by the secretary of state for scotland <e> <s> so it is quite appropriate for me to take off my kilt to put on my pants and trousers and pontificate in this way <e> <s> i say this for a purpose my lords because these orders will apply in scotland in the same way as they do in the rest of the united <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot intervene in the middle of the debate <e> <s> i have carefully taken down what my noble friend has said <e> <s> i will answer his points in due course if i may <e>", "<cs> my lords i come back to the merits of the matter <e> <s> my noble friend the leader of the house has given his opinion to your lordships so far as

which have been very properly and naturally and genuinely expressed particularly by a number of the bodies who are interested in conservation as this long matter has been unfolded have become i would not say groundless but perhaps of slightly less importance than they were before <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord must not put words into my mouth <e> <s> i never said anything about getting a guarantee <e> <s> i said that farmers will be encouraged to do what they have always done get advice <e> <s> that i suggest will provide the support they need when they are making their investment

thoroughly distinguished secretary of state my understanding of the situation is that no agreement in those terms was sought on these matters nor was given <e> <s> indeed my right honourable friend is meeting the convention only this afternoon to tell them what is going to happen so i fear that the answer to all his questions is no <e> <s> so far as the question of the noble lord lord galpern is concerned which the officials box understood if i did not and i apologise to him for my stupidity and obtuseness the secretary of state will decide at the appropriate time whether and when the next revaluation will take place <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords <e> <s> i do not quite follow the noble lord <e> <s> assumptions were made on inflation but i do not know about the rest of his question <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> all these matters would have been taken into account <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i understood exactly that <e> <s> but the question to which my right honourable friend had to address himself was the level of rate support grant <e> <s> with all respect that is rather a different matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord cromartie for putting down this motion today <e> <s> i apologised to him in advance by <e>", "<cs> i am coming to dignity and status my lords but perhaps the noble lord will permit me to finish the train of thought i had <e> <s> i wonder whether the citizens of rosehearty leaving aside for the moment considerations of dignity and status would accept the noble lords contention that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it depends on whether the labour party puts a collar on the noble lord giving a name and address <e> <s> if that is done and if the proper charges are paid the noble lord will not be so destroyed <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not quite reached the end of my remarks because i was going to give the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley such undertaking as i am able to give <e> <s> he said that he thought the regulations should be available by the time the bill hopefully receives its third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i take my noble friends point <e> <s> the noble lord lord beaumont raised a number of very detailed points and my noble friend or i will write to him <e> <s> the five-year after-care period is needed for agriculture and forestry because without it land is not properly restored <e> <s> we do not believe that the same considerations apply to other situations such as recreational uses <e> <s> as to another point that the noble lord raised a certificate of completion certifies that restoration has been completed <e> <s> if working has been abandoned the planning authority can revoke the planning permission under the procedures proposed in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords probably i should congratulate the noble lord lord howie of troon upon his first appearance at the dispatch box <e>", "<cs> i congratulate the noble lord with great sincerity since he is the only scottish labour peer who has recovered from the celebration of burns birthday which i think is saying something and i apply similar comments to the noble viscount lord thurso who has managed to struggle here even if not quite on time <e> <s> if i may say so and i do not want to be offensive about this i went into these four little schemes fairly fully in my opening remarks and i want to emphasise that the amounts of money are simply infinitesimal not in private terms but in the context of public money <e> <s> the grants have never recently been popular particularly so far as open space is concerned <e> <s> very few local authorities have availed themselves of the grant and it is in the order of or per local authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house will be grateful to my noble friend lord colville for introducing his bill and also for explaining its purpose and effects <e> <s> the government welcome the bill as a useful piece of law reform <e> <s> as my noble friend has explained it is based to a large extent on the recommendations of the law commission which are contained in their report on forgery and counterfeit currency <e> <s> the government are in broad agreement with the recommendations contained in that report and are therefore pleased to lend their support to the proposals in this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships have been over this course before and the noble lord lord ross of marnock is quite right <e> <s> i think that the time before last i responded to him in your lordships chamber and followed it up with a letter <e> <s> the resource implications of these confirmation bills are extremely modest <e> <s> the only details which i have come from edinburgh which has appointed two dog wardens and the whole operation costs a few thousand pounds in respect of their wages and certain back-up <e> <s> so we are really talking in <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords the last occasion upon which the powers of the trustees to borrow money were raised was and therefore the sum which is now sought as a limit in this bill has of course increased with inflation <e> <s> i can tell the noble lord lord ross that the trustees have no immediate need to borrow and indeed no particular intention of borrowing sums which will in any way approximate to million <e> <s> i can also tell the noble lord that the trustees are in the final throes if that is the right word of finalising proposals for a three stage harbour development which will include roads some land reclamation a boat lift and a yard <e> <s> the consulting engineers estimate that this will cost some million by the projected completion date in mid- <e> <s> i hope therefore that the house will agree that this increase in the borrowing powers on the part of the trustees is reasonably modest considering how long it has been since the matter was last considered by your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i must thank both noble lords for receiving this statement <e> <s> of course nobody would pretend other than that this news has the gravest implications for west-central scotland <e> <s> i think that both noble lords have said that this has been the one car-making assembly line which has existed in scotland up till now <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it right that i should remind the house of the particular paragraph in the declaration of intent which was made in under which the company undertook to continue and strengthen chryslers programme of modernisation and facilities and investment in order <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with the noble lord <e> <s> there are many cases where foreign firms have come in with new ideas and capital and have provided new and very much needed employment in scotland <e> <s> this is something where we could join in with for instance the citizens of ireland who have done extremely well out of foreign investment in their country <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we should keep apart the taxpayers money which is being devoted to british leyland and any rescue operation which might have been contemplated and implemented at linwood <e> <s> what i can tell my noble friend is that if a scheme had been and could have been produced the government were ready and willing to play their part with the taxpayers money to help it on <e> <s> that goes for any future scheme or ideas which may be put forward for assistance under the industry act the money as it were can be made available if a scheme is produced and is viable <e>", "<cs> my lords the factory at linwood as i understand it has never been profitable and therefore no doubt this has been in the minds of many people for about years <e> <s> it certainly occupied the last government and it has occupied this government in turn <e> <s> there has been the payment of losses as i said amounting to million incurred in the united kingdom business of chrysler and there is an outstanding debt in relation to that of million payable to the government <e> <s> perhaps i can best answer the noble lord in this way yes there will continue to be closures unless and until british factories can produce the right goods at the right time at the right price for customers who are prepared to pay for them <e> <s> there is luckily in scotland particularly in the new electronic industry a growing realisation that that must happen if we are to remain a trading nation and be competitive and i am glad to say that there are more and more factories in scotland now producing goods which are exciting the attention of worldwide customers and i have no doubt they will succeed <e>", "<cs> my lords the trouble is that nissan have said they want acres in a greenfield site <e> <s> i do not know the acreage of linwood but i think it is about one-tenth and it is certainly not green-field but we shall certainly bear these points in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have been privy to the thoughts and difficulties of psa for some time <e> <s> various schemes were put up or various ideas were rehearsed to try to prevent <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer that directly because i am not conversant with what has happened in those countries <e> <s> the prime reasons for the difficulties at linwood were out-of-date models out-of-date machinery a world recession with a reducing demand and a heavy pound <e>", "<cs> i can confirm to my noble friend lord mottistone that the after-care condition must relate to a restriction condition already on the permission <e> <s> i should like to raise a couple of matters because we are now getting to the more financial parts of the bill <e> <s> the purpose of these amendments is to delete the current reference to mineral compensation requirements being satisfied in relation to a section order where the planning permission which is being modified by the order was granted not less than five years before the date of the order and to incorporate the requirement in a revised wording which also provides for modified compensation to be payable when a section order modifies a planning permission granted before the commencement of section a being added by clause but only imposes an aftercare condition <e> <s> this matter of compensation is indeed complex <e> <s> although further details were given in the consultation paper perhaps i could say this as we are entering this part of the bill <e> <s> we start from the basic premise proposed by the stevens committee that where the conditions on a minerals planning permission are modified as a result of a review the operator should bear a reasonable amount of any loss or damage incurred by him <e>", "<cs> may i just intervene <e> <s> my noble friend lord mottistone has an amendment to leave out clause which would be perhaps the place to debate these matters <e> <s> i am beginning to regret that i tried to set the scene on an otherwise perfectly inoffensive amendment <e> <s> perhaps it would be more logical if matters such as the regulations were debated at the end of the clause <e>", "<cs> it is a question of balance <e> <s> as happens frequently with the measure one has to recognise the need to protect the industry from too onerous a burden <e> <s> at the same time circumstances may change and it is important in the interests of the environment that sites are kept under review and if necessary the conditions under which mineral working is proceeding or restoration and after-care taking place should be amended <e> <s> the industry has the safeguard that all opposed orders have to be confirmed by the secretary of state and in the circumstances i should have thought that five years was a reasonable interval <e> <s> i think an extension to years would be strongly opposed by local authority interests <e> <s> i hope on reflection that my noble friend will agree that the balance is about right <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that there are two real complaints which have been voiced about the compensation elements of the bill and as my noble friend has said this is really the lead-in to those <e> <s> in effect my noble friend lord mottistone says that stevens is not really being put into effect <e> <s> i think he is arguing that industrys acceptance is based on the whole of the recommendations of the committee being implemented as a package and in particular that the needs of the industry for long-term planning should be recognised <e> <s> my noble friend lord bellwin said on second reading and i think also on the first committee day that in the view of the government these needs are being recognised <e> <s> local planning authorities are including within their development plans strong policies which will mean the grant of the permissions required to meet this countrys needs for minerals in <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is forcing me to be less polite <e> <s> what i did was to set out the five main heads which the regulations will include <e> <s> that is really as far as i can go <e> <s> i also said that we intend to make a detailed of our current intentions on report <e> <s> i told the noble baroness why it cannot be done now because the cbi have reacted but have not yet met officials <e>", "<cs> this amendment applies also to amendments nos <e> <s> and those are the scottish equivalents <e> <s> regulations will need to be made by the secretaries of state and these regulations should cover both the basis for compensation and a threshold below which no compensation is payable <e> <s> the regulations require the approval of each house of parliament by means of affirmative resolution and in the circumstances it would not seem necessary to depart from the usual procedure and impose an absolute obligation upon the secretary of state <e> <s> my remarks apply to the other amendment <e> <s> the contents of the regulations will come before this house and i cannot think it is likely that any government would want to make regulations which did not cover either the basis or the threshold <e> <s> however we should also need to ensure that the second shall will not be interpreted as shall only as there may be other things which we should need to include in regulations <e> <s> i accept the concern of the noble baroness <e> <s> i do not think that it is altogether well founded in this case i hope i am not being offensive and i hope that she may feel able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have already twice now on second reading and this evening given an <e>", "<cs> secretaries of state in my brief experience do spend their time consulting before they do anything <e> <s> nevertheless i shall ponder the matter <e> <s> if the definition can be tightened up and it really is a good idea then we shall come back to the matter on report <e>", "<cs> what this amendment does first is to delete the provisions in the bill which permit an amendment of the basis on which compensation is to be assessed something which has been included to reconcile the existing provisions of sections and of the town and country planning act in respect of mineral working <e> <s> secondly it appears to limit the setting of the threshold rather more than we think desirable <e> <s> the consultation paper issued by the department suggested a figure of per cent <e> <s> rather than per cent <e> <s> in a particular range of quarries <e> <s> we are already aware that different provisions will be necessary for underground and surface workings and for the different types of order to which modified compensation will apply <e>", "<cs> i accept that it would be wrong for mineral planning authorities to make new orders each year and never have to pay compensation <e> <s> that is why we have included a provision that orders must be spaced by at least five years and there is the additional safeguard that all orders must be confirmed by the secretary of state <e> <s> this amendment would mean that when a mineral planning authority had used up its compensation threshold for that particular quarry it would always have to pay full com <e>", "<cs> this is another amendment which in effect seeks to move the government from their point of balance between the views of industry and local authorities <e> <s> my noble friends amendment seeks to extend those matters which attract full compensation to include the areas of tips and their heights <e> <s> it is noteworthy that the stevens committee recommended that the area of the tip should be one of these fundamental conditions but not its height <e> <s> so far as fundamental conditions are concerned the government have taken the view that full compensation should cover those things any of which would fundamentally alter the nature of the planning permission <e>", "<cs> i was not sure of the purpose of my noble friends amendment until he rose to his feet <e> <s> section c sets out clearly just what matters the modification of which will attract full compensation <e> <s> what my noble friends amendment seems to do is to extend the list of matters to include such matters as modification of hours <e> <s> that must be resisted <e> <s> it is likely that in some circumstances a mineral planning authority would very reasonably wish to amend the hours of working of a particular quarry <e> <s> in those circumstances i think it is right that modified compensation should be attracted <e>", "<cs> i hope my noble friend will not think me offensive if i confirm that his drafting is a little less than per cent <e> <s> indeed so much less that i did not fully understand what he was driving at until he rose to his feet <e>", "<cs> the definition of forestry at the top of page of the bill in schedule and moreover the scottish equivalent on page was in effect provided by the forestry commission and since it is they who have to be consulted on the terms of after-care conditions and on compliance with them i think it is right that they should provide the definition <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that either this amendment or its scottish equivalent is necessary or indeed desirable <e> <s> although we are bringing the removal of material from mineral working deposits under planning control this does not in itself alter the nature of minerals <e> <s> they still include all minerals and substances in or under land of a kind ordinarily worked for removal by underground or surface working and we would not expect different substances to be in a mineral-working deposit as defined in clauses and <e> <s> for those reasons i hope my noble friend will feel able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sure my noble friend will take heed of the request of the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> i will deal with the various parts of the noble lords supplementary question one by one my lords <e> <s> he talks about subsidised imports but so far there has not been the cogent evidence of subsidised imports that would enable the government to take the necessary action and it is to that end that we have set up this small team representing the catchers which we hope will investigate and report on the facts very soon indeed <e>", "<cs> my louis it is true as the noble lord alleges that the present strength of the pound gives importers a price advantage so far as foreign sources of fish are concerned <e> <s> i hesitate to go into the age-old argument as it is now becoming but we believe that the first battle for this country is against inflation and that as it is won and it shows every sign of being won at the moment interest rates will then come down and i have no doubt that in due course of time the pound will settle to its appropriate level <e> <s> to that end we hope indeed i am quite sure that the present price advantages which other countries enjoy will diminish <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i missed that question my lords <e>", "<cs> very little my lords because they tend to eat rather different fish from us <e>", "<cs> my lords the preliminaries were completed last week and the group is having its first meeting next wednesday afternoon <e> <s> no time has been given for its deliberations and with respect to my noble friend i do not think such a time limit is necessary <e> <s> as i said it consists of representatives of the catchers organisations and officials from the various agricultural departments <e> <s> they know only too well the urgency of the task and i am sure they will devote themselves to their inquiries as quickly as may be <e>", "<cs> my lords there are lots of cod in various different directions and if the noble baroness wishes to eat cod there is nothing to stop her except the depth of her purse but that is another matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord gladwyn was asking about exports of fish from this country to the european community and i said that by and large we did not <e> <s> my memory has now been jogged we have a healthy and indeed burgeoning export trade in salmon and smoked salmon and a small scottish firm has recently been given the queens award to industry but of course in volume terms that is a small quantity <e>", "<cs> my lords the basis of everything the government are trying to do at the moment is to establish a fair and equitable common fisheries policy which will enable our fishermen to pursue their traditional calling in a state of what i might call peace and profit <e> <s> all our energies are directed to that aim <e> <s> it really would not help either us or the fishing industry if we were to abandon our traditional stance of moderation and legality <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for that helpful supplementary question my lords <e> <s> i think the answer to both parts is yes <e> <s> as for the last part the whole question of subsidy and aid for other nations fishing industries is both complex and indeed fraught <e> <s> different countries aid their fishing industries in different ways and therefore i do not think this body would deliberate and come to any conclusions of fact with the speed with which we should like if we entrusted it with inquiries which were probably more appropriate for the department of trade <e>", "<cs> my lords i think my noble friend knows as well as the rest of the house the extremely firm stance which my right honourable friend the minister of agriculture has maintained throughout all the long and difficult negotiations and yes the various heads which we originally settled on as being appropriate and suitable for our fishing industry will be maintained <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord peart has finally sat down i think that before donning my ministerial hat i should declare an interest of which i think most of your lordships will be aware <e> <s> it is almost a year since the house had a most interesting and constructive debate on forestry on a motion by my noble friend lord dulverton <e> <s> that debate was so to speak a curtain-raiser for todays double bill and it is particularly fitting that my noble friend should have been instrumental at least in part in bringing this subject again to your lordships attention <e> <s> we are also indebted to the noble lord lord sherfield who provided the other motion we have been debating today on the forestry research report of the subcommittee of your lordships select committee on science and technology which the noble lord chaired with such distinction <e> <s> once again your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know <e> <s> i will write to the noble lord <e> <s> my noble friend lord cranbrook was concerned about hardwoods or broadleaved trees <e> <s> he said in effect that the hardwood reserves in this country are being destroyed <e> <s> what i can say is that first the annual yield is likely to remain at the present level for at least years and secondly the age-class distribution of hardwoods is very unbalanced <e> <s> about three-quarters of our hardwoods are more than years-old and certainly without a considerable planting programme the yield must decline in the next century <e> <s> so says my noble friend there is a need for an adequate financial incentive for planting broadleaved woodlands in the lowlands <e> <s> the answer is that the dedication scheme provides significantly higher planting grants for broad-leaved species that is per hectare compared with per hectare for conifers while the small woods scheme provides higher grants for planting small woodlands and these are usually composed of broadleaved species <e>", "<cs> my lords it might <e> <s> my noble friend lord bessborough asked about oak wilt and the importation of oak from north america <e> <s> he referred in particular to the dangers of oak wilt which is known to occur only in the united states being introduced here on oak imports from north america <e> <s> the possibility of the transmission of this disease on sawn wood is considered by pathologists in britain and america to be remote <e> <s> the bark which attracts the beetle is the source of risk and the import and export of trees wood and bark health great britain order requires bark to be completely removed before shipment <e> <s> in addition the wood has to be further treated by one of three different methods complete squaring drying to prescribed limits or disinfection by hot air and water <e> <s> the wood must be accompanied by a plant health certificate <e> <s> these measures are enforced by forestry commission plant health inspectors who aim to inspect each consignment of unmanufactured north american oak arriving in this country <e> <s> i hope my noble friend will agree that these measures turn what is already very small as far as risk goes into a matter of infinitesimal proportions <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i think it is very much better if the noble lord were to gain his information from the fountain of wisdom in this house and not rely on what happens in another place <e> <s> may i go on and then if the noble lord wishes to interrupt again he is at liberty to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords sales means sales <e> <s> sale and lease-back is a rose by another name <e> <s> it may be a very important one but it is still a sale <e> <s> within the broad objectives we have set we expect the commission to adopt the most sensible and flexible approach to sales <e> <s> this flexibility will also govern the method of disposal in individual cases <e> <s> the lease-back alternative to outright sale which was referred to in our policy statement will in appropriate cases help to ensure that access and recreational opportunities and wood supplies to industry are not disrupted and that employment particularly in those localities where the commission is the major employer is not unduly affected <e> <s> this is a matter to which the noble lord lord peart referred and i have myself met union representatives of the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to be offensive but i think the noble baroness is a bit muddled <e> <s> if the forest is more than five years old there is no question of a grant and i do not suppose that an investor who is looking for a reasonable return on his money not a quick profit but a reasonable return will buy a forest less than five years old <e> <s> if the noble baronesss point is that which was echoed by several other speakers how can we ensure that land which is in forestry remains in forestry <e> <s> then the forestry commission will not issue a felling licence without making it a condition of the licence that the woodland area is replanted after felling <e> <s> i hope i have dealt with that particular point adequately <e> <s> if not the noble baroness can <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already said in effect to the noble lord lord sherfield that we are not going to issue a white paper as at present advised on the very valuable report of his committee <e> <s> it may be that it was a mistake to tack these two debates together <e> <s> but since inevitably this would have turned into a debate on the forestry bill whether it had been described in the motion or not it was thought appropriate that the order paper should at least try <e>", "<cs> my lords i must thank both noble lords for the welcome which they gave to this bill a qualified welcome i think in each case and certainly in respect of the noble lord lord mackie a welcome which was tempered by the legal advice which he had apparently received <e> <s> i do not know from which country the advice emanated but the source was almost certainly male and dare i say <e> <s> chauvinist <e> <s> the chipping away if that is not an improper phrase of husbands and male rights in respect of property has been a continuing process now for a great number of years <e> <s> it may be that in the united kingdom and i use those two words advisedly we have been rather slow to give women the rights which for tens of years now have been accepted without question certainly on the continent of europe and more especially in the united states <e> <s> but i think that we are coming round partly by statute and partly by the way in which the courts interpret both the law and their duties to administer it in an equitable fashion to giving to women rights which as the noble lord lord mackie said were inconceivable only or years ago but which nowadays are regarded as the acceptable norm in a civilised and advanced western democracy <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am glad that the noble lord agrees with the philosophy underlying the bill <e> <s> i think that i should say in conclusion that this is really not so much a bill which interferes with or changes the law of property <e> <s> what it does is to give rights to people spouses of either sex who previously have not enjoyed them but more especially <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for setting the scene as it were in our deliberations in committee on this bill <e> <s> i think that as the bill is considered two matters will become apparent to the committee <e> <s> the first matter is that the government are prepared to be extremely flexible over quite large areas both as to the drafting and as to the way in which the various parties to a marriage will exercise the rights given to them under the bill <e> <s> secondly i think that there will be running through the bill a theme which will become apparent that in many many cases the interpretation of the bill when it becomes an act will be left to the courts <e> <s> that is something which i with my background find a wholly satisfying extremely just and equitable way of as i quite appreciate regularising what can be extremely unfortunate circumstances in which two parties to a marriage or two people who have been cohabiting together find themselves in disagreement <e> <s> from my previous experience which is now long ago in the divorce world i know that it can create more bitterness more upset and more lasting unhappiness than almost any other condition known to man or woman <e>", "<cs> i think that one should perhaps have regard to amendment no <e> <s> as well as amendment no <e> <s> because they both follow each other <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is seeking to change the drafting of the bill because he wants to have the matter stated in a negative manner rather than in the positive way which has been adopted by the draftsman in clause <e> <s> i am afraid that this is a battle of the draftsmen <e> <s> i appreciate that clause is complex but in my submission it is the concept that is complex and not the obscure drafting which makes it complex <e> <s> i appreciate what my noble friend has said but i am afraid that i can do no more than hold to the drafting with which i have been provided because i am informed that my noble friends two amendments do not make the subsection any clearer than it already is <e>", "<cs> in the interests of equality between the sexes which in other respects the bill scrupulously maintains i am pleased to accept the amendment <e> <s> furthermore i tell the noble lord that i shall move amendments to clauses and on report if he likes <e>", "<cs> i have a certain sympathy both with the noble lord lord ross and with my noble friend both of whom claim that subsection is not entirely satisfactory as it stands although they produce two very different remedies at opposite ends of the spectrum <e> <s> if a renunciation made by a spouse has been obtained under duress or by virtue of some undue influence exercised by the titled spouse and one assumes that it is most likely to be the husband in these circumstances then as i said on second reading legal remedies are available and no court will hold it against a spouse who has been induced to renounce her rights under such circumstances <e> <s> one must say that <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord lord ross has misunderstood the way in which the clause is set out <e>", "<cs> no do not grumble <e> <s> what it does is to set out the rights of a spouse in a logical and comprehensive manner <e> <s> in subsection <e>", "<cs> if clause were deleted then of course these words would be superfluous and i have already undertaken to examine clause and i therefore hope these words could fall to be examined in the same context <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord could certainly make his observation on the clause <e>", "<cs> the reason behind the words as they appear is that if they did not it would be possible to apply to a judge in chambers for an interim order to protect a spouses interests before the action was served against the other spouse <e> <s> the interim order in such circumstances would be granted on the <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i can help the noble lord beyond repeating what are the procedures in these instances <e> <s> the non-applicant spouse will have served on him or her a copy of the application and details of the time and place of the hearing <e> <s> that is as far as the applicant spouse need go <e> <s> if the non-applicant spouse does not attend or does not choose to play any part in the proceedings then it will be up to the court to make such order as it thinks fit but at least the non-applicant spouse will have been given an opportunity of meeting the case and that is the important part of the matter <e> <s> what i object to and what the government object to is the proposal that the procedures should be started without the non-applicant spouse knowing anything about them still less being able to defend himself or herself <e>", "<cs> i tried to explain that point earlier <e> <s> very often spouses go missing <e> <s> they become fed up with what i might call the matrimonial conditions <e> <s> in that eventuality all that is required is that the non-applicant spouses be notified of the hearing <e> <s> the court will fix the time for the hearing and the parties can prepare their cases <e> <s> if the non-applicant spouse chooses to ignore the notification or do nothing about it then he or she will have to bear the consequences <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to my noble friend but i really do not think that there is a difficulty here <e> <s> notice of the proceedings can be served on the non-applicant spouse in person or by post either at his last known address or at his place of work <e> <s> i also understand that the court can serve the notice by way of edict if the address of the non-applicant spouse is really not known <e> <s> as the bill stands there is no injustice towards either party <e> <s> the applicant spouse can obtain his or her relief while at the same time nothing can be done without the non-applicant spouse having the opportunity to defend himself if his whereabouts can be ascertained <e> <s> it is as simple as that <e>", "<cs> if a spouse renounces the right to apply for the possession or use of furniture and plenishings there will be no application to the court under clause and in that case the court should not be concerned with the renunciation <e> <s> it would be intolerable if not unnecessary for a court to act as a kind of filing system of renunciations in these circumstances <e> <s> if the renunciation takes place after court proceedings have commenced i am advised that court procedures will be able to take care of this situation <e> <s> i am saying to the noble lord that there is in fact no necessity no point in his amendment and i hope he will withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that the noble lord has tabled what is to him possibly drafting amendments which would improve and simplify the language <e> <s> i think the removal of the words non-applicant spouse would create problems in other parts of the bill since the reference in clause implicitly defines what is meant by non-applicant spouse <e> <s> furthermore if it was removed it would require a number of consequential amendments elsewhere in the bill <e>", "<cs> i am sure that having listened to the debate the noble and learned lord will now understand the conditions in which this bill came to be drafted and the way in which it is sought to get over if that is the word a number of difficult problems <e> <s> i particularly agree with what my noble and learned friend said that clarity is all and that through drafting one should try above all not to make what it is sought to be clear more obscure <e> <s> i respectfully agree with the noble and learned lord and would use the word his <e> <s> i am a titled spouse and most of those in this committee are <e> <s> i do not mind being personally labelled a chauvinist when it comes to the interpretation of statutes <e> <s> nevertheless the government feel that they have to tread very warily like agag in certain circumstances <e> <s> i think that we are going about it in the same way although the government are very well aware of the noble and learned lords strictures <e>", "<cs> the amendment would considerably widen the kinds of conduct which the court might regard as being sufficient to warrant the granting of an exclusion order <e> <s> at present the court must be satisfied that the conduct is injurious to the physical or mental health of the applicant spouse <e> <s> as the noble lord said by this amendment he seeks to extend this to include conduct which is likely to be injurious <e> <s> there is a belief that in its present form the clause requires evidence that physical or mental injury has already occurred to be given and that this evidence might not be readily available <e> <s> i concede as the noble lord lord ross said that the matter is by no means easy <e>", "<cs> if i may say so i think that the noble lord lord ross is under something of a misapprehension in the case of this amendment probably prompted by his dislike of tied houses and that has prompted the noble lord lord collison to spring to his defence <e> <s> i shall not say anything about tied houses in scotland and their desirability or otherwise <e> <s> what i shall say is that what this subsection does is to give the court a complete discretion <e>", "<cs> it is not wholly satisfactory that my noble friend moved amendments nos <e> <s> and together <e> <s> if i may take amendment no <e> <s> and hopefully dispose of that if amendment no <e> <s> which i intend to move in due course is accepted by the committee then such provides for any supplementary interdicts <e> <s> it will provide for an appropriate element of discretion on the part of the court <e> <s> i hope therefore that the noble lord will see fit to withdraw that amendment <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord and i agree that there could be circumstances in which a spouse against whom an exclusion order had been made might need to enter the matrimonial home for instance to collect something from it <e> <s> it would be absurd to require that spouse to obtain a court order to enable him to enter the home if the other spouse has no objections <e> <s> so what the bill therefore provides is that the other spouse can permit either entry to or the removal of an object from the matrimonial home <e> <s> permission to enter can be given verbally but consent to the removal of any item of furniture or plenishings has to be in writing <e>", "<cs> i would have hoped that the noble lord would have commented on if not covered amendments nos <e> <s> and which are government amendments and which i believe provide a reasonable and perfectly satisfactory compromise <e> <s> what the noble lord seeks to do is to deny the court any discretion in relation to the granting of a warrant or interdict sought to make an exclusion order effective <e> <s> i accept that without clause <e>", "<cs> i am tempted to say that with my noble friend lord selkirk on one side and the noble lord lord ross of marnock on the other the governments drafting is probably just about right <e>", "<cs> i shall resist the temptation to do so because i am being so gracious to everyone tonight <e> <s> what i do say to the noble lord lord ross is that his amendment has difficulties which he may not altogether have appreciated <e> <s> he is perfectly right in saying that it would greatly extend the areas from which the non-applicant spouse could be excluded by mean of an interdict and it could lead to such a person being prohibited from entering areas around the other spouses place of work or indeed the childrens school <e> <s> i do not believe this is a solution which would be favoured by the scottish law commission <e> <s> if this amendment or anything like it were accepted it would be necessary to define such areas very strictly indeed particularly if the spouses worked near to each other for instance <e>", "<cs> i really do not think the scottish law society would like to hear my noble friend talking in this way <e> <s> he moved an amendment which was specifically designed to fetter the courts discretion and as it were to preserve the non-applicant spouses freedom of movement <e> <s> here am i in effect moving an amendment which will give the applicant spouse all the protection that he or she could possibly need but which at the same time will have the effect that what i call an unreasonably sweeping interdict which might unjustifiably infringe the non-applicant spouses freedom of movement will not be available and my noble friend then complains about that <e> <s> i think that this really is quite a reasonable provision if one stops to think about it <e>", "<cs> had given notice of his intention to move amendment no <e>", "<cs> i think that the point is that on termination of the marriage different rights accrue and the courts will have different ways of preserving them <e>", "<cs> so far as timing is concerned it seems desirable that there should be as much flexibility as possible in relation to the timing of any consent <e> <s> if through some oversight consent has not been obtained it is i believe sensible that the oversight may be simply and immediately rectified so that the dealing may not be prejudiced <e>", "<cs> this amendment would provide protection to a purchaser of a home in which an occupancy right remained if the seller had made an attested statement that the property was not a matrimonial home <e> <s> normally this would arise where he or she was unmarried or divorced <e> <s> the effect would be to defeat the occupancy right if there was a spouse and the statement was false <e> <s> the spouse would in these circumstances

selkirk is going to move his next amendment which is amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> this seeks to ensure that the landlord is notified of any court order which transfers the tenancy <e> <s> the government accept that it is appropriate that the landlord should be notified of any change of tenant <e> <s> i am not entirely happy with my noble friends drafting <e> <s> if and when he does move the amendment i shall suggest that i take it away and consider the matter <e> <s> i hope that that will persuade the noble lord lord ross to withdraw his amendment too <e>", "<cs> where my noble friends amendment is defective is that it does not say who is going to serve the notice and neither does the clause as it stands <e> <s> that is what we have to think about <e>", "<cs> the tenants rights etc <e> <s> scotland act which conferred security of tenure on public sector tenants would have prevented such administrative transfers as the noble lord has spoken about but interim provisions

should emphasise that it was always intended that the tenants rights etc <e> <s> scotland act should merely deal in this field on an interim basis <e>", "<cs> frankly no <e> <s> i have explained that the tenants rights act which was enacted in contemplation of the scottish law commissions report and recommendations contained temporary provisions which were good enough while they lasted <e> <s> now we have an excellent system of transferring tenancies under clause of this measure and it is i suggest for the courts to regulate the rights as between spouses <e> <s> that is why we have courts <e>",

at once that the government are to reconsider the entire clause because as the committee will appreciate it poses a number of quite severe problems <e> <s> it was inherent in the proposals of the scottish law commission that a power of arrest should be attached to a matrimonial interdict unless the non-applicant spouse could satisfy the court that that was unnecessary and to that the bill gives effect <e> <s> my noble friend in his amendment seeks to remove the power of arrest attached to a matrimonial interdict which could be exercised by the police in circumstances where a breach of interdict appears to have been committed <e> <s> under the amendment of my noble friend reliance would have to be placed on the police powers to detain in the context that a criminal offence has been committed since that is the purpose of section of the criminal justice scotland act <e>", "<cs> my noble friend said that if i were able to satisfy him on the amendment that he moved amendment no <e>

arrest in any particular instance <e> <s> that is a very different matter <e> <s> if the noble lord is going to consider his position between now and the next stage i am sure he will want to bear that in mind <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i shall consider the matter before the next stage <e>", "<cs> what i undertook to do very simply and briefly was really in relation to two matters <e> <s> the first was in relation to whatever sanction is going to flow from a breach of an interdict which at the moment is dealt with under clause and which my noble friend lord selkirk was concerned about and in respect of which he had tabled a series of amendments <e> <s> the other matter which we discussed shortly was what happens when someone has been taken into <e>", "<cs> non-titled partner <e>", "<cs> i will deal first with amendment no <e> <s> under which the noble lord lord ross seeks as it were to ensure that couples are not to be said to have been cohabiting within the meaning of this bill unless they have been doing so for at least three years <e> <s> therefore to him cohabiting is defined by the length of the period they have been living together <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> it is somewhat obscure whether the noble lord means in one house in a number of houses in a lodging-house in a tent or whatever <e> <s> for myself and i am afraid this is the lawyer in me coming out again i think the courts are supremely able to estimate whether the conduct of two people is such that they can be held to be cohabiting <e> <s> i remember that when i used to draft divorce petitions i used to say living as if man and wife and that seems to me a perfectly reasonable way of deciding whether or not people are cohabiting whether they are living together as man and wife <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to my noble friend <e> <s> i am not sure whether his description of his effort is entirely appropriate for couples who are not married <e> <s> but certainly i will go into the matter before the next stage <e>", "<cs> if this amendment were accepted the court would not be able to consider the needs and interests of a non-dependent child that is to say a child over the age of who is living at home but working or attending university <e> <s> this lack of discretion would extend to most of the orders which we have been dealing with occupancy rights orders exclusion orders orders dispensing with the consent of the non-entitled spouse to a dealing by the titled spouse relating to the matrimonial home an order transferring the tenancy of the matrimonial home and and order delaying the sale of a jointly owned matrimonial home <e>", "<cs> i will certainly look at the definition <e>", "<cs> if my noble friends remarks emphasise anything it is that we are utterly dependent upon our courts to exercise a sensible discretion if such a situation should arise as the noble lord has postulated <e> <s> one cannot by means of a statute or even an enormous schedule setting out typewriters and aspidistras try to legislate between the parties <e>", "<cs> i cannot see the difficulties which my noble friend lord drumalbyn in particular seems to envisage but i will certainly look at it again in order to see if some difficulties are lurking <e>", "<cs> one would hope that the cohabiting couple envisaged by my noble friend would invest in a caravan or a houseboat rather than try to detach their colt house from the realty but i suppose <e>", "<cs> there certainly has been no delay in the introduction of this bill <e> <s> the commons only ordered the report of the law commission to be printed in july of last year and we are already at committee stage on the result of the bill <e> <s> bearing in mind the dust that some of these reports gather it is pretty good going <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord and the noble viscount for their support of the governments stance on the negotiations for a common fisheries policy <e> <s> it is of no little comfort to my right honourable friend when he goes to brussels or luxembourg month after month to know that broadly speaking there is a united front so far as the united kingdom is concerned <e> <s> i must also thank the noble lord and the noble viscount for their welcome of the very large injection of cash into the industry <e> <s> not for one moment do i say that the injection of cash is other than thoroughly deserved but it is a large amount of money and we hope that it will continue to keep the fishing industry in a position <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble baroness the question of the price of fish on the slab is rather outside the content of the statement that i have repeated <e>", "<cs> my lords the aid will be distributed on lines broadly similar to those in what is known as the fishing vessel temporary support scheme which we introduced last summer <e> <s> i can tell the noble lord very briefly that a cash sum will be paid for each vessel that can be shown to have been fishing on a regular basis <e> <s> the cash sum is determined approximately by the length of the vessel in the water <e> <s> though the scheme is slightly arbitrary it has commended itself to us as being the fairest that can be devised but above all it is easy to administer quick to pay out and seems to be effective in getting the money as quickly as possible out of the hands of the treasury into the pockets of the fishermen <e>", "<cs> my lords i think if i may say so that most of the questions that my noble friend has directed to me this afternoon might be better directed to me tomorrow afternoon when i hope to move the second reading of the fisheries bill which in the legislation so to speak will answer a lot of her points <e> <s> but taking the matter briefly this scheme is designed to put money into the very hard-pressed fishing industry as quickly and as effectively as possible so that it can as it were continue in effective being until we work out a common fisheries policy and can fish fairly and profitably in the way that it always has in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank noble lords and the noble baroness for the positive and constructive way in which they have taken part in this useful debate and indeed to congratulate them on the points that have been made <e> <s> i congratulate particularly those who were lucky enough to be here for my opening remarks <e> <s> i do not say that in any sense of pique towards those who were not here but if they had been they would have heard how i justified the bill in the context of a common fisheries policy as hopefully in the words of my right honourable friend it will become with the passing of spring <e> <s> it is of course extremely important and the noble lord lord ross put this so well that as the conditions have changed and changed for the most part not altogether for the better so far as the fishing industry is concerned then we must get our tack right so that we can continue to monitor both the fishing industry and the conditions in which it fishes and provide the best possible framework for the future <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the house my lords i fully understand that many noble lords object to this phraseology <e> <s> it is drafting that we are talking about <e> <s> if my noble friend says that he has no confidence in the flexibility of the government i hope that he has read the marshalled list of amendments beyond his own at no <e> <s> and seen if i may say so just how many amendments have been tabled in my name to reflect the very genuine and constructive matters which were put to the committee both by him the noble lord lord ross and other noble lords <e> <s> i hope it will become apparent that we have gone a long way to meet many of the valid and constructive suggestions which have been made in committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords with the repeated permission of the house i cannot undertake to take them out because neither i nor the draftsmen have anything in mind to put in their place at this moment today <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will think it is good enough for the government to undertake seriously to look at this matter of language and if possible to come up with a more acceptable choice of wording <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whither my noble friend lord selkirk is running with his amendment but certainly i do not regard it as being consequential <e> <s> i believe it is an amendment in its own right <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the only difference between my noble friend lord drumalbyn and me is that i deny that the word obtuse is the right or proper one in this context <e> <s> clause is the usual definition clause and i would remind the house that this was mentioned on second reading <e> <s> it <e>", "<cs> my lords i really must not do anything not to make the noble lord lord ross happy and therefore i shall not accept the amendment <e> <s> i am informed by the draftsman that in scotland the word respondent in relation to legal matters has a very narrow and technical meaning being used in connection with appeals and petitition procedures <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord fraser of tullybelton knows a great deal more about this than i do as indeed does the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside <e> <s> but that is what i am informed <e> <s> one comes down to the use of technical language and above all one tries to ensure that the words are clear and capable of being easily understood <e> <s> in view of what the noble and learned lord lord fraser has said i will make further inquiries between now and the next stage although the time is fairly short <e> <s> in that event perhaps the noble earl lord selkirk will withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the concern of the noble lord lord ross of marnock and what he seeks to do and indeed his reasoning <e> <s> however for the reasons which i shall give i do not think that this amendment is particularly appropriate <e> <s> first it attempts to deal simultaneously with civil and criminal procedure which could be confusing if for no other reason than that the standard of proof in civil and criminal procedures is different <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all i must point out to the noble lord lord ross that when he deprecated the fact as he put it that the new right is not available to people in tied housing that is absolutely wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords what this clause means is precisely what the noble lord lord ross wanted the court has a complete discretion <e> <s> what it says is <e>", "<cs> my lords in short the answer is that this bill has not altered from the draft bill of the scottish law commission on this point that is to say there is a higher right <e> <s> the bill will protect the wife against a contrived bankruptcy and that can be seen in clause but otherwise the ordinary law <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i did not catch what my noble friend said <e>", "<cs> my lords yes they must be <e>", "<cs> my lords consequential to my earlier amendments to clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i regard it as being quite properly phrased and indeed it is consequential to what i undertook to do <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave that is so <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> talks about a particular property and this is the property referred to <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly not otiose but i shall reconsider the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords it may help if i set out the position in relation to transfers of tenancy from one spouse to another where the local authority is the landlord <e> <s> prior to the tenants rights etc <e> <s> scotland act it is true that housing authorities were effectively able so to transfer a tenancy against the wishes of the sitting tenant <e> <s> it was necessary first to obtain an order for summary removal from the sheriff but this presented no difficulty because the sheriff was obliged to grant the order without any reasons being given <e> <s> under the act the authority must first give the sitting tenant a months notice of its intention to start possession proceedings and subsequently convince the court that it is reasonable to evict the existing tenant <e> <s> any action therefore falls to the housing authority which may be reluctant to undertake the necessary proceedings when this bill will enable the non-titled spouse to go directly to the court herself <e>", "<cs> my lords not for the first time the noble lord lord ross has put his finger on the spot <e> <s> the clause may now be too long and the draftsman is considering whether to chop it up and make it into two clauses so making it more comprehensible <e>", "<cs> my lords over the choice of phraseology i agree with the noble and learned lord lord fraser of tullybelton <e> <s> cohabitation by habit and repute is the only form of irregular marriage still recognised by the law of scotland and it is i am informed necessary that the parties have the intention of marriage and that need not be the case with persons who are simply cohabiting or living together <e> <s> the bill is intended to provide a limited protection to a non-titled partner in such circumstances even where there is no intention of marriage <e> <s> the amendment would remove such protection from all but a minority of cohabiting couples <e> <s> indeed this criterion is very much stricter than the period of cohabitation of three months which my noble friend was in committee inclined to regard as acceptable <e> <s> i do not at the moment propose to speak to my amendment no <e> <s> except to say that i think that this is another instance where it is perfectly right and proper for such questions to be decided by the court in its discretion <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to interrupt the noble lord but is he speaking to amendment no <e> <s> or no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords the basic view of the scottish law commission on this matter was first that there are no legal ties as there are in marriage so that the legitimate expectations of the partners should be less and as my noble friend lord drumalbyn has quite rightly pointed out the main purpose of the occupancy right for a cohabiting partner in this instance is to provide sufficient time to find alternative accommodation <e> <s> secondly it is right that the scottish law commission had second thoughts as to the form of relief that it wanted to give <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that one of the main justifications for the extension of the initial three-month period of occupancy rights in the house is to protect innocent children from suffering unreasonably from the breakdown in the relationship of the cohabiting couple <e> <s> but there may be other dependent members of the household there may for instance be an aged parent of one or other of the partners and i suggest that they too should be considered <e> <s> i certainly do not consider it desirable to fetter the courts discretion in this way <e> <s> normally courts will have regard to the presence or otherwise of children and i have no doubt that an extention will be granted less readily where there is no impediment to the non-titled partner finding and moving to a new address on his or her own <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a permissive part of the clause and not exclusive <e> <s> it may be that other relatives or people who are being looked after by one of the partners could be considered by the court when it has regard to all the circumstances of the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate my noble friends intention in moving this amendment <e> <s> however i am advised that it is not essential since by disapplying subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords i am again grateful to my noble friend but i do not think his amendment is strictly necessary <e> <s> if one goes to the earlier part of the subsection one sees that it reads <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate my noble friends concern about these matters <e> <s> if i say to him that it might have been better if we had dis <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble and learned lord for putting forward his doubts and in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e> <s> the most cursory examination of the bill shows that as its short title declares its provisions are indeed miscellaneous in character in that they cover a diverse range of matters affecting local authorities in scotland <e> <s> a second main feature of the bill is that it builds on existing structures and existing legislation although it does bring a fresh emphasis to certain existing provisions <e> <s> significantly this is most noticeable in the provisions dealing with the financial relationships between central and local government <e> <s> it is in times like the present when it is imperative for both central and local government to have regard to the needs of the national economy that the financial relationship between central government with its responsibility for national economic management and local government with its responsibility for the provisions of so many of our services has to be watched with particular care <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express my thanks to all noble lords who have taken part in this second reading debate coming as they have from several shades of the political spectrum and among some of whom at any rate there is very considerable experience of both local government and of central government <e> <s> not least i include here the noble lord lord ross of marnock who in his own allotted span as he described it was careful to extract the last ounce of party political juice from this particular lemon <e> <s> but i do not blame him for that <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said when i opened the noble lord proposed his rate support order and he was at the time concerned at the levels of expenditure <e> <s> he did not reign long enough to influence what he wanted but that was not to say that he was not concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords every year four times a year i think as secretary of state the noble lord sat down with cosla and argued the toss as to what their spending was going to be <e> <s> if the noble lord is saying that in all those meetings he did not try to influence the local authorities then i am quite sure that he or i must be mistaken <e> <s> i do not believe for one moment that the noble lord occupying the position that he did in st andrews house did not bring all his powers of persuasion to bear on the local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> the forestry bill is very short consisting only of four clauses and a schedule <e> <s> essentially it seeks to amend three sections of the forestry act of which consolidated legislation that began in with the inception of the <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness is going to start quoting me from the newspapers will she at least quote one whole sentence and preferably a paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords again i must interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> i said no such thing <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down since he was courteous enough to inform me that he would not be able to attend until the end of this debate will he accept that i have looked up the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank noble lords who have contributed to this debate <e> <s> some of them are extremely experienced in forestry matters <e> <s> the whole house will appreciate both in this debate and i have no doubt in later stages of the bill their collective and individual wisdom and the contributions which they will make <e> <s> i must also congratulate the noble baroness lady jeger on her first appearance at the front bench <e> <s> if i say that i agreed with almost nothing that she said and that her attitude to the bill possibly betrays a gap in her education over some forestry matters i know that she will not take it from me in any way which could be described as amiss still less meant offensively <e>", "<cs> my lords the forestry commission will continue its planting programme according to the grant in aid which it gets in the normal way <e> <s> i anticipate and again i can only peer through the glass darkly into the future that as a result of the sales one of two things will happen first of all in the medium term the forestry commissions plantings will probably to an extent go down as the private sector comes up but thereafter as the whole of the expansion of forestry proceeds in the way in which i outlined in my opening remarks the scale of planting by the forestry commission will again increase and hopefully at no cost to the taxpayer <e> <s> one of the matters which have been forgotten when talking about treasury raids and so on in the way lord ross has done is that one point of the governments future policy is that the forestry commissioners should be less dependent if dependent at all on the taxpayer which is merely another name for the money that is raised for the treasury <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord balfour for tabling these amendments because it gives us an opportunity to refer to the question of salmon and trout and migratory fish generally even though it is not the intention of the government that such fish would be within the competence so to speak within the control of the new authority any more than they were under the old white fish authority and i hope i can persuade the committee that this is a proper way to look at it <e>", "<cs> far be it from me to chide the noble lord the leader of the opposition but the minister would have considered even more carefully what the noble lord has said if it had been in the form of an amendment with a suggestion as to the course which the government might have taken other than the course that they are taking <e> <s> i say that humbly to the noble lord for whom i have great respect <e> <s> i say this because this particular question as to the form of the authority the number of members who should be appointed and their particular functions was exhaustively debated in another place i hope i do not say that too contentiously and indeed the eventual conclusion to which the other place came was that this was probably a reasonable way of solving what everyone agreed would be a difficult problem <e> <s> but certainly everyone was agreed that the arrangements would have to be different from what was originally contemplated as far as the white fish authority were concerned and that this is as good a way as any of retaining firmness of purpose and speed of execution with sufficient dexterity of manoeuvre to react to the changed conditions in which we find ourselves today and which have led to the establishment of this new authority <e>", "<cs> the matter was discussed in the other place as the noble lord has said <e> <s> as was said on behalf of the government in committee and as i am happy to repeat now we are by no means unsympathetic to the representations which fish farmers have made that they should become eligible for national capital grant assistance on a similar basis to agricultural farmers <e> <s> i understand the wish of fish farmers to be treated like other farmers and the governments sympathy towards the industry has already been illustrated at any rate in part by the noble lord lord cledwyn <e>", "<cs> i must have been expressing <e>", "<cs> and if my noble friend wants to put up a massive shed at the side of a put-and-take pond and expects to receive public money for it how is the matter to be resolved unless one goes into it fairly carefully <e> <s> i was addressing myself to the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos <e> <s> it would be very easy for me to say yes we will go away and think about this <e> <s> before the matter ever reached the other place it was considered <e> <s> it was considered very carefully in committee there and it was considered again before the report stage <e> <s> so it has had a great deal of consideration <e> <s> i fully accept the point which noble lords make particularly when in opposition i did it myself from time to time that governments have good intentions but that somehow they get sublimated by their own priorities and lack of time <e> <s> i can only point to the governments record in this field that we said what we were going to do over for instance matters which were legally quite difficult such as the derating of fish farms and did them expeditiously in a way which commended itself to the industry <e> <s> i personally do not like the cowards way out of saying to the committee that i will take it away and look at it when i know very well what government policy is <e> <s> it will only lead to the same debate possibly with an inevitable division on report <e> <s> that is a waste of the time of this house when it is in the middle of a very crowded session <e> <s> i have explained as best i can <e>", "<cs> i have no ideas above my station <e> <s> i must i am afraid leave the committee to take a decision on the matter with this final thought <e> <s> as clause is drafted it is a perfectly adequate way to give expression to what the government want to do in relation to this admittedly rather restricted community field <e> <s> if this amendment were to be accepted it would not provide a comprehensive logical basis for capital grants upon which any government could act and it would wreck clause in so far as it relates to financial assistance from community sources <e> <s> i repeat that the government are extremely anxious to help fish farmers to the limit of their ability in proper cases <e> <s> we do not yet know quite the best way of helping fish farmers maybe but we intend to find out as soon as we can <e> <s> i can only ask the committee to vote if it has to with its head and not with its heart <e>", "<cs> i think it is right that i should explain to the committee and this is the appropriate moment to do it that we are considering the need for amendment to this clause and to schedule which is dependent on it <e> <s> i should say that this is an england and wales problem <e>", "<cs> in his opening remarks the noble lord lord ross to quote his words i think either offered or proffered a grouse i did not quite catch which of the two it was and for one glorious moment i wondered whether he was offering or proffering me a dram produced in my own home town but the moment passed all too quickly <e> <s> if the complaint of the noble lord is that there has not been sufficient or proper time between second reading and committee stage i can but remind your lordships as i am sure the noble lord knows well enough that this bill was debated extensively in another place and that a great many of the amendments which we shall be discussing today have in fact already been the subject of very considerable discussion in another place <e> <s> so on behalf of the government i would reject the suggestion that anybody who wished to participate in your lordships deliberations has in any way been taken by surprise or in some way has been prevented from considering those points in the bill which interest them or in respect of which they want to give expression to their opinions <e>", "<cs> i have not said or implied any such thing <e> <s> what i have said echoing the words of my honourable friend in another place is that the government are undertaking a review and it may well be that in the light of that review it will be necessary to defer the next revaluation <e> <s> i cannot say more than that <e>", "<cs> i was going to interrupt the noble lord but as it is committee stage i can come back <e> <s> i am sorry <e>", "<cs> then i shall <e>", "<cs> the noble lord who in a very distinguished fashion occupied the chair which i did although it was geographically differently located in edinburgh knows very well or i assume that he knows very well that as far as consideration of this bill is concerned nobody has made any representations that i know of that this committee stage was other than properly timed <e> <s> i am not going to go into considerations of what happened in the usual channels but i have no doubt that if any such representation had been made i would have heard of it <e>", "<cs> even now the assessors are at work in the preliminary stages for the revaluation so that there is obviously need for an early announcement of the governments intention as far as the next revaluation is concerned <e> <s> i should point out that prior to the revaluation the previous administration had not announced their final decision to allow the revaluation to proceed until months before the due date so it does not of necessity take all this time <e>", "<cs> we did not have a public holiday in perth because we do not altogether agree with the premises upon which the noble lord and his government have based it <e>", "<cs> i entirely appreciate the spirit in which the noble lord has moved his amendment <e> <s> as he says it would require the secretary of state to consult the scottish valuation advisory council before postponing the revaluation <e> <s> i can tell him that so far as the revaluation presently due in is concerned my right honourable friend has already consulted the council <e> <s> i do not suppose that any secretary of state would dream of proceeding with the revaluation without consulting it <e> <s> if he did either because of oversight or through some worse reason that would be a legitimate matter for adverse comment <e>", "<cs> i am not going to discuss the merits of clause at this moment because we can do that if the committee is agreeable on clause stand part <e> <s> all i say is that so far as clause is concerned it is unnecessary to write the particular words which are the subject of this amendment into the bill <e>", "<cs> clause as is plain from the face of it allows the secretary of state to arrange for a partial revaluation in other words the revaluation of such class or classes of property as he may specify <e> <s> so that the object of the clause is to introduce a further element of flexibility into the statutory arrangements for revaluation <e> <s> in practice it is likely that if a partial revaluation were to be held it would contrary to what the noble lord lord hughes said be domestic property which was excluded from the normal processes of revaluation <e> <s> this might be necessary if a major reform of the domestic rating system were in prospect because it would be wasteful of effort and expense to require assessors to revalue houses which would shortly thereafter cease to be rated <e>", "<cs> the table of deductions in schedule to the valuation and rating scotland act is used to obtain net annual value from gross annual value <e> <s> the first column in the table comprises a series of bands of gross annual value while the second column shows the deduction or the method of calculating the deduction for each of these bands <e>", "<cs> i fear that the somewhat technical explanation will take rather longer than did the noble lords speech in moving the amendment <e> <s> the purpose of clause is to enable the secretary of state to make orders providing for the valuation by formula of operational property occupied by a passenger transport executive for the purposes of an underground passenger railway <e> <s> there is only one such railway in scotland at present in glasgow and so the clause has been included in the bill with the glasgow underground in mind <e> <s> so asks the noble lord lord ross why it is necessary to include in the clause a reference to the term railway as including a tramway undertaking particularly since as the noble lord was quick to point out there are no tramways in scotland still less any underground tramways <e> <s> but the reference is necessary for technical reasons <e>", "<cs> the purpose of clause is to allow the secretary of state greater flexibility in making appointments to the scottish valuation advisory council <e> <s> as the noble lord lord ross has quite correctly pointed out it does so by reducing the minimum number of nominees of local authorities from eight to six so that the effect again as the noble lord lord ross has quite correctly pointed out is that the secretary of state will be able to appoint between six and local authority representatives leaving the remainder of the total of places to be filled by others who must as again he said quite correctly include persons experienced in law or valuation <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ross was quite right there are <e>", "<cs> my understanding is that the balance is made up of experts in valuation which would i imagine include assessors and lawyers <e> <s> if i am wrong i shall communicate with my noble friend speedily <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is not right about that <e> <s> there is a scottish assessors association and they attend the council as assessors <e>", "<cs> they attend <e>", "<cs> i explained originally that the purpose of this amendment to the act was to give the secretary of state greater flexibility in making appointments <e> <s> that is no more and no less than the point of the clause <e> <s> in scottish local government was turned upside down if that is the right phrase but certainly it was reorganised <e> <s> the number of valuation authorities was greatly reduced <e> <s> at the same time the svac lost one of its original functions that of considering administrative schemes for valuation in each area <e> <s> that is what made a strong local authority representation particularly appropriate in those days <e>", "<cs> i had thought in fact perhaps in my innocence that the noble lord would move amendment no <e> <s> and speak to amendment no <e> <s> and that the purpose of his doing so was possibly to improve the drafting of the bill or more especially to point out that the provisions in the act which are referred to as among other things are not repeated in clause <e> <s> it now seems that we are coming on to a kind of clause stand part debate that is to say the noble viscount lord thurso and certainly the noble earl lord minto have both seized upon the amendment as an excuse and i hope i am not thought to say that offensively for saying that this clause is hateful to quote the adjective of the noble viscount lord thurso and needs extreme care in its scrutiny to quote the noble earl lord minto <e> <s> my noble friend lady elliot said that it is a thoroughly welcome clause which will be approved of by a great number of people in scotland <e>", "<cs> i could not agree less with what the noble baroness said <e> <s> in very many arenas the government are withdrawing from the local government scene and are in fact giving local democracy a chance to work much better with far fewer circulars and far less nagging interference from central government than were plain when the government supported by the noble baroness were in power and when i was a humble county councillor <e>", "<cs> this might be an appropriate moment to adjourn for dinner <e> <s> i suggest that we do <e>", "<cs> i must resist the noble lords invitation to join him in a debate on the attitude of the government so far as the maintenance of social services are concerned and the duties of local authorities <e> <s> all i will say to him is that it is my understanding that spending in real terms is up in this field and has been so ever since the government took office <e>", "<cs> it is not easy to know how to reply to the sort of debate we have had on this amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross was fairly generous with his allocation of time on some of the earlier amendments which covered a quite small compass <e> <s> he now moves five amendments together covering an extremely wide field to arguably one of the most important clauses in the bill <e> <s> he refers to his five amendments if at all in the most general terms and then passes to a general discussion of the merits of the clause which might have been more suitable for a clause stand part debate <e> <s> i do not complain so much <e>", "<cs> yes but the point is that they would not be able to incur the expenditure and so i say that we shall come to that <e>", "<cs> we shall come to that question it is not part of these amendments <e>", "<cs> again i am not going to go right into the background of this clause <e> <s> i think that i made the proposals clear when i moved the second reading of the bill <e> <s> local authorities have a role to play and indeed a very important role in the national interest to bring down public expenditure to a level that we can afford <e> <s> i paid tribute then and i have done so again today to the efforts of those local authorities which have responded responsibly and with good sense and which are trying to keep expenditure under control for the good of the whole nation <e> <s> but it is equally clear that others have not tried to do so or have failed to do so and they are jeopardising the national strategy to the detriment of their own ratepayers <e>", "<cs> and we are going to change the law <e> <s> the government have not as yet and my right honourable friend the secretary of state has not as yet come to any conclusion as to whether action is to be taken against any local authorities <e> <s> what the noble earl must realise is that this is a power to be taken if the secretary of state comes to that conclusion <e> <s> it is no good the secretary of state coming to a conclusion and then as he has now having no power to do anything about it <e>", "<cs> no i do not intend to give way again <e> <s> i shall deal with the point which the noble lord lord hughes made because it deserves an answer and i shall try to give one as best i can <e> <s> what should be realised and i am not sure that the noble viscount lord thurso realises it is that this is totally different from the act <e> <s> it is enabling the government to take action before the costs are incurred <e> <s> this is a very important point and goes to the root of what was said by the noble lord lord hughes <e>", "<cs> this amendment would remove the power which the clause will give to the secretary of state to calculate resources element according to a lesser rate poundage where an authority is planning to incur excessive and unreasonable expenditure <e> <s> a great deal of the argument in relation to this clause is precisely the same as the arguments i deployed in relation to clause on which your lordships have just come to a decision <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that the views of noble lords opposite and those of the government are totally different on the rate support grant provisions in the bill notably on when they should be brought into force and whether they should be brought into force <e> <s> as for timing which is what the amendment is about the government view is that it is essential that these powers which are contained in clauses and should be available for use in and on a number of occasions the secretary of state has made it plain in public that he would not have thought it necessary to introduce these provisions at all if in recent years <e>", "<cs> clause proceeds by reference to section of the act which reads <e>", "<cs> if it pleases the noble lord i shall undertake to look at it <e> <s> but i cannot see that accepting the amendment is going to improve either the language or the effect of the clause <e> <s> that is surely what the criterion must be when one considers whether one is going to accept an amendment <e> <s> if it will speed things up i shall give the undertaking but not with any real expectation <e>", "<cs> the question as to whether there is a need for a permanent standing advisory body on housing in scotland is one which we discussed less than a year ago when this house approved the abolition of the scottish housing advisory committee under section of the tenants rights etc <e> <s> scotland act <e> <s> i do not believe that the arguments have changed since we last discussed the matter and i must say that we have not received representations from any quarter calling for the re-establishment of the committee during the period since this matter was last under discussion <e>", "<cs> i think not because it would merely establish itself as a thoroughly cumbersome quango collating the work of other people and producing reports which some of these bodies very often produce at considerable expense with very little real edification to those who read them <e>", "<cs> the words which the amendment proposes to delete derive from the existing paragraph of schedule to the act <e> <s> it is surely not unreasonable for a borrowing power only to be available in circumstances where the expenses are of such a nature that they should be met by borrowing <e> <s> the difference is that in the new provision it is the secretary of state who should be so satisfied <e>", "<cs> the decision to abolish the committee was taken following the pliatzky review in <e> <s> it was considered that there was no longer any need for the scottish river purification advisory committee and that adequate advice as required could be provided by the river purification authorities themselves the scottish river purification boards association and professional officers in the department <e> <s> the decision was therefore taken and this clause gives effect to it <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to see this new-found alliance between the noble lords of the <e>", "<cs> if i may interpose now and i am very much in the hands of the committee as we all are as there are three amendments each rather different in the way it approaches this difficult matter it might be one idea if we had a general debate on this whole concept <e> <s> it may be that we shall come to some sort of conclusion whether final or pending i will not say at the moment and that might make for a more compendious debate and perhaps a neater one if we approach it in this way <e> <s> i am in the hands of the committee <e>", "<cs> each of them has its own particular drawback <e> <s> that is the trouble <e> <s> therefore i cannot at this time say that i have in mind a kind of <e>", "<cs> i have not given my objections <e> <s> i am not going to produce a preference until i have heard the arguments <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may comment on these amendments in reverse order to their position in the marshalled list because it is convenient to do so <e> <s> but by way of preface i should like to say that of course one cannot fail to be deeply impressed and indeed moved by the speeches which have been made to the committee this evening rather late and <e>", "<cs> certainly i shall consult with friends honourable right honourable noble and indeed learned <e>", "<cs> there are a number of questions here <e> <s> local authorities are currently responsible for unopposed tree preservation orders and we know of no case in which difficulty has been raised for private timber interests <e> <s> opposed orders which at present require the confirmation of the secretary of state are not numerous in there were in the whole of scotland and i have no reason to believe that placing responsibility for confirmation on the planning authority rather than on the secretary of state would significantly affect the interests of those who own the trees <e>", "<cs> i have already twice on second reading and tonight <e> <s> there is an appeal retained against the refusal by a planning authority to grant an application to lop or fell trees <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is being a good deal more hasty than any of these worthy bodies that he lists <e> <s> they have not as far as i know made their disquiet known to the government although they apparently have done so to him <e> <s> if he will be content if i say that i will look into it then i would be reasonably content at this hour of the night but the government have not had what i might call a chorus of protest at these provisions <e> <s> as i have said the forestry commission has given it its blessing but i will undertake to look at it again <e>", "<cs> my lords they are basically threefold <e> <s> in the first place police local authorities and local organisations have been asked to exercise special vigilance and of course customs officers and local government officials have the same powers of seizure as police officers <e> <s> secondly there is luckily considerable public awareness in the reporting of suspicious cases <e> <s> thirdly there are standard requirements that airlines and shipping companies do not accept animals without appropriate documentation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not personally aware of the details of this shaggy dog story <e> <s> i must say to the noble lord that so far as the customs and excise are concerned not all officers are taking part in industrial action but where they have done so customs and excise management have informed the police and other authorities of the situation so that they could react accordingly <e> <s> furthermore much of the industrial action has consisted of working to rule which in some respects can lead to enhanced rather than reduced checking <e>", "<cs> no my lords of course no one can be absolutely satisfied when a very important arm of our defences as regards the importation of animals is in dispute <e> <s> i do not have the statistics for animals in quarantine because they are outside the terms of this question <e> <s> but i have looked up the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot be more specific because the industrial action takes place on a highly localised basis from time to time so that such information does not lend itself to figures <e>", "<cs> i am very conscious of the feelings which have been expressed from all parts of <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble baroness it is not what she tells the committee it is a question of what people who come after all of us have to read into this bill <e> <s> so we have to try to get it right <e> <s> most of the forests are totally uninteresting except for those who wish to grow trees there <e> <s> i do not know how far out of the towns noble lords and ladies go but i have seen vast ranges of sitka <e> <s> if one tried to get into them one would merely injure oneself unfortunately <e> <s> if there are existing rights of way then nothing that this legislation will do will interfere with them <e>", "<cs> i believe there is a danger of going down a woodland path much further than this comparatively simple amendment justifies <e> <s> i have quite a lot to say about this when i come to speak to future amendments but what the noble lord will know from previous debates is that the way in which the forestry commission is expected to carry out its function which is the important function under this bill is not to sell woodlands which for a variety of reasons may not in fact lend themselves to sale in a particular instance <e> <s> this applies to the matter of such amenities as access <e>", "<cs> before the matter is put to a division perhaps i may remind the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> i think the less said about the last words in the amendment the better <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has already accused me of being what i think the americans call a bum lawyer and i do not want to foist my opinions such as they are on the committee <e>", "<cs> well i am grateful for that expression of support at any rate <e> <s> quite apart from the last part of the amendment i am afraid lackey or not that the first part is wholly unacceptable not least because of the difficulties which it would create for the commissioners in operating the disposals programme <e> <s> what the noble lord has done as he said is in effect to rely on the provisions of section <e>", "<cs> this amendment raises a constitutional point which is quite novel in my experience because apart from practical considerations what the amendment would do if it were written into the bill would be to give the forestry commission a power of veto over the sale of land belonging to ministers <e> <s> as a consequence the forestry commission could defeat the government policy <e> <s> that would be quite unpredecented <e> <s> i just wonder what would have happened in the days when the noble lord lord ross held sway in new st andrews house if he had wanted and he was answerable to parliament to do something which was within his powers but was told that he could not do it because he did not have the agreement of what in effect is a government department which is not answerable to anybody <e> <s> i think that the air would have turned blue <e> <s> that is what the noble lord is asking the committee to accept now <e>", "<cs> it is extremely important to realise throughout the bill that the forestry commission is not a quasi-autonomous non-government organisation it is to all intents and purposes a department of state <e> <s> it carries out government policy and advises forestry ministers in the way that any other government department does <e> <s> i hesitate to use the word mischievious but to describe the forestry commission as a quango operating on a semi-autonomous basis is totally removed from the facts as is evidenced by the officials who advise ministers on these matters and indeed fill the box when forestry matters are the subject of discussion in parliament <e> <s> i do not think i can say more but if it is the noble lords point that he is by the amendment introducing some sort of control over sales which is external to a government department then i emphatically reject that <e>", "<cs> obviously in many cases the purpose of an act is to define and lay down and if necessary confine the powers of the executive as carried out by ministers but that is not what we are talking about here <e> <s> we are here discussing an amendment which in effect is asking a minister to go to officials of his own department to seek their consent before he does something he wants to do and that i suggest is novel unconstitutional and undesirable <e>", "<cs> the ministers concerned act rather like a troika <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i ask him whether he is aware that at least in its own mind the forestry commission is to all intents and purposes a government department <e> <s> there has been discussion in the past on the point but i suggest that it is now recognised unequivocally as a government department <e> <s> the treasury and the treasury solicitor agree with that point of view <e> <s> the forestry commission does not answer to another department which it would if it were not itself a government department <e> <s> in other words it advises ministers direct in its own right as a department and it fulfils the functions of a department <e> <s> that it is a department is amply borne out by the fact that it has recently been included within the jurisdiction of the parliamentary commissioner <e> <s> so for all those reasons i cannot agree with the noble lord lord george-brown in his reminiscences of long ago <e> <s> the forestry <e>", "<cs> of course <e> <s> if i have got it wrong i will come back and tell the committee <e> <s> i will even write to the noble lord lord george-brown although <e>", "<cs> the noble lords remarks might have been expressed in a little more friendly fashion and that would have been more in the spirit in which this committee normally conducts its business <e> <s> i will go and do my homework again and if the position is not as i said it is i will tell the committee <e>", "<cs> i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord mcnair upon the very moderate way in which he moved the amendment and generally speaking the moderation which has been adopted by all noble lords who have taken part in the debate <e> <s> i am fully aware of the concern which has been expressed both inside the house and outside as to the provisions of this bill <e>", "<cs> if i may intervene before the noble lord lord mcnair speaks may i say that i have been very struck by my noble friends suggestion <e> <s> i have also been very struck by the reaction of the committee which i invited <e> <s> i do not conceal from the committee that i think that it will be a very difficult problem to resolve <e> <s> nevertheless in view of the way in which the committee has expressed itself this evening i think that it would be churlish of me not to say that i shall take this back and consult with my colleagues to see whether we can do something possibly on the lines suggested by my noble friend lord sandford which will have such form as will commend itself to the house at a later stage of our deliberations on the bill and thus effect a compromise <e> <s> i hope that with that assurance the noble lord lord mcnair might for this stage see fit to withdraw his amendment and let me take it away as i have been invited to do by the noble lord lord george-brown and see what i can do <e>", "<cs> i must come back to the noble lord lord george-brown on this matter <e> <s> the government came with a very pronounced view on this matter as i hope i made clear from my remarks <e> <s> i was invited to think again by a number of noble lords including the noble lord lord george-brown who said to paraphrase his remarks that i should take it away and do something about it <e> <s> when i say yes i shall respect obviously the concern of the house about this matter a matter of deep concern to a number of your lordships the noble lord then says oh no write it into the bill and see what the <e>", "<cs> i entirely sympathise with my noble friend <e> <s> i think that we would all wish to see land which the commission sells maintained in a productive way <e> <s> i think that the vast majority of purchasers interested in the mainly commercial plantations that the commission will be offering will wish to protect their investment by sensible management <e> <s> however i do not think that the additional word proposed in the amendment will ensure that this is achieved <e> <s> although the forestry commission by virtue of its felling licensing powers will be able to require that land remains under trees where appropriate it has no means of ensuring that a woodland will continue to be managed in a productive fashion after the sale takes place <e>", "<cs> i can deal with my noble friends point shortly by saying that if somebody wants to develop land in a way which is different from the use to which it is presently put he has to seek outline planning permission <e> <s> therefore all the various checks and balances would come into play which habitually do <e> <s> but that really is not the point of this amendment <e> <s> again i have a certain sympathy for the amendment in the same way as i did for my noble friends amendment <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord can perhaps he would like to tell me what he has in mind because i am conscious that noble lords wish to improve the bill <e> <s> if the noble lord has any ideas by all means let us debate them and then possibly they could come in the form of a government amendment or an agreed amendment at a later stage of the bill <e> <s> i am by no means adamant about anything in the sense that i refuse to look at the other persons point of view <e>", "<cs> for reasons which i have already touched on the first part of the subsection that is subsection is by no means acceptable to the government <e> <s> i have already touched on the reason but i had better do so again <e> <s> i think that the noble lord has borrowed if that is the word the words in section <e>", "<cs> with respect i do not think that a sales programme estimated at million in the first year is going to flood the market exactly <e> <s> may i just repeat what i have said at various moments and try to encapsulate it <e> <s> the commission will be in charge of sales <e> <s> i anticipate that the vast majority of these sales will take place by open tender and it would be a matter of the commission accepting or not the bid which most commended itself to them at the time when they had to make up their minds <e>", "<cs> it would be honest of me to say that it is more qualified <e> <s> however an undertaking is an undertaking <e> <s> some undertakings are given more wholeheartedly than others <e> <s> i hope that most members of the committee know that when i say i am going to do something i do it <e>", "<cs> this might be a convenient moment to adjourn the deliberations of the committee and the chief whip suggests that we reconvene at minutes past eight oclock <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> i well understand the desire of the noble lord to ensure that the special features of the forest parks designated by the forestry commission are maintained for the enjoyment of the public and i share that desire <e> <s> the first forest parks were designated before the second world war and could well be regarded as having set a precedent for the introduction of national parks in later years <e> <s> i know that the commissioners would not lightly dispose of land in the parks if there was any possibility that this would detract from the special features which have made them so popular <e>", "<cs> i agree <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> there is no mystery about this he has just got it wrong in his amendment <e> <s> it is what when i was a pupil at the bar was called idle drafting <e> <s> i do not make any further point than that <e>", "<cs> i do not think i can help the committee further <e> <s> i have tried to say that this amendment i appreciate the thought behind it is badly conceived and is already catered for in the arrangements <e>", "<cs> this amendment would really impose an unreasonable and dare i say in many cases unnecessary burden on the purchasers of forestry land <e> <s> foresters often erect vermin-proof fencing but they do so to keep the vermin out not to keep them in and when the trees grow out of the vulnerable stage they allow the vermin proof fence to fall into disuse since it is no longer needed <e> <s> i really do not think any purchaser would accept a burden of this kind and i do not think it is appropriate to impose one by statute <e> <s> i have to come back i fear to the same difficulties as we spoke of in previous amendments the difficulties of imposing a covenant and enforcing it on subsequent purchasers at least in england and wales <e>", "<cs> not in england and wales <e> <s> no covenants of this nature can bind subsequent purchasers <e>", "<cs> again i appreciate the motivation behind my noble friends tabling of this amendment <e> <s> but we come back to the same considerations as we have had in previous amendments and particularly the last one <e> <s> the clause is quite impracticable from the point of view of its legal effect <e> <s> while conditions of the kind could be attached to any sale of commission land they could not be passed on at least in england and wales to any successor in title to the original purchaser <e> <s> if one were trying to impose a restrictive covenant preventing the use of the land other than for forestry this would only run with the land if the forestry commission held adjoining land which would benefit from the restrictive covenant and in most cases of course this would not apply <e>", "<cs> i really cannot agree with a proposal which is apparently unenforceable and in any event only cosmetic in its intent <e> <s> if one is to have a power which is written into a contract of sale then it must be such a power that it can be enforced and my noble friend touched obliquely on this the resource implications for the forestry commission in seeking to carry out the work of monitoring what happens after the sale has taken place would be very severe <e> <s> i just do not think that the commission would be in a position to undertake that <e>", "<cs> i rather hoped that the noble lord lord davies would have said what the labour government were up to when they gave the forestry commission power compulsorily to acquire land belonging to the national trust <e> <s> but apparently his memory fails him on that particular point <e> <s> curiously enough this amendment is not so much defective as pointless <e> <s> if i correct my noble friend it is only for the sake of accuracy <e> <s> shortly after the labour government did their stuff i am told that in fact there was one case where land was acquired compulsorily under these powers <e>", "<cs> i do not know and i hope that it is not scotland <e>", "<cs> i do not think that even then the noble lord lord ross was in that gaumont british building old st andrews house so we need not worry ourselves too much <e> <s> the curious thing is that the amendment of my noble friend lord dulverton does not seek to abolish the power <e> <s> what it does is to replace one rather cumbersome parliamentary procedure with another <e> <s> that is why i say that the amendment is pointless <e> <s> the powers are obsolete they are not used <e> <s> the commissioners regard them as obsolete and at an appropriate occasion the commissioners will be happy to surrender them <e> <s> whether or not that happy occasion will be on report i am not quite sure but i will certainly take this matter away and think about it <e>", "<cs> having had a moment to reconsider the position to the best of my knowledge it does not apply to scotland at all so that this debate concerns only england and wales <e>", "<cs> may i interrupt <e> <s> the noble lord does not pay much attention to me but i have not yet had the opportunity of answering <e>", "<cs> i have some sympathy with the noble baroness lady jeger but i do not see what this amendment is going to do to prevnt what she calls speculation <e> <s> if a purchaser subsequently puts the parcel back on to the market there is nothing to stop the forestry commission from making a bid so to speak now if it wants to and one would imagine that this kind of property would be advertised on the open market in order to maximise the price to be realised <e> <s> if as i think the noble lord lord davies of leek was hinting there should be some sort of fetter on that subsequent sale so that the forestry commission could buy back the land at the price it sold it for i would say that that was totally unacceptable but at least it would be a point of view <e>", "<cs> the noble lord did not but he hinted at it <e> <s> but the amendment does not <e> <s> i do <e>", "<cs> i was interrupted <e> <s> if there is a joke it is a pretty sour one <e> <s> i do not think that the forestry commission should go about its business on the basis purely apparently of the nationality of would-be purchasers <e> <s> whether the purchaser is british or of some other nationality if he is able to pay the price look after the wood properly preserve the access and do all the things one would like such people to do then that is as much as one could want <e> <s> i hope that i have shown that while the forestry commission can impose a right of pre-emption there is no practical need for it and there is no equitable need for it <e> <s> if the noble lord lord ross now he has heard my explanation is still dissatisfied i ask the committee to reject it <e>", "<cs> we now come to the inner mysteries of conveyancing <e> <s> the answer to the noble baroness lady jeger is no except possibly in scotland <e> <s> in the old days in scotland a right of pre-emption did exist down through successive purchasers but to all intents and purposes that has now all gone <e>", "<cs> it may help if i first explain the reasoning behind clause of the bill <e> <s> all revenues received by the commission including those from the disposal of assets are paid into the forestry fund from which the commissioners expenditure is met <e> <s> until such time as the commission become self-financing these revenues have to be topped up through the grant-in-aid voted by parliament which is transferred into the forestry fund as the need arises <e> <s> however once money has been paid into the forestry fund there is no means by which it can be withdrawn or transferred except to meet expenditure authorised by the forestry acts <e>", "<cs> the forestry act lays down the forestry commissioners general duties and section provides that those duties shall include promoting the establishment and maintenance in great britain of adequate reserves of growing trees <e> <s> that duty was conceived during the first world war and included in the forestry act in order to ensure that in another emergency there were sufficient reserves of growing timber to meet immediate needs <e>", "<cs> this is a piece of tidying up that is to say the removal of subsection <e> <s> the powers have never been used at least not for a considerable time and certainly not since <e> <s> subsection which derives from the forestry act was designed for quite different circumstances to those now pertaining <e> <s> it was intended to cater for a situation in which the commissioners had significant funds standing to their credit for which they had no immediate need <e> <s> the commissioners present dependence on grant-in-aid voted annually by parliament which is drawn into the forestry fund as required to top up the commissions revenues from other sources means however that the sums standing to the credit of the forestry fund at any given time are not large as a measure of this the working capital that the commission is permitted to carry over to the forestry fund from one financial year to another is limited to <e> <s> this is not to imply that the commission will be able to keep any excess funds when it reaches a state of self-sufficiency <e> <s> i am sure your lordships will agree that when that time comes any excess of revenue over expenditure in the commissions amounts will after allowing for a reasonable working balance need to be paid into the exchequer in the form of a dividend for the large investment of public funds in forestry over the past years or more <e> <s> clause of the bill will permit this to be done <e>", "<cs> i think that the points which the noble lord lord taylor has raised really go very wide of this amendment <e> <s> this is not a question of tilt eventual use which is made of the money which comes from realisation of sales whether it is planted land or bare land or whatever <e> <s> this little used power in subsection as i have said has not been used since and if in the future the forestry commission is in a position where money comes into the forestry fund it will under this bill then be as it were taken back into the consolidated fund and the position will go on as before <e> <s> the planting rate will have nothing to do with this <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord taylor moved an amendment on precisely this point <e> <s> we debated it for i think about an hour <e>", "<cs> the thrust of the argument as it went to and fro across the chamber seems to have passed by the noble lord lord davies <e>", "<cs> as at present there is no fetter on the right of the forestry commission to sell its assets in the way which commends itself to the forestry commission <e> <s> noble lords have said at considerable <e>", "<cs> i am very conscious of the fact that the amendment reflects the views of your lordships select committee on science and technology which was so ably chaired by the noble lord lord sherfield and i am grateful to my noble friend lord bessborough for moving the amendment in an attractive way <e> <s> it is essential that forestry finds its proper place in the countryside and indeed the wider consultative arrangements introduced in are designed to ensure that full regard is paid to the requirements of agriculture the environment and nature conservation when forestry proposals are being considered <e> <s> these entail consultations with the agricultural departments local authorities and other bodies concerned with the management of the countryside and the opportunity is frequently taken during this process to modify the original proposal in order to secure better overall land use <e> <s> this usually calls for some compromise on the part of the various interests concerned <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe has said the forestry act provides that at least one commissioner shall have special knowledge or experience of forestry <e> <s> at least one must have scientific attainments and a technical knowledge of forestry <e> <s> at least one must have special knowledge and experience of the timber trade <e> <s> no specific requirements are laid down in the statute but since the eighth report of the estimates committee in the commissioners have consisted of a part-time <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i can clear up what is perhaps a misunderstanding <e> <s> of course i appreciate the concern of the noble lord lord houghton and many others on this difficult question of conservation <e> <s> clause is intended to extend to all cetaceans the protection which our law currently gives to sperm and baleen whales <e> <s> so it will ban the killing of such creatures as porpoises dolphins and killer whales <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment was one of two linked amendments which were made in another place as a result of points which were made and accepted by honourable friends of the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> in fact the words which the amendment seeks to delete from the bill in lines and of page are of a piece with the requirement in the new subsection b that the method of adjustment must be such as to preserve the pre-existing ratio of rateable values in each valuation area <e> <s> it was concluded in another place that this was the fairest way to proceed and that an all-scotland adjustment would risk inequity for the ratepayers in areas where the ratio of rateable values was significantly different from the scottish average <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave i do not think that i can help the house further <e> <s> this was something that was exhaustively considered in another place <e> <s> we are not talking about different methods <e>", "<cs> my lords the new subsection d which is what amendment no <e> <s> seeks to delete and amendment no <e> <s> which is consequential to it i dare say is an enabling provision nay more than that which will allow the secretary of state by order to repeal or amend enactments relating to valuation where that valuation is affected by orders made under clause and also to apply restrict or modify enactments relating to appeals <e>", "<cs> my lords i have some sympathy with the objectives and motivation on the part of the noble lord lord ross underlying his proposed new clause <e> <s> valuation is a complex subject and i accept entirely that the ratepayer who decides to take issue with his local assessor about the values which have been fixed has a difficult task in front of him if he is to pursue his appeal or complaint effectively <e> <s> this applies particularly to the domestic ratepayer who is unlikely to have the professional services of a rating surveyor or a lawyer <e>", "<cs> my lords i tried to say to the noble lord that that has now been repealed <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that one matter on which there is agreement is that this is probably the clause which is at the heart of this part of the bill and is of the utmost importance <e> <s> as the noble lord lord ross knows only too well the major aim of the bills provisions and in particular this clause and those provisions which the noble lords amendment would vitiate and i notice he had very little to say about his amendment in minutes of earnest endeavour is to give the secretary of state power to act effectively against overspending by an individual local authority <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment proposed by the noble lord has the apparently admirable purpose of improving the drafting not only of the bill but of the act <e> <s> but the effect of the amendment would be to add unnecessary words to existing statute <e> <s> the existing reference in statute which the amendment would modify is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am all for statute being clear and understandable to the reader and equally that it should convey quite clearly to the executive what the intentions of parliament were in placing the provision on the statute book <e> <s> but i have to say to the noble lord that his proposed words would in fact have the effect of adding unnecessary surplusage to existing statute <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment proposes that in being satisfied that a local authoritys estimated expenses are excessive and unreasonable the secretary of state be afforded discretion to have regard to other authorities of a similar type in place of the discretion presently in the bill to have regard to closely comparable authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has produced two examples which are incomparable <e> <s> there is no other region like strathclyde and no local authority of any sort let alone a district which is like glasgow <e> <s> what this provision does not do is to force the secretary of state to do the impossible to make comparisons where it is not possible or justified but it enjoins him to seek to draw the fairest possible comparison that he can and then to make his judgment <e> <s> i anticipate that it will far more frequently apply to district councils than to a region <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords amendment refers to section <e>", "<cs> my lords i was interested in what the noble viscount lord thurso with his long experience of local government had to say on this matter <e> <s> i suggest that the apparent <e>", "<cs> my lords what clause does in effect is to give local authorities which budget for excessive and unreasonable expenditure a way of avoiding the reduction in grant which might otherwise follow <e> <s> effectively by enabling authorities facing the possibility of a cut in grant to reduce their rate poundage in the course of a financial year it gives them the choice of either giving the money back to their own local ratepayers or returning it to the exchequer <e> <s> the government hope that authorities will have regard to the interests of their ratepayers and will follow the former course and we aim to remove as far as possible any difficulties which statutes might place in the path of an authority which decides to redetermine its rate <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ross moved and spoke to an amendment in committee which was similar to if not identical with this amendment <e> <s> i have listened for any new argument that the noble lord might deploy to titillate the house to take a fresh view of the matter but i did not hear any and i am certainly not going to weary your lordships by rehearsing all the arguments that i deployed on the last occasion <e> <s> the ground has been well covered already <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment has the objective of requiring the secretary of state to estimate the relevant income simply by increasing the income amount estimated by him for the previous year by an amount reflected only by the rate of inflation and not necessarily having regard to the communitys <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment has very considerable implications <e> <s> i must do justice to the amendment and to the manner in which the noble lord has moved it <e> <s> i say that not by way of a threat but more as a promise that i shall have to take a little time <e> <s> in moving the inclusion of this new clause the noble lord lord ross of marnock has raised a matter that as he said has unhappily been assuming considerable importance and occasioning much concern in certain areas of scotland in recent months <e> <s> the problem of controlling public processions in the interests of preserving public order is not an issue that has greatly exercised scottish local authorities in the past for until comparatively recently we have been spared the disturbances the controversy and the violence that have from time to time accompanied processions of one kind or another in various parts of england mainly but not exclusively in london <e> <s> that happy position has shown signs of changing and of late we have seen several marches or proposed marches in glasgow and elsewhere which have posed a real threat to the maintenance of public order <e> <s> this is therefore a matter of considerable concern to government and local authorities alike and it is obviously something which will have to be corrected in due course <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate very much the purpose behind this new clause and certainly there is an advantage in local authorities co-ordinating their policies and actions on the question of access for the disabled <e> <s> but there are two main arguments against making it a statutory requirement to appoint access officers <e> <s> first it runs against current scottish local government legislation which in general deliberately leaves the authorities themselves to determine the pattern and structure of their organisation in the light of their particular circumstances and needs <e> <s> secondly in the present financial climate we think it would be wrong to impose on local authorities the requirement to designate staff as access officers because of the possible expenditure implications and the designation of a statutory access officer may not in any case be the best means of promoting the needs of the disabled <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much hesitate to interrupt my noble friend but if he had been listening he would have heard two speakers in this debate the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth and me say that in fact in nearly all cases they have been appointed <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i say that those who have followed the proceedings this evening will have seen that this is a starred amendment on the marshalled list <e> <s> this means that the government have had very little notice of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank noble lords and indeed noble baronesses for their welcome to this new clause <e> <s> may i say to the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside that nobody is churlish with more charm than he <e> <s> a lot of the questions that have been asked of me will be the subject of the wide-ranging consultations with all manner of interested parties that we shall have before my right honourable friend comes to determine the content and form of the regulations which will be published in due course <e> <s> i think that the noble baroness lady masham asked me five questions <e> <s> most of them will be the subject of these consultations but what i shall do in respect of both her questions and those that others have asked me is to look at the <e>", "<cs> my lords as was explained in another place when the same proposal was put forward it has been given very careful consideration because it is recognised that development corporations are public bodies spending large amounts of the taxpayers money <e> <s> however after the most careful consideration my right honourable friend having met the chairmen of the development corporations on th march wrote to them to say that he did not propose to direct them to open their meetings to the press and public as he recognised that the bulk of their business was of a commercial confidential nature and that there was a serious risk that fears of breach of this confidentiality might detract from the attractiveness of the new towns especially in their important role of creating employment opportunities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sympathetic to the motives underlying the noble lords moving of this amendment <e> <s> these matters were fully ventilated during the discussions in another place and as the noble lord has quite rightly said the matter is still the subject of an action in the sheriff court and it is now unlikely in fact that the outcome will be known until october <e> <s> but we remain of the opinion that it would be prudent to assess the situation in the light of the courts judgment <e> <s> if the courts decision makes clear that an amendment of the act is necessary then we shall take steps to give effect to this at an early opportunity <e>", "<cs> the early adjustment of existing legislation along lines as modest as those which are before us will i believe do much to preserve and enhance the recognition and respect by farmers landowners and those seeking recreation of one anothers interests in this most important element of our national heritage the countryside of scotland <e> <s> i have no doubt that with the noble lord lord ross of marnock sitting opposite the bill will be subjected to a fairly rigorous committee and possibly report stage <e> <s> no doubt we shall go into the problem of noise in the countryside and whether or not a helicopter on a scheduled service should cause any even when it is bringing undoubted mobility and very great benefit to the people who live in the highlands and islands particularly in the vicinity of fort william <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may respond to those two speeches from the front benches first <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross alleged or certainly implied that my right honourable friends statement and the action which the government have been reluctantly impelled to take in this matter are bringing the responsibility of local authorities to an end and that in effect local authorities are being denied judgment to make decisions about local affairs <e> <s> i think one has to keep a sense of proportion in this <e> <s> ever since this government came to power my right honourable friend on what might be described as a quarterly basis has made no secret of his dismay at the spending plans of local authorities and has told them they are too high and that the country simply could not afford them <e> <s> when one considers that no less than two-thirds on average of every pound which local-authorities spend comes from the pockets of the tax payers through central government it is a negation of function for government simply to turn a blind <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not happily privy to what went on in the scottish office before the latter part of may <e> <s> but we all know that there has been discontent with the rating system probably throughout the th century <e> <s> it has been getting more and more unfair and more and more unsatisfactory as the increasing complexity of our business economic and social life has as it were disturbed the balances between domestic and industrial or commercial properties which have to pay rates <e> <s> nevertheless i think that things have moved with a good deal greater speed in the last two years than they have before <e> <s> we have been actively considering how we can remedy the present totally unsatisfactory and unfair system <e> <s> there will be a discussion paper in the autumn and i hope that when it comes out the noble and learned lord will read it and no doubt will have a part to play in future discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords there will obviously be a continuing dialogue between my right honourable friend the secretary of state and local authorities <e> <s> but i would remind the noble lord lord galpern that in order to produce rate support grant my right honourable friend has to be satisfied and indeed has to satisfy the house of commons that the expenditure plans are not excessive and unreasonable <e> <s> that i think is the criterion which we should have very much in the forefront of our minds <e>", "<cs> my lords we as opposed to us are not going to see that in the content of a <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether i am in order in welcoming the noble lord lord bishopston to the dispatch box whether i am <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> nevertheless i am sure that <e>", "<cs> my lords it is usually not necessary on a debate such as this for the minister to reply but i think i should in this important debate for two reasons <e> <s> first and shortly to thank noble lords and noble baronesses especially those who are disabled for the kind words that they have said <e> <s> there has been a considerable effort by a number of departments in government to achieve something that would improve this bill and i am glad that they have acknowledged that fact and that we have been able to do something which i think in the years ahead will possibly be regarded as a milestone <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin by thanking my noble friend lord sandford most warmly and indeed sincerely for his very sustained and ingenious way of trying to reconcile a number of doubts which noble lords have had about this bill and i shall come back to that <e> <s> secondly may i say to the noble lord lord mcnair that i shall not follow him down the byways of the forest of dean <e> <s> i have written to him twice within the last few days <e> <s> i hope that he has received both of those letters i see that he nods and that both in their different ways will have brought joy to him as well as to those whose cause he has espoused <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord about amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> is he taking that now or later <e>", "<cs> certainly not <e>", "<cs> it is mansfield in nottinghamshire <e>", "<cs> the second one is mansfield in middlesex <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever the noble lord lord ross of marnock may claim the purpose of these amendments is to constrain the disposal powers in the bill <e> <s> he begins by excluding totally the open-ended power in clause <e> <s> the amendment leaves in being the whole of the existing disposal powers in section of the forestry act and then he goes on to add a new subsection <e> <s> the amendment looks to the provisions of section <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who does not come from the forest of dean nor proceeding in a northerly direction from middlesex nor nottinghamshire nor even from morayshire but originally from moravia a descendant of a pirate who is alleged to have raped macbeths daughter i think i can take a view on this somewhat chauvinist amendment in the same way as the noble lord lord ross <e> <s> we are happily still in the united kingdom and this is a united kingdom bill <e> <s> it says and makes provision for what the government are to do through their forestry ministers of whom there are three in different parts of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will recollect that we had a good and indeed full debate on this amendment in committee <e> <s> i agreed to consider what we might do to reflect the mood of your lordships at a later stage of the bill <e> <s> the noble lord put his amendment down again and i wrote to him <e> <s> i hasten to say that there was no criticism in my remarks that he had not acknowledged my letters <e> <s> i was merely concerned because i particularly wanted him to get the first letter in order to save trouble and expense to those of his supporters who in one connection or another might want to attend the house <e>", "<cs> my lords once more the noble lord lord ross is going back to section <e>", "<cs> not yet <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i may have done my noble friend a disservice to the extent that when i came to prepare for this stage of the bill it seemed to me that my noble friends amendments overlapped rather less than has subsequently transpired <e>", "<cs> my lords i was going to say before the noble lord lord mackie spoke that my noble friend lord dulverton had shot my fox but in fact the creature limped out of its burrow <e>", "<cs> but i as a scot can thank him for apparently doing it for me <e> <s> that is the point <e> <s> however my lords the creature has limped on its way through the mouth if that is right of the noble lord lord mackie <e> <s> i am not going to go back to the old saw about this being a treasury bill <e> <s> the short point is that the disposals programme is going to be chosen and carried out by the forestry commission <e> <s> ministers will only come into it in a way which ministers do come into these things at a somewhat advanced stage <e>", "<cs> my lords we had a good debate in committee on this subject <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross i think moved a very similar amendment <e> <s> this amendment is rather less specific than the last <e> <s> it does not for instance define crown woods but i do not complain about it for that reason <e> <s> the crown woods in question are of course those that were transferred to the custody of the forestry commission under the forestry transfer of woods act and orders which have been made under the act <e> <s> there are a large number of these areas up and down the country but the two most famous and most significant areas are the forest of dean and the new forest <e>", "<cs> my lords before i go into the merits or the lack of them of this amendment i must say on behalf of the government that if the noble earl lord wemyss and march has been shown any discourtesy or slowness on the part of anybody in answering his letters i take full responsibility for that and apologise to him <e> <s> one of the difficulties was that we were all waiting to see what happened in committee to the amendment which lord taylor of gryfe tabled but was unfortunately not here to move <e> <s> i do not suppose the fact that the bill moved in its passage from the other place to this house from the ministry of agriculture to the scottish office has helped communications all that much <e> <s> but i am bound to say that i tried very hard to contact the noble earl even considering at one moment approaching him at his dentist <e> <s> perhaps he will be relieved that i desisted <e>", "<cs> my lords i think exactly the same considerations apply as have applied to our debates all along <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble baroness has been in her place for some number of hours now <e>", "<cs> my lords a fresh mind and i will not say an untutored mind for that would be very rude but an uninformed mind in the context of this debate <e>", "<cs> this is sensible my lords <e> <s> the clause removes from section of the forestry act the power compulsorily to purchase land held inalienably by the national trust and the national trust for scotland <e> <s> what we have done in respect of the last amendment which was pressed to a division was not to write into the bill a badly drafted and technically inadequate amendment which would not have done what the noble lord lord gibson and dare i say it the noble earl lord wymess and march <e> <s> would have wanted <e> <s> this is as i understand it precisely what the national trust wants and therefore there is that distinction <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the noble lords concern in this matter and if i thought that the dangers were real i should feel differently about his amendment than in fact i do feel about it <e> <s> a right of pre-emption of the type which the noble lord suggests is i think quite unnecessary <e> <s> if properties which have been sold under the provisions of clause of the bill are subsequently offered for resale it is reasonable to assume that they will be advertised on the open market <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords will recollect that during the committee stage i undertook to consider an amendment which was moved and withdrawn <e> <s> i think my words were that i undertook to <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not altogether easy at this stage of the bill to know how to reply politely and constructively to the noble lord lord molloy who i think made his maiden speech about a week ago <e> <s> how far he has followed the proceedings of this bill i know not <e> <s> what i can tell him is that it has had full consideration in both houses of parliament and ministers and i have responsibility in this particular direction under the secretary of state for scotland have given very full consideration to a great number of different matters which have been brought to our attention both within and without the palace of westminster <e> <s> that i think has been particularly reflected in the guidelines which are now in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank both noble lords for their welcome of the statement <e> <s> perhaps i may put the remarks of the noble lord lord ross in their right context by saying that the government believe there is nothing fundamentally wrong with the present structure of local government in scotland <e> <s> what my noble friends committee was asked to inquire about and the basis on which it produced its report was that it was the operation of the structure that was to be inquired into and i suggest that it has done a thorough and workmanlike job <e> <s> as for the conclusions to which it came in relation for instance to the four cities and indeed to two of the former counties such as argyll and i think it was moray to which the noble lord referred my right honourable friend and the government agree with those conclusions of the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no question of the government not as it were taking any action to implement in the main the conclusions and determinations of this committee and i thought the statement made it plain indeed it has been made very plain in your lordships house on a number of occasions during this session that in all probability legislation will be introduced which will put a large number of the conclusions and recommendations into legislative form <e> <s> i regret that i am not in a position to give the noble and learned lord a comprehensive answer on the question of community councils at the moment but if he will be content with such a course i shall write to him as soon as may be <e>", "<cs> it may help if i give the governments view on this amendment at this point <e> <s> i entirely agree with the motivation behind the amendment <e> <s> as the noble lord lord ross has said the commission in its annual report which it publishes already includes full details of all grants which are paid including the identity of the recipient the purpose and the amount of the grant and that the commission is enjoined to do under section of the act <e>", "<cs> i am informed that no loans have been made <e>", "<cs> to all intents and purposes this amendment applies to the preparation of maps <e> <s> i entirely agree with the noble lord lord ross that as the policy of the government has shown statutory powers should devolve to local authorities to exercise these functions where it is logical rather than that the functions should remain with central government <e> <s> that is a concept with which i entirely agree <e> <s> if the noble lords purpose is to reconcile local authorities with the commission or some desire of that nature which quite obviously he would like to do for instance in his amendment to clause which goes into rather different and more serious matters then that might be one way of doing it <e>", "<cs> this amendment is directed at arrangements entered into by virtue of the imposition of capital transfer tax and therefore it is perhaps appropriate that i should reply to the noble lord at this stage <e> <s> the government attach a great deal of importance to the preservation of land of outstanding scenic beauty and the government seek to ensure that where there is an exemption from capital transfer tax in respect of such land there should be reasonable access for the general public to enjoy it <e> <s> this is not by any means the first government to take that view because it was the administration of which the noble lord lord ross was a member which first imposed capital transfer tax in and the finance act which introduced various tax exemptions and also drew up the arrangements under which land of this nature would qualify for exemption <e>", "<cs> it was i fancy <e> <s> under these arrangements which are laid down by the treasury the capital transfer office first of all seeks the advice of the countryside commission as to whether the land can be considered of exceptional scenic value at all and if it can be so considered its advice is sought as to the management and access arrangements which should apply <e> <s> then the procedures provide for the local planning authority to be consulted about the arrangements and these arrangements are then promulgated so to speak so that they are known both to the local authority and to the local public <e>", "<cs> oh <e>", "<cs> it may be helpful if i give the governments reaction to this amendment and indeed the one that follows because they are both tied up as the noble lord lord ross has already implied with the governments conclusions about the stodart report <e>", "<cs> i do not want to interrupt the noble lord but i wonder if he is right when he repeats that a local authority according to his wishes could only make by-laws as respects land in an area belonging to them <e> <s> the second part of subsection says <e>", "<cs> the noble lords amendment quiet areas of the countryside means that the planning authority can make any by-law on this question in any quiet area of the countryside <e> <s> i am wondering whether he sees <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank noble lords who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> their reactions in some cases have been predictable in others perhaps less so <e> <s> for instance i was very interested to learn how the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside would view the assisted <e>", "<cs> my lords my choice of phrase is grudging approval <e> <s> if the noble lord does not think that his words amounted to that i shall not complain <e> <s> why is the legislation needed <e> <s> the noble lord asked <e> <s> unfortunately the situation in scotland is perhaps not quite so rosy as the picture which the noble lord paints <e> <s> the proportion of appeals granted for instance in lothian has been going down as the school rolls decline not as one might imagine up <e> <s> the fact is that per cent <e> <s> of the requests received for the session were refused per cent <e> <s> of those for the session were refused almost one-third and my right honourable friend the secretary of state has received a large number of representations from individuals objecting to lothians policy <e> <s> it is also fair to speculate at least as to how many parents do not bother to apply because they do not expect to succeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this was an amendment which the noble lord did not move in committee i say that because i was not too clear as to why the noble lord intended to move it now until he rose to his feet <e> <s> i think that the noble lords concern is perhaps a little misplaced <e> <s> the provenance if that is the word for this procedure is entirely respectable and in fact it is taken from section of the town and country planning scotland act which deals with tree preservation orders and which has the same <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think they will sell cheap <e> <s> i think they will sell by tender to the highest bidder and if the bid does not come up to the expectation in the good old scottish manner they will not sell <e> <s> i take issue with the noble lord about that <e> <s> if he thinks these woods are going to be sold off cheap to raise the odd bob or two and the noble lord lord ross i am sure knows much more about woolworths than i do he is wrong it is not going to happen that way <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think my tenants would agree with the noble lord and they would i hazard know a bit more about it than he does <e> <s> nevertheless where such a sale as this takes place the obvious purchaser is the tenant <e> <s> he must be <e> <s> it is equally obvious that he is not going to give a vacant possession price because he has security of tenure <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord accepts that <e> <s> so if there is a sale under these circumstances by the forestry commission quite obviously it will not seek and it will not obtain the vacant possession price <e> <s> there has to be a discount on the full vacant possession market price that is what would happen and that is what does happen <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i shall respond and first thank noble lords and the noble baroness for their kind words <e> <s> secondly the noble lord lord mcnair asked me two questions <e> <s> he asked what was the difference between his amendment and the government amendment <e> <s> i can tell him that it is a difference of drafting <e> <s> the mysteries of the draftsmen are quite beyond me and i shall not try to explain unless he really wants a technical explanation and i can see him shaking his head <e>", "<cs> my lords we had a good debate in committee on this issue <e> <s> we had precisely the same amendment moved on report by the noble lord lord bishopston who smartly withdrew it after my explanation <e> <s> now once more the noble baroness lady jeger has raised the same amendment yet again <e> <s> far be it from me to pronounce upon the <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect it is not really a question of whether the noble baroness feels it right to have yet another debate <e> <s> it is whether it is an abuse of the processes of the house <e> <s> i say that this very nearly is <e>", "<cs> nevertheless the amendment has been put down it has been moved and i must deal with it <e> <s> may i first of all turn to the crown woods where the noble baroness refers to the old crown woodlands transferred to the forestry commissioners under the forestry transfer of woods act <e> <s> she may have in mind the noble lord lord bishopston certainly did various other areas which are held on lease from the crown estate commissioners <e> <s> i said on the last occasion that the expression crown woods in this context is imprecise and it is as imprecise now as it was then <e>", "<cs> may i first deal with the point as to the construction of the bill <e> <s> i have no doubt that those members who have knowledge of these matters will know and appreciate that the bill owes a lot to the distinguished committee which was chaired by my noble friend lord renton <e> <s> i for one appreciate that at first blush when one comes to look at a bill such as this it reads somewhat differently to what one has been brought up to read <e> <s> it could be said that it is more difficult to understand at first reading <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will listen he can of course come back in a few seconds but <e>", "<cs> yes i think the noble lords hearing was perfectly accurate on this occasion <e> <s> but let me clear up one other possible confusion <e> <s> the deletion of these maximum roll provisions by the government does not mean that the authorities will be prevented from calculating maximum rolls or intakes from the schools but it does seem that the fact that a maximum roll had been reached will not be a legitimate ground for refusal of a placing request under the new clause a and authorities may continue to calculate such maximum rolls informally as part of their administrative arrangements and planning <e> <s> they may well indeed be of assistance to parents who are considering the likely availability of places in a school <e> <s> therefore i reject the claim by the noble lord lord ross that education authorities will not be able to plan ahead <e> <s> what this amendment in another place meant was that they can plan ahead just as well and just as easily as they could before but as i said it will remove a possible rather unfortunate let-out for an <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord ross for raising this matter <e> <s> of course my right honourable friends letter which was dated th april accompanied a decision on the transfer scheme which had been the subject of an intense debate and a great deal of negotiation as between lothian and the scottish education department <e> <s> it is only indirectly connected with this particular provision <e>", "<cs> i am sure the noble lord would not expect me to go into the details of what has yet to be worked out <e> <s> as i have tried to say this is a matter upon which there is quite intense controversy as between those on the one hand who say that the proposals in the consultative paper are far too wide and those on the other hand who say that they are rather too narrow <e> <s> the government have to steer a course doing the best they can between the differing points of view <e>", "<cs> first i should like to deal with the personality part of this <e> <s> of course junior ministers in the scottish office are indeed mortal some secretaries of state run through more junior ministers than others <e> <s> i think it depends on how they are treated <e> <s> i am not quite sure what the record of the noble lord lord ross in this direction happens to be <e> <s> i rather detected the wish being the father of the thought in this connection but i hope that i was wrong about that <e>", "<cs> the noble lord founded his argument on two bases <e> <s> i think that he was longing to say that the sheriff was not an appropriate person to hear these appeals <e> <s> but not least because of the presence of his noble friend lord mishcon behind him and the presence of my noble and learned friend lord mackay of clashfern beside me on the front bench i do not think that he quite dared to <e> <s> but again if it is his unspoken wish in this connection i must say to him that my contention and that of the government in this particular instance and we are talking about a second stage of appeal where the parents have as it were been turned down by the education authority and by the appeal committee is that it is peculiarly proper that in fact a sheriff should entertain this form of appeal <e> <s> the parents will be frustrated and after the appeal committee they have no other recourse unless as they can at the moment they withhold their child from attending school until the authority serves an attendance order and then they can be summonsed before the sheriff anyway <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will agree that to that extent however we may disagree about the mechanics of the operation the present arrangements will be an improvement in that damage to a childs education may well be caused by sometimes prolonged absence from school while these things are worked out <e>", "<cs> the temptation is always there to say let us move on <e> <s> i will go away and think about it but this matter has been considered and thought about very extensively by the government <e> <s> it is the overriding policy of this government to relax the secretary of states control over local authority affairs and therefore even to consider the noble lords suggestion in this matter would be contrary to that policy <e> <s> beside which i think the sheriff is the better <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside for raising this point and indeed to the noble lord lord hughes and other noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> the noble and learned lord will know that under new section f an appeal will be dealt with as a summary application and that means in effect that the case will be dealt with under such procedure as the sheriff thinks fit <e> <s> nevertheless i feel that the noble and learned lord has here a real point which we need to consider <e> <s> everyone is agreed that the welfare of the children concerned is the primary indeed the only consideration and we shall have to have consultations not least with my noble and learned friend <e> <s> perhaps by one means or another we can return to this matter at the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> i can give the noble lord one or two examples which i think will show that in fact the subsection is perfectly logical and fair in its intention <e> <s> for instance if an appeal is lodged out of time because the parent is ill or because the childs parents are abroad during the period in question on holiday for instance or working abroad and whoever is looking after the child cannot get the necessary instructions from the parents in time to lodge the appeal within the prescribed time limit <e> <s> in my experience almost all appeals to legal authorities have an escape clause so that the appellant who may be appealing out of time but who may nevertheless not have been at fault or even negligent can obtain relief <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord for a constructive suggestion <e> <s> far from the heated exchanges of another place we scrutinise <e>", "<cs> i was interested to hear the reasons advanced by the noble lord lord ross as to why he seeks to transfer to the secretary of state a duty which is long established as he himself will know <e> <s> this clause in fact restates though with distinct differences section of the act <e> <s> in fact this is a duty which has rested with the education authorities since and it reflects the need and the opportunities which my noble friend lady elliot has emphasised for local communication <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to answer the noble lord because really it is a matter of literary taste <e> <s> i do now know whether he followed the proceedings in another place but they managed to occupy themselves on this subject for longer than one would have thought possible and even such words as log were suggested <e> <s> i do not know how seriously that was put forward but if one says to oneself a record of needs it seems to me to take away the unpleasant connotation if such exists of the single word record <e> <s> there is no point of principle about this still less of obstinacy <e>", "<cs> yes we thought the english got it wrong <e> <s> i think i can say without fear of contradiction that nobody liked the idea of the word statement <e> <s> it did not convey what is being done to try to help the child in these circumstances but i consider that record of needs is better than statement <e>", "<cs> the committee will understand this being a manuscript amendment that the department and certainly i have not had an opportunity to consider it as one would wish <e> <s> there is every difference of course between appealing out of time and responding to a notice but i am not going to weary the house with that sort of semantics <e> <s> i quite frankly do not know why the noble baroness chose days rather than it seems to me an extraordinarily clumsy period of time <e> <s> i am afraid that all i can do at this moment is respond by saying that if she will leave it with me i will take stock of the situation <e> <s> she might for the record perhaps just tell me why <e>", "<cs> the noble lord will know of course that this is a situation which has existed in special education since <e> <s> we did therefore look very seriously in considering our new approach to the handicapped and how it should be reflected in educational legislation <e> <s> i do recognise that the noble lords proposal in effect to delete this provision would on the face of it be entirely consistent with the idea that one tries to promote partnership between parent and education authority where children have special educational needs <e> <s> the education authorities that we consulted have stressed their belief that in fact the present informality of the relationship will continue and indeed no one can recall an instance in recent years of the use of this penalty clause <e> <s> but the point has been made that mention of its availability has on occasion been effectual in persuading a reluctant or a bad or neglectful parent to take action <e>", "<cs> this is a matter to which we have given attention already notwithstanding the noble baroness and her manuscript amendment <e> <s> as she has said this amendment would place on the education authority a duty to review a recording decision every six months instead of every months on parental request <e> <s> therefore it would mean that in order to carry out this duty they would have to reassess the child subjecting him as well as anything else to a renewed medical and psychological examination <e>", "<cs> first i should like to turn to the new section f which empowers the secretary of state to make regulations governing the standards and other requirements relating to the conduct of special schools and other schools making provision for recorded children or recorded young persons <e> <s> it is intended that regulations will be made under this power and they will extend not only to public schools but also to grant-aided schools and the independent sector <e> <s> obviously the regulations will have to take account of existing regulations in this field including the schools scotland code the schools general scotland regulations and the residential special schools and orphanages scotland grant regulations <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord parry for his welsh thrust <e> <s> my right honourable friends mind is by no means made up on this matter <e> <s> i do not know whether i misunderstood the noble lord opposite but i thought he was talking about the examination system when in fact what we are talking about is assessment <e>", "<cs> i appreciate what the noble lord lord parry has said but all these matters will be the subject of consultation <e> <s> the noble baroness lady david asked whether the parents in these instances will have access to professional reports <e> <s> i am informed that this is firmly opposed in england and i understand that it is not the intention at the moment at any rate that parents will have access to professional reports in scotland either <e>", "<cs> i cast no aspersions but if an amendment had been put down on this particular point then i would have had my tackle straight and i might have been a great deal less ignorant about these fine points <e> <s> of this amendment i can only say that i will repeat my offer to write to the noble baroness if it appears on reflection that i have not answered any point that she has raised <e> <s> if we have to come back to this at report stage then we shall do so <e>", "<cs> with respect that is quite un-true <e> <s> i have said that the regulations will be the subject of consultation not least with cosla and indeed with a number of other bodies such as those to which the noble baroness lady david referred when she was talking about professional reports <e> <s> as i understand it the whole point of a committee stage of a bill is that it allows noble lords to probe the government about their intentions in detail <e> <s> the power to make regulations is set out but what form the regulations will take will be the subject of consultation and agreement and that occurs frequently in all forms of legislation <e>", "<cs> i am always fascinated by lectures from the noble lord <e> <s> he finds it difficult to distinguish between primary legislation and regulations <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord ross for tabling the amendment <e> <s> it does not alter the substance of the scheme but it does help to clarify a point which opponents of the scheme seem to have found difficulty in appreciating and i welcome the noble lord as an ally in this because the schemes opponents both inside and outside parliament have <e>", "<cs> of course the noble lord lord ross of marnock answered his own debating point in almost the last sentence of his peroration when he said that even with the best will in the world the secretary of state for scotland cannot create schools which are not there <e> <s> that of course is the key to what lies behind this amendment <e> <s> even if there were a greater number of suitable independent schools spread evenly across the country this amendment would still be much too demanding <e>", "<cs> if i may just finish rannoch in perthshire where i spent a number of happy years during the war is certainly not lowland country <e> <s> nevertheless i must doubtless take the noble lords amendment as seriously as he means it to be taken and invite your lordships to reject it <e>", "<cs> i did not give way to the noble lord and there is no reason why he should give way to me but i forgot to point out one of the errors of his argument <e> <s> of course the fact that the scheme does not embrace boarding school fees does not mean that the children will not go to boarding school <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i could interrupt the noble lord again <e> <s> i am much obliged <e> <s> it is most important that we should not make a mistake on the record about this <e> <s> where boarding schools are offering places they the schools will find the boarding fees from their own resources <e> <s> those schools are gordonstoun rannoch fettes strathallan loretto merchiston fort augustus and glenalmond <e>", "<cs> i confirm at once that one of the objectives that we have kept in mind in designing the assisted places scheme is the desirability of providing places in schools of as many different kinds as possible so as to cater for the wishes of as many different kinds of parents as possible <e> <s> and this of course includes provision of places in denominational schools <e> <s> but it would not i suggest be appropriate to place the secretary of state under a statutory obligation to carry out that policy and it certainly would not be appropriate to give him a duty to achieve this policy to the extent of per cent <e>", "<cs> i recognise the desirability in theory of paying boarding fees so as to make assisted places available in residential schools <e> <s> the aim is to make the scheme available to as many scottish families as possible <e> <s> one must keep that in the forefront of ones mind <e> <s> given that travelling expenses can be paid for a distance of up to miles and we have heard a great deal from the noble lord lord ross about so to speak the geographical features it is perhaps fair to point out that there is a participating school within miles of the homes of per cent <e> <s> of scottish families <e>", "<cs> i can give the noble lord a list of all the participating schools if he really wants it <e>", "<cs> i have told the noble lord that nine of the schools are boarding schools and so the remaining schools are not <e>", "<cs> i think the answer is that if there are they are providing places on a day basis <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord follows me <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross of marnock asked how much money the boarding schools were getting in cash terms and how many boarding places there are <e> <s> in cash terms the boarding schools are receiving approximately <e> <s> i cannot answer how many places that represents because it will depend on the amount of money that is remitted by way of fees and that will depend on the amount of the remission to which the parents in any particular instance are entitled <e>", "<cs> i will deal with the amendment <e> <s> the fees to which the scheme applies are in subsection <e> <s> fees the payment of which is a condition of attendance <e> <s> one of the things which has become apparent while this scheme has been prepared and which has become apparent from our contacts with the participating schools is the wide variety of fees that could come under that description <e> <s> schools by their nature tend to be complex organisations and they impose charges on pupils for all manner of things <e>", "<cs> has the noble lord appreciated that this is not a free places scheme but an assisted places scheme <e> <s> does he also realise that there are <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to my noble friend for his support but i have to confess i suppose that in this instance at least the noble lord lord ross has a point and it was because of that in fact that we tabled amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i had hoped that the noble lord lord ross would have moved his amendment reasonably shortly and we could then have put mine into the bill without more ado <e>", "<cs> the difference is that in the public schools the parents are exercising a choice <e> <s> it is a choice which can be exercised and it can be changed after months <e> <s> it is rather a different matter when parents are considering whether they wish to enter their child if that is the correct phrase on an assisted places scheme <e> <s> the two schemes are entirely different and different considerations apply <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i can improve on the answer that i originally gave <e> <s> it is the distinction if you like between the public sector and individual applications for assisted places <e>", "<cs> the effect of the noble lords amendment would be to give any parent whose child had been refused admission to an assisted place a right of appeal against non-admission to the secretary of state <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned the sheriff but as drafted it would not be to the sheriff or anybody like that it would be to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> the debates on these amendments have certainly not been devoid of a certain amount of passion <e> <s> i have been very interested to try to read the mind of the noble lord lord ross and his reasons why he opposes the assisted places scheme <e> <s> of course the schism between the parties is complete <e> <s> of course noble lords opposite do not want whatever they may say the independent sector to flourish <e> <s> they do not like the idea that parents from lower income families can avail themselves of what generally is regarded as a high standard of education <e> <s> during the last matter over which i faced the noble lord lord ross across the dispatch box the noble lord accused the government of dragging the country down into the bargain basement <e> <s> of course the contrary is the truth <e> <s> what the government are trying to do is to provide a ladder so that people can climb up it <e>", "<cs> the intention of the government in adding representatives of the further education sector educational advisers and the independent and grant-aided sectors as was set out in this clause was to take into account all the interests of the sce examination board which has merged since the composition of the board was laid down by the education scotland act and consolidated in the act <e>", "<cs> no i do not <e> <s> these are employees of the education authority whose role is to examine the functioning of schools within their spheres of responsibility and to advise <e> <s> they have nothing to do with any outside body still less do they have special skills such as those of psychologists <e> <s> they do not examine the pupils they examine the working of the schools and make recommendations very often to headmasters <e>", "<cs> the effect of the noble lords amendment would be to introduce a provision into the act which expressly prevented education authorities from passing on to the parents of pupils in education authority schools the charges which the authorities pay to the board in respect of the examinations for which pupils are presented <e>", "<cs> there is nothing sinister about these two subsections of this particular clause as i hope to show the noble lord lord ross <e> <s> the purpose underlying subsection is first to remove any doubt about the power of the secretary of state under section of the act to attach conditions to grants given by him in the past to meet the obligation to the scottish certificate of education examination board secondly to enable him in the future with the boards consent to vary or revoke any such conditions <e> <s> so far as subsection is concerned the amendment would delete it from the bill <e>", "<cs> there is much in this bill which is precisely similar to the act <e> <s> we still keep the two committees one in respect of primary and secondary education and the other in respect of further education <e> <s> under the existing provisions which are basically section of the act there are four stages <e> <s> first the award is intimated to the secretary of state <e> <s> secondly the secretary of state must make an order which attracts no parliamentary procedure giving effect to the award so far as it recommends changes unless either house or an affirmative resolution resolves that effect should not be given to the award and the resolution of each house must be based on national economic circumstances <e> <s> thirdly if both houses pass the affirmative resolution the secretary of state then has to determine what changes should be made <e> <s> fourthly if both houses do not pass the affirmative resolution effect must be given to the award <e>", "<cs> it is difficult to see in what way any secretary of state could come to either house if this matter was raised by way of a prayer and justify the rejection of an arbiters award unless it was in the context of national economic circumstances <e> <s> he could not so far as i can conceive think of any other reason <e> <s> any discussion any debate which took place either in your lordships house or in another place against an order by a secretary of state would be bound to touch on the question of economic circumstances because as i have said the only reason which the secretary of state could give for refusing to accept the arbiters decision would be that the national economic circumstances do not justify an award of an increase of salary as recommended by the arbiter <e> <s> it really seems to me that what the noble lord is complaining about is that the previously affirmative resolution procedure which of course has its place but i do not think necessarily has its place in this type of situation should be preserved <e> <s> that is another matter <e> <s> however i see no reason why we should keep the words national economic circumstances in the bill when if one stops to think about it they are really i shall not say not justfied not necessary in these circumstances <e>", "<cs> may i deal first with the matter of the chairman and whether or not he is independent <e> <s> as i understand the position the existing negotiating bodies work quite effectively with chairmen who are chosen from among their own members <e> <s> for example the scottish teachers and the special service conditions committee <e> <s> therefore that seems to the government at any rate a matter which is working quite well and does not need to have any more elaborate statutory structure <e>", "<cs> i have related it and gave one example but i think that the principle is the same <e> <s> the view that we take is that there is no need to have a more rigid and less flexible machinery <e> <s> i think i can encapsulate the noble lords second question by saying that he questions the relationship of the committee with the local authority <e> <s> the secretary of state is as i understand it going to publish a memorandum or other piece of paper and this is going to be discussed with cosla if they wish it <e> <s> no doubt this will be one of the matters which they would wish to go over <e> <s> i do not think that i can help the noble lord any further than that <e> <s> so far as the procedures of the committee are concerned such matters as voting and so on will relate to their own standing orders and we think it is a matter for them to draw up their standing orders as they think fit <e>", "<cs> i tried to answer the noble lord <e> <s> he may not agree that the situation we shall set up is the best one in the circumstances and if he does not then it is his privilege to disagree and if he tables an amendment at the next stage or seeks to divide your lordships on whether this clause should be part of the bill then that too is his privilege <e> <s> but <e>", "<cs> i can answer the noble lord to this extent before we move on <e> <s> the previous administration of which the noble lord lord ross was a distinguished member consulted a number of bodies in and it was envisaged that the secretary of state would exercise statutory control over the amount of pay settlements <e> <s> my right honourable friend has decided not to include provision to that effect because it is considered that the local authorities and other employers concerned are capable of taking and indeed should take responsible decisions on what pay offers they can make within the resources available to them and we feel it should be left to them to make their own decisions <e> <s> as to whether the existing agreement will continue which is really what the noble lord is asking about these arrangements were negotiated outside the statutory framework and it will be a matter of negotiation as to whether they continue as i told the noble lord and i cannot at the moment anticipate the outcome of those negotiations <e>", "<cs> these two amendments in fact fall to be considered separately <e> <s> i appreciate that the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside has run his arguments in together no doubt with the perfectly laudible intention of saving time but i think i must address myself to each one separately <e> <s> if i may first deal with the point made by the noble lord lord mackie of benshie the noble lord lord hughes has of course shot my fox <e> <s> if the noble lord lord mackie had in fact read schedule he would have seen that an appeal committee can consist of no more than three persons from among those appointed by the authority under the schedule <e> <s> therefore as the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is adept at making thoroughly illogical leaps into the dark <e> <s> what i said was that in these matters where there could be significant public expenditure concerned there has to be full regard paid to public interest as well as the interests of parents and children <e> <s> i went on to say that in this particular instance the parents have a further right of appeal to the sheriff and that the local education authority who are after all the guardians of the public purse in this connection do not <e> <s> they have no further appeal <e> <s> we thought in those particular circumstances it was right that at the midway point that is to say the midway point between refusal of the education authority to give effect to the wishes of the parents and the other end of the spectrum when the sheriff finally decides the education authority should be in a majority of one so far as the appeal committee was concerned <e>", "<cs> for the second time in this debate the noble lord lord hughes has shot my fox <e> <s> of the three members on the opposition front bench who have sprung to the dispatch box two at least are now on my side <e> <s> i take comfort from this very welcome though possibly short-lived agreement with the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i can answer the noble lords three-sided question in this way but may i first say that i do not think that it is right to speak of delay <e> <s> it must be borne in mind that for instance the committees proposals were wide-ranging and some of them touched upon questions of organisation and responsibility <e> <s> the discussions which have been going on have involved no fewer than departments and agencies and i could regale the house with a list of them but i shall not <e> <s> however they have proceeded as quickly as practicable given the objective of finding a consensus <e> <s> the noble lord who headed this distinguished committee will also realise that there are a number of financial implications which the government have to consider <e> <s> so in the circumstances i hope that the house will not press me to predict at this time a firm date but i repeat that we are well seized of the importance of the report and its implications and we are equally seized of the need to announce our conclusion as soon as we can <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ross of marnock is of course right when he says that the substantive amendment is amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i know that the noble lord does not always appreciate the reasons why i criticise his amendment <e> <s> i am bound to say that i was not even going to mention that <e> <s> it was <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ross of marnock rather spoiled his argument with the last few sentences <e> <s> there is nothing between us on this <e> <s> it is not a question of cluttering up the bill or a clause of the bill <e> <s> as i said at the beginning the noble lord and i are as one <e> <s> we want to give every opportunity to society to help the parents of children who in many cases will need a great deal of help <e> <s> sometimes it is not easy to help the particular parents involved <e>", "<cs> my lords if my mind was not so addled these days i should reply to the noble lord in latin because it would be so much easier to explain than it is in english but as it is i cannot attempt it and i dare say that as a result i am being merciful to the shorthand writers <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that the purpose of this amendment is to distinguish between children who are physically in an area and children who belong to an area <e> <s> it may well be that at first blush this is a matter of semantics but when it comes to the question of who is to pay for education for children who are placed in this manner then it is far from being a semantic issue <e> <s> it becomes a very real issue and that is why in order to distinguish between the two types of children this amendment had to be made even though i appreciate that to the noble lord lord davies of leek it does not add to <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that we are talking about schooling rather than holidays <e>", "<cs> my lords the child belongs to the area where in the normal course of events it resides with its parents <e> <s> if for some reason either through ill health or because it is not getting on with its parents it goes to reside in another area for the school holidays i shall write to the noble baroness if i am wrong about this but i do not think i am it obviously does not disturb the legal position with regard to that childs education one little bit and therefore it makes no difference <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it comes about if one looks at section of the education scotland act <e> <s> that and regulations made under that section provide for the education of pupils who find themselves in one area that is to say in the area of one education authority although they belong to the area of another education authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely sympathise with the motivation behind the noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble lord would not want to mislead the house <e> <s> it is not a question of the appeal sitting in the secretary of states in-tray for three months <e> <s> there is reexamination by the appeal committee it has to go to this body first for a complete re-examination of all the issues before it goes to the secretary of state for final determination <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords

say that this is a report stage and i am going to confine myself to one speech per amendment <e> <s> we discussed an identical amendment in committee where of course the noble lord was perfectly free to intervene as often as he liked and did so <e> <s> i was waiting to see whether he would adduce any new arguments on this occasion but i am afraid my wait was in vain <e>", "<cs> i do not have that information my lords <e> <s> the noble lord said there were no schools in the scheme in the highlands not merely boarding schools and i am saying that gordonstoun is knocking on the gateway fort augustus is actually in it and if rannoch is not in the highland board area it certainly does not lie as i know to my cost on a piece of flat ground <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that the noble lord lord ross wishes to add clarification <e>", "<cs> my lords by this amendment the noble lord lord ross of marnock would seek to place on the secretary of state for scotland the duty and indeed the obligation to prescribe a method <e>", "<cs> most pupils do not have any means at all <e> <s> but be that as it may as i understand it the means test is not to be on the pupil so much as on the parent <e> <s> the family income must be or less and as i said when speaking on a previous amendment the results are not by any manner or means all in <e> <s> but i can tell the house today that of the third or so of the results that we have received up until now about per cent <e> <s> of the children will be admitted to school on what i might call a full remission basis <e> <s> so as of today and on the basis of the results in so far that proportion are from families whose incomes are of the order that i have described <e> <s> so if there is any allegation which i rather thought the noble lord lord ross might make that the scheme would be used to advantage better off families and that schools would operate their admission schemes so as to favour such families i would say that it does not seem as if the situation is going to be like that <e> <s> in fact one can say that so far there does not seem to be any economic bias at all and that of course is as it should be <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house and i am not speaking from an intense knowledge of this these things are usually decided neither on gross nor on take-home pay <e> <s> they are determined on gross pay with a number of deductions which may be made for certain purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully accept that anything that the noble lord proposes if it is not beneficial will be harmless <e> <s> the trouble with this amendment is that it is defective <e> <s> it seeks to allow the schools incompletely at that to require the provision of certain things instead of making such provision themselves but new section b empowers the secretary of state to require schools to provide certain things and does not carry with it a related power to the schools themselves to require the provision of those things by another party <e> <s> in the absence of such power the proposed amendment has no foundation and would not be sufficient in itself to confer such a power on schools <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will appreciate that his laudable ambition to improve the bill would do no such thing <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the house and the noble lord lord ross that the question of the relaxation of the secretary of states present control over proposed changes and such matters as school closures is one to which the government have given very close attention over a considerable period of time <e> <s> i have to tell the noble lord that we remain firmly of the opinion that the education authorities should be given discretion since they are best able to judge what is appropriate for their area <e> <s> in bill after bill where the government have taken powers to regulate the activities of local authorities where such activities are not in the public interest the noble lord has inveighed against the government and spoken about a negation of local democracy that local government is in effect dead and is ruled by diktat by my right honourable friend the secretary of state sitting in his desk at st andrews house <e>", "<cs> in accordance with our general policy we are now relaxing controls which are no longer required and are putting decision-making into the hands of the representatives of

has not argued against the principle and no other voice has been raised so i shall confine myself to answering some of his points some of which go to detail <e>", "<cs> my lords the short answer to the noble lords question is that the government are acting at the request of the three universities involved to remove an ancient anomaly <e> <s> the clause allows each of the universities concerned to appoint their own principal <e> <s> this will bring them into line with the great majority of united kingdom universities including the four newer scottish ones and the vast majority have always appointed their own executive heads <e> <s> the universities asked for this change and would welcome it <e> <s> her majesty has consented to the proposal <e> <s> edinburgh university which was consulted to see whether it wanted to go along with the other three said no thank you <e> <s> it wanted to keep its arrangements as they were and that it is being permitted to do <e> <s> the reason

amendments nos <e> <s> to <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> this amendment was in fact proposed by the opposition in another

ourselves as also did the other place <e> <s> the conclusion was reached that for the reason i have stated namely that qualified legal advice should be available it was thought that a renunciation ought only to be sworn before a notary public <e> <s> a justice of the peace might be unlikely to have the necessary grasp of the law to offer competent advice on this important step and that is because justices of the peace in scotland as in england can be lay persons <e> <s> the amendment accordingly removes the possibility of a renunciation being sworn before a justice of the peace thus requiring that a renunciation must be sworn before a notary public and in scotland a notary public must be a solicitor <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in

occupancy of what had been the matrimonial home without paying for it <e> <s> this possibility was very much in the minds of everyone when this amendment came to be drafted <e> <s> the whole thrust of house ownership at the moment is towards joint ownership <e> <s> i suspect that the number of houses which are in fact now bought on mortgage in the name of only one spouse is comparatively small as compared with the whole <e> <s> so it is believed that this is the solution which the building societies would prefer and this is the case with mortgages as they are now and and will be in the future

noble friend lord stodart said these are not easy matters and there are protagonists who are passionately disposed to their particular point of view <e> <s> there are really two matters here first the actual licensing and secondly the question of fares <e> <s> the amendment as lord ross said would have the effect of transferring responsibility for licensing control of taxis and hire cars from

touchpaper but nothing has happened <e> <s> subsection of clause is in no way meant to express or imply even that there is a need to control local authority activities and there is a well-established convention that local authorities have to meet the same statutory obligations as the private sector does in some other licensing activities <e> <s> i can illustrate that by adducing the examples of liquor licensing and in relation to planning <e> <s> in other words a local authority has to give itself planning permission in the right instance <e>", "<cs> far be it from me to tread on the other side of the chamber <e> <s> where i think the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside might have come to my aid as a fellow lawyer even if in a different jurisdiction is when the noble lord

already mentioned the kind of cycle of local authority committee meetings which are likely to occur in order to hear licensing applications <e> <s> so in effect i agree with the noble lord when he says that in the great majority of cases a licensing authority should be able to consider and dispose of an application within three months <e> <s> one has to bear in mind that what clause lays down

noble friend <e> <s> that is perfectly true <e> <s> regarding the licensing authority although it will be a matter for the district council or islands council to decide in all likelihood it will be a committee of the council <e> <s> therefore it will be able to adopt flexible methods of working as its own particular local circumstances dictate <e>", "<cs> yes my noble friend is perfectly right <e> <s> what subsection of clause allows a council to do as a licensing authority is to delegate the decision-taking in a way which commends itself to the council <e> <s> in other words they can either sit as a council or they can set up a committee or subcommittees or they can even delegate the authority to <e>", "<cs> there has been an instruction to the committee and under that instruction we are to examine the first schedule after clause so suggest that we go on now to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord this is entirely through my forgetfulness <e> <s> the

may say so this is really the normal way of doing things to consider what i may call the enabling clause and then to consider the schedule which it sets up <e>", "<cs> we had our debate on the flexibility or otherwise of the licensing authority and i explained that following the publication of the white paper it was the governments wish to have a more flexible and indeed a simpler procedure <e> <s> we decided there was no reason why the functions of the authority under this bill should be any different from the normal committee meetings arranged as and when business requires them <e>", "<cs> this is a titillating phrase and i want to emphasise that i am speaking in legal or drafting terms <e> <s> by definition a natural person is an individual human being <e> <s> there are no other kinds of natural persons <e> <s> all other persons are of a non-natural kind for example companies local authorities and to some extent partnerships <e> <s> since there are no kinds of natural persons apart from individual human beings it is unnecessary to specify that a natural person is also an individual <e> <s> to do so indeed might suggest that there are kinds of natural persons other than individuals <e> <s> the licensing scotland act speaks of an individual natural person but although the licensing system in this bill is based on the scheme of the act it does not follow it slavishly

keep the noble lord in suspense <e> <s> it is my intention to amend that subsection when we come to it <e>", "<cs> i am by no means hard and fixed in my approach to this amendment <e> <s> may i just explain to the committee that the words which the noble lord seeks to delete were included for illustrative purposes and to make it clear that information could be required in a form other than a bald statement of facts or figures <e> <s> an illustration which comes to mind is the case of a boat hirer <e> <s> plans of his boats could be required so that the fire authorities could make up their minds as to the necessary precautions to be taken <e> <s> having said that i confess that not very much would be lost by removing the words they did not appear in the consultation document <e> <s> if on reflection the noble lord wished to press his amendments i would not seek to stop him <e>", "<cs> to a very large extent we considered the principle of this amendment when we discussed amendment no <e> <s> and more especially when we discussed the suggestion made by the noble lord lord ross of marnock that there should be fixed quarterly meetings of the licensing authority <e> <s> outside that sort of framework that is fixed quarterly meetings or whatever the fixed period might be it seems to me that this amendment makes relatively little sense <e>", "<cs> i have considerable sympathy with the noble lords perfectly laudable desire to reduce paper work and work of any kind where it is not necessary <e> <s> the noble lord has no doubt observed that in the draft of the bill the only applications automatically forwarded to the fire authority are those in respect of an activity involving premises <e> <s> i have no doubt that the noble lord wanted to introduce a somewhat similar limitation on the duty of the licensing authority providing that they are required to forward licence applications to the fire authority only where they consider it to be appropriate <e>", "<cs> i may be out of order but i must tell the noble lord that after our brush over this word in the last bill i went straight to the oxford english dictionary and rejoiced in the fact that we were both right and i have no doubt that he did too <e> <s> nevertheless attractive as we all find the word to be i do not think that it would add anything significant in practice <e> <s> under clause of the bill as we have already discussed it in committee the local authority is under a duty to consider applications within a maximum time which is specified and laid down <e> <s> the period of objections or representations provided for later in the schedule is determined ultimately by the date of publication of the advertisement rather than the receipt of the application <e> <s> so i may perhaps <e>", "<cs> this provision was part of the consultation document and it was not objected to and that is the reason why it finds itself in the bill <e> <s> it is different of course as the noble lord has inferred from the liquor licensing provisions <e> <s> i think i am prepared to accept the amendment if the noble lord wishes to press it <e> <s> i should say because i do not want to deceive the noble lord that if one looks at paragraph of the schedule which relates to fees the costs of advertising as a whole could be reflected in the fees charged under that paragraph of the schedule <e> <s> so it would be a matter <e>", "<cs> i wondered when the noble lord lord underhill was going to rise to his feet <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross did not move amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am not blaming him for that but it would have led us gradually into this part of the schedule <e> <s> what sub-paragraph says in effect is that where you have a prescribed class of applicant the licensing authority shall cause public notice to be given of every application where you have an application which does not fall within a prescribed class then the licensing authority may if they think fit cause public notice to be given <e> <s> then we go on to sub-paragraph where it says in effect that the secretary of state in his discretion is the authority who prescribes a class or classes of licences for the purposes of sub-paragraph which i have just gone through <e>", "<cs> i have not said that <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can interrupt <e> <s> i said that we would want to consult the convention and that is absolutely right and they may very well have ideas of their own <e> <s> but i did give examples of the sort of activities which the government feel as of this moment are right for advertisement because it could have certain undesirable consequences upon people occupying premises near or adjacent to where the activity which is to be the subject of the licence is taking place <e> <s> that is not to say that the convention for all i know may come down one way or another so far as taxi-drivers are concerned <e> <s> but speaking for myself i should have thought that they would not fall into that class <e>", "<cs> it is paragraph <e>", "<cs> this is a rather different matter from the previous occasion when i said that i would take it back and look at the drafting <e> <s> whether the noble lord wants it or not the effect of his amendment would be to return to the position in this clause as drafted in the consultative white paper <e> <s> as i said before of course i am sympathetic to the desire to reduce paperwork and as i said i am prepared to consider the possibility of limiting the duty of licensing authorities as regards notification about licence applications <e>", "<cs> the suburbs where i live are perhaps not so desirable as the noble lords area <e>", "<cs> we have mobile fish-and chippers and a horrible noise they make with their chimes <e> <s> but i am concerned about the highly combustible equipment that they use in order to prepare the fish and chips <e> <s> if this was not written into the schedule the fire authority might not be in the position to give the advice which it should when the mobile traders licence is being applied for <e> <s> that is my point <e> <s> therefore i maintain that it is desirable for the fire authority to be empowered to object and to be publicly heard in a case which might involve risk to the public as well as to the operator of the mobile fish-and-chipper <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is perfectly right to try to achieve what he seeks to achieve <e> <s> the trouble is that he is not going about it in a manner which harmonises with the drafting convention which avoids the use of lower case letters followed by small <e>", "<cs> again i sympathise with the noble lord in what he is trying to achieve and again i shall undertake to take this away <e> <s> i say that immediately <e> <s> it is only right that the explanation which the draftsman has given to me should at least be put before the committee <e> <s> it was thought that the expression proper address which the noble lord seeks to omit is a convenient label although it does not have any other legal significance <e> <s> when used both in line of sub-paragraph <e>", "<cs> this sub-paragraph has an eminently respectable provenance because it follows the line of the provisions in the licensing scotland act and more especially section <e> <s> it is in no sense a power of administering a fine to be exercised by the licensing authority <e> <s> what it does is to enable the licensing authority to charge frivolous vexatious or unauthorised objections for the time and expenses incurred by the authority in disposing of the objections <e> <s> it enables the authority to recover the cost by bringing a civil action in the sheriff court <e>", "<cs> i am not by any means sure that the addition of the word reasonably is going to he very helpful to the local authority as there can clearly be argument as to what is or is not reasonable in any particular set of circumstances <e> <s> but i have sympathy with the noble lords intention which is to restrict the obligation of the licensing authority so that they do not of necessity have to provide a duplicate licence to anyone who asks for it <e> <s> i think it is arguable that only the licence holder himself or his authorised agent should have any need for a duplicate <e> <s> anybody else who has an interest should be satisfied with a certified copy of the register of applications provided for in paragraph of this schedule <e> <s> so i am inclined to accept the spirit of the amendment by considering an amendment to qualify the duty of the licensing authority to provide a duplicate licence to any person to make it clear that such a duty applies to the provision of a duplicate only to the licence holder or his representative <e> <s> so if the noble lord lord ross would be good enough to withdraw his amendment for now i will take stock of the matter <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord knows licences will be in force for three years <e> <s> i accept the noble lords contention that it will be of benefit if the terminal date of the licence is shown upon it <e> <s> i am happy to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> the committee will have observed that the noble lord did not move his paving amendment to this particular amendment which would have been amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i say that because one without the other scarcely makes sense <e> <s> in fact this provision was introduced partly as a result of the working party and also as a result of comments received following the publication of the consultation <e>", "<cs> except for the last few sentences of his remarks i agree with the noble lord lord ross and i am happy to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> this amendment would create a great deal of extra and i consider unnecessary additional work for the licensing authority <e> <s> the paragraph requires the authority when requested within hours of their decision by any competent party to the licence application either as applicant or objector to provide written reasons for their decision to the party so requesting it <e> <s> i regard it as being unreasonable to require the authority to copy their written reasons to all other parties even if they have not asked for them <e>", "<cs> i am not sure why the noble lord thinks that six weeks is far far too short <e> <s> he <e>", "<cs> the noble lord will recollect that when we discussed amendment no <e> <s> last week i undertook to look at all these clauses and paragraphs where the fire authority is mentioned <e> <s> what i undertook to do was to re-examine the possibility of limiting the duties of the licensing authority to circumstances which might in fact be more appropriate than in all circumstances <e> <s> since the noble lord was kind enough to refer to my family home i can think of an example where perhaps it would not be appropriate to refer to the fire authority because we are to have a bible-reading convention for a week <e>", "<cs> i am not sure whether the noble lord has been asked to open it but i wait with interest <e> <s> in the circumstances that would surely be inappropriate for the fire authority <e> <s> having regard to the terms of my undertaking perhaps the noble lord would withdraw his amendment for now <e>", "<cs> this as the noble lord said is a drafting amendment <e> <s> as the noble lord equally well knows draftsmen go about their strange and esoteric task in a way which i think only they understand <e> <s> when i first saw this which was before the weekend i thought that the noble lords amendment probably would do no harm and it might make the schedule easier for laymen and newcomers to read <e> <s> however i believe that the draftsmen think differently <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the noble lord is being so helpful in this particular amendment as he would have the committee believe <e> <s> sub-paragraph <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to interrupt the noble lord and i do so simply to mention that there <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ross was of course right to say that these provisions relating to the transfer of licences were included in the consultation document and were based on similar arrangements in the licensing scotland act <e> <s> the reason why the clauses were dropped and do not appear in the bill was because of the views of the local authorities <e> <s> those were that the transfer system as proposed was unnecessarily complex and they the local authorities doubted the need for such arrangements if the licensing system as a whole was made more flexible so that it could be possible under the general system to apply speedily for a new licence without having to wait for the fixed statutory meetings <e> <s> that is one of the reasons why i resisted the amendments of the noble lord lord ross which tried to make the machinery of application for licences cumbersome and attached to quarterly meetings <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord answer a question <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether the noble lord is going to withdraw his amendment but i assume he has read it through <e> <s> where is the automatic transfer <e> <s> what the noble lord accuses the government of doing is of replacing something easy with a cumbersome framework <e> <s> what i am trying to say to the noble lord is that it is the noble lords cumbersome framework which he provides in his amendment which the local authorities did not want put into the bill <e> <s> at the very start of his amend <e>", "<cs> i think we had the argument on the transfer of licences in general on amendment no <e> <s> and i do not think that i can say very much more except to repeat that there is nothing in the noble lords amendments that is to say amendment no <e> <s> and this one which follows it which is in any way speedier or cheaper than what is proposed in the bill <e> <s> i have in fact undertaken in the case of death in office or death in harness so to speak to see whether in fact what we have proposed fully meets all contingencies <e> <s> but apart from that i do not think i can help the committee any further on this amendment <e>", "<cs> this was a recommendation or at any rate a provision which was in the consultative white paper draft of the bill <e> <s> we considered the point carefully and concluded that since licence applica <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble lord and invite the committee to do likewise <e>", "<cs> this amendment seeks to delete a clarifying reference to clause and as such i suggest it would do no more than to remove a helpful cross-reference guide which makes it clear that although clause does not apply to window cleaners this is not an absolute exemption and the reader is referred to clause <e> <s> as such the reference is helpful and that is what it is intended to be <e> <s> if we look at clause we see it provides that <e>", "<cs> i respectfully agree with the <e>", "<cs> may i say that unless there is some sort of qualification at the end of the sub-section it then becomes meaningless <e>", "<cs> i see the force of what the noble lord lord ross has said regarding the penalty for this offence and i am content to accept his amendment <e>", "<cs> there are difficult questions here as between equity and the protection of the public <e> <s> the present sub-paragraph followed the model of section of the licensing scotland act <e> <s> so far as i am aware the section has not given rise to any difficulty either for licenceholders or licensing authorities <e> <s> although the clerk sends an extract of the conviction to the licensing authority the licence-holders right of appeal against conviction is of course unaffected and if an appeal is lodged under section of the criminal procedures scotland act the clerk automatically arranges to notify the licensing authority of the outcome of the appeal <e> <s> this is done administratively <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord may be slightly confused over his period of nine months <e> <s> the nine months runs from the day upon which the resolution is passed and not from the day upon which the licensing authority sets about its task <e> <s> there is no question of sub-committees or anything else <e> <s> what one has to do is to strike a fair balance between the rights of the local authority to exercise effective control and the rights of those engaged in a trade to be given every opportunity to safeguard their legitimate livelihood <e> <s> therefore we feel that where an activity is to be licensed which has not previously been subject to that form of control the trade in question should have very full warning of the fact so that people have ample opportunity to make any alterations to their vehicles premises or equipment which may be necessary to meet the new requirements <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws the amendment i wonder whether i may put him right again <e> <s> it might be helpful and not only to the noble lord if i explain as briefly as i can just how we envisage these licensing authorities affecting the transition between the existing licensing system under the burgh police acts or local acts in respect of a given activity and the new system in respect of the same activity provided for under the optional provisions in the bill which licensing authorities can adopt by resolution under clause <e> <s> after the bill receives royal assent it will be necessary first to complete consultation with interested parties on a number of points particularly on the conditions in respect of hire car and taxi licences which under clause the secretary of state has power to prescribe and proscribe by regulation <e>", "<cs> this is part of a safeguard which we have built into the bill to keep those involved in the trades concerned in touch with the thinking of the licensing authority at each stage <e> <s> one of the safeguards is this one <e> <s> it is a provision that licensing authorities may not make a resolution which goes wider than the scope of the proposed resolution previously advertised in draft <e> <s> we felt that the trades to be licensed should without exception have an opportunity to make representations to the local authority about the terms of the draft resolution covering them and the right to have their representations considered <e> <s> if licensing authorities could widen the scope of a draft <e>", "<cs> the delay has been put into the clause with two main considerations in mind <e> <s> first it was our intention to give local authorities time to make administrative preparations for the new scheme for instance to get forms and instructions printed <e> <s> perhaps more importantly it was intended also to give those involved in the trades concerned time to consider their premises vehicles and equipment and to obtain any legal advice required to draft their applications so that when the licensing authorities first came to consider the applications they would have some idea of how many applications there were likely to be in total and how the provision of licensed activities might be distributed across the area <e> <s> therefore what this one months delay is designed to achieve is what i might call orderly application on the part of those who will want licences <e> <s> i would stress that it is really the licensing authority which will not consider an application before one month as opposed to a ban on the submission and it was as much from a desire to be fair to all would-be licence-holders as to its own procedures that this provision was drafted in this way <e>", "<cs> in fact the noble lord is wrong <e> <s> there is nothing to stop someone from submitting an application but it will not be considered for a month <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord underhill has said this new clause would allow the licensing authority to refuse applications for taxi operators licences if in their opinion there are already sufficient licences to provide a satisfactory service to the public consistent with providing a reasonable livelihood to taxi operators <e> <s> it would also require the licensing authority to send a copy of all taxi licence applications to representatives of the existing licensing trade who would have a right to object to any new applications <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord underhill decides what he is going to do and in view of my undertaking i assume that he will withdraw his amendment at least at this stage i wonder whether i can put to him just what it is he has to do to convince the government that his case is just <e> <s> the government have consulted the federation on a great number of occasions at official level <e> <s> but the drawback to their arguments has been as in fact my noble friend lord selkirk hinted that they have produced a number of assertions of what they want to see and not arguments based on fact <e> <s> for instance no hard evidence has been produced based on facts and figures that in areas for instance where the number of taxis is limited there has in any way been a more satisfactory scheme of things than in other areas where the number is not limited <e> <s> conversely there have been no facts or figures produced that the kind of undesirable consequences which the noble lord said would happen for instance part-timers and cowboys have arisen at any rate in an unsatisfactory manner <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord underhill has spoken to both his new clauses and i shall do the same <e> <s> as he said the specific arrangements which were contained in the white paper for the transferability of any licence under the bill not just for taxis were dropped as a result of views expressed by the local authorities that they were unnecessary and unduly complex <e> <s> i must possibly correct what the noble lord said in respect of the working party on civic government <e> <s> the noble lord was right to say that they said on page of their report that the national federation of taxicab associations was strongly of the view that a taxi licence should be regarded as property which could be sold or transferred with the vehicle <e> <s> while there were arguments in principle against a licence granted by a local authority being sold for private gain it is true that decisions by a local authority can have a significant capital value and i quoted as did the noble lord the example of planning permission <e>", "<cs> nothing in front of me would suggest other than that hire car means what it says and it means any vehicle other than a taxi or public service vehicle which is quite differently provided for under the act <e> <s> if i am wrong about this i will let the noble lord know directly but my instinct is that a minibus is merely a car with rather more seats in it <e>", "<cs> the answer is yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank both noble lords for their reaction to this statement <e> <s> so far as suddenness is concerned i understand that british aluminium losses were by september running at half a million pounds a week and it was in those circumstances when the company apparently decided that its whole viability as a group was coming under threat that matters started to move

different departments in the scottish office started the process off particularly in the scottish economic planning department but as things developed my honourable friend mr fletcher and subsequently my right honourable friend the secretary of state were both consistently and to a large extent of their time involved in these negotiations <e> <s> the negotiations took place with representatives of british aluminium among others <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not possible at the moment to predict future electrical demand <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords in so far as these matters which the noble lord raised are quantifiable and some which the noble lord illustrated are not and others which he did not mention are the government took all these into account in so far as they could <e>", "<cs> my

measure of agreement between the two major parties on this matter <e> <s> the attitude of the government is this <e> <s> we want and think it is sensible to develop the option of an economic safe alternative to our existing gas cooled reactors <e> <s> the world has more experience of operating the pwr than of operating any other reactor type <e> <s> it makes sense to ascertain whether we can harness this technology to meet our own requirements <e> <s> of course i am very conscious of the noble lords point that that must include safety standards <e> <s> however the governments case is perfectly clear <e> <s> each application to build a nuclear power station wherever it may be will be treated strictly on its merits <e> <s> that goes for all these applications <e> <s> i think the answer to the noble lords question is yes <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble lords questions basically speaking is yes <e> <s> the arrangements for the inquiry are primarily for the inspector <e> <s> i am not in a position to announce any names this afternoon but those kinds of details will <e>", "<cs> my lords the government entirely agree with the noble lord that safety and everything that goes with it is a matter which commands and deserves the greatest attention and i have no doubt that when my right honourable friend is guided by the report of the inspector before he makes any final determinations upon this matter he will pay such regard <e> <s> i think i must remind the noble lord that whatever our fears and i think they are as persons justifiable fears may be so far as the nuclear industry is concerned at any rate in this country the industry has a safety record second to none <e>", "<cs> my lords the rather long answer to which my noble friend referred was in answer to a tripartite question <e> <s> other countries in the european community do indeed give national aid to their fleets <e> <s> we do not claim to have comprehensive information on such aid and it is particularly difficult to make meaningful comparisons between different countries <e> <s> that is because the fleets are differently constituted differently sized and governments have different policies on aid to fishing which can be paid as my noble friend illustrated in different ways such as regional grants free harbour facilities and even sometimes aid towards fuel costs <e> <s> her majestys government have set their face against making an artificial price for fuel which is not confined to the fishing industry but applies to many other industries as well <e> <s> the reply to the last part of my noble friends supplementary questions is no the aid which we made available to help keep our fishing fleet stable was for the most part paid out to the skippers of the various boats involved <e>", "<cs> my lords the confidence of the fishing industry is not all one might hope for in the circumstances because so much depends on the successful negotiation of a fair common fisheries policy which will provide an equitable means for the fishing industry of this country to fish as i say in <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will be well aware one of the countries of the nine with some particular interest in fishing has had a somewhat inconclusive general election and there is no doubt that that has as it were brought the negotiations to a halt <e> <s> her majestys government are working extremely hard at the moment both by bilateral negotiations with some of our other community partners and by making representations both to the commission and to the belgians who now hold the chair and it is to be hoped that further negotiations at council of ministers level will recommence before very long <e>", "<cs> my lords continuous experimentation is going on in relation to these previously less than popular varieties of fish <e> <s> in fairness to my noble friend i should tell him that at present the research is slanted more to what to do with the fish once one has got it rather than to the catching of it <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the minister of agriculture set up a committee of his wise people as they have been called who produced a challenging and entertaining report on the marketing of fish in this country <e> <s> their recommendations have been considered both by the various <e>", "<cs> my lords i regard that view as unduly gloomy and unjustified <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord reinforces the points about the conservation of fish stocks and the limitation of fishing opportunity which is accorded great priority by her majestys government <e> <s> one of the few areas where there has been general agreement as between our partners in the european community is that without a sensible and enforceable conservation rgime there will be no fish left to catch <e>", "<cs> in a philosophical manner of speaking my lords i think the noble lord is right the modern fishing boat with all the electronic methods and aids available to the skipper is a totally different craft from those of only or years ago <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord to that extent but it comes back to the point that we must have a sensible conservation rgime that it must be properly enforced and that we must have an allocation of quotas and access which will prevent these over-efficient boats from taking more than their share <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord selkirk and the noble lord lord ross of marnock who have expressed their anxieties if that is the correct word in respect of this clause <e> <s> may i begin by saying why it was felt not least by the working party that there should be a form of control over the second-hand trade and its activities <e> <s> the reason is that the second-hand trade is an obvious convenient and regrettably all too common outlet for stolen goods <e> <s> not least the police consider it essential that there should be some means of scrutiny and control over trade in those areas or in those types of merchandise where crime prevention is a desirable and a significant feature <e> <s> equally we recognise that there are areas and types of trade in which licensing may serve no useful purpose and it is for this reason that the provision is included so far as this clause is concerned on an optional basis to be used if and to the extent that local circumstances may so warrant <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to question the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside when he starts to construe a clause <e> <s> however <e>", "<cs> i will consider this one if i may <e> <s> it is indeed simple as the noble lord has said <e> <s> i think we just do have to bear in mind that in the burgh police scotland act the keeping of records was and is seen as a desirable feature as part of crime prevention and there is an argument which has been put forward and it is the only one really which prevents my accepting the noble lords contention here and now that if it were left to the local authority to decide whether or not books should be kept this would negate the purpose of controlling second-hand dealers by licensing <e>", "<cs> i am assured that powers already exist for the recovery of records at the order of the court where these are required as evidence in criminal proceedings <e> <s> i am sorry that i am not able to quote chapter and verse in other words the legal authority for what i am saying to my noble friend at the moment but perhaps he would be content to rest on my assurance for now <e> <s> i promise him that i shall have the legal authority for what i am saying before the night is out <e> <s> if he is so content perhaps he will see fit to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am perfectly happy to consider that <e> <s> i think the noble lord has to bear in mind now the five-day week bank holidays and particularly such times as christmas and new year when the period of festivities goes into hundreds of hours <e> <s> but i will certainly look at it again <e>", "<cs> the noble lord who used to brief me in my early days has really given me a very googly ball if i may say so <e> <s> the answer is that i do not know but i will find out <e>", "<cs> the working party recommended that second-hand dealers should have the right to detain anyone offering articles thought to have been stolen or unlawfully obtained <e> <s> the government accepted this recommendation but we thought it prudent to protect the second-hand dealer who had acted in good faith against the possibility of civil action arising from the detention of a suspect <e> <s> we thought and in fact still feel that without this provision in the bill the dealer would feel unable to act even when he had good reason because he would not be protected against a civil action for what may have been a perfectly genuine mistake <e> <s> clearly this provision in clause will greatly assist the police in certain instances when they are trying to find stolen property <e> <s> we were fortified in this because as i have said the provision was included in the consultation paper and no adverse criticism was attracted <e>", "<cs> i wish that the noble lord would move it <e>", "<cs> i wanted the noble lord lord ross at least to move his amendment because such is the speed with which the scottish office works which was not wholly to be welcomed may i say by the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside on a previous occasion when the bill was debated that we have already considered the noble lords earlier amendment to clause of the bill though of course i have to confess that there has been an unusually long period between the different days in committee on this bill <e> <s> what we have done is to consult the scottish courts administration and i am now of the opinion that the bill as drafted is indeed adequate <e> <s> if the amendment were accepted it would introduce an inconsistency of approach in the area of conviction and <e>", "<cs> the noble lord seeks in effect to apply the mandatory licensing requirements i agree with him that in the area of metal dealers they are mandatory to itinerant metal dealers in a way which would mean as he has said that they would have to apply for a separate licence every time they went into a separate licensing authority area <e> <s> i correct myself to this extent that they would have to apply for a separate licence for every district or licensing area in which they wanted to ply their trade <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether the noble lord lord ross of marnock really wishes me to respond again <e> <s> he cannot have it both ways <e>", "<cs> he says that the tinkers cannot keep records but undoubtedly they will want to do so because they will want to pay their income tax <e> <s> if the noble lord says they cannot keep records then they certainly cannot apply in every single licensing district for a licence to ply their trade particularly when as i am trying to illustrate it is not necessary for them to do so <e>", "<cs> if by a slip of the tongue i said united kingdom when i meant to say scotland i apologise <e> <s> this bill is of course one which applies only to scotland <e>", "<cs> if i point the finger at my noble friend it is because he is having not only a clause stand part debate but also a nine-clause stand part debate when we have not yet considered most of the clauses <e> <s> if i may say so the time to have this debate is when we finish with clause which is the definitions clause on which a lot of the misunderstandings if i may so call them and uncertainties are in fact put right <e> <s> nevertheless i accept my noble friends castigation although it will mean that we shall have to go backwards and forwards through the pages of these clauses and consider them as we go through as well as now <e>", "<cs> the licence will be the same but of course the duties consequential upon it will be entirely different because the man in business in a big way will have premises and he will therefore have to observe the conditions of the licence and indeed the law in relation to his business premises <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly have a look at it <e> <s> i would just remind the noble lord lord ross that the consultation document in relation to metal dealings suggested a -day retention period <e> <s> but we considered that that was really far too long <e> <s> however i shall certainly consider whether hours is the right period <e>", "<cs> there are a number of fundamental mistakes which are being made by noble lords in relation to these clauses <e> <s> i shall deal first with the noble lord lord ross <e> <s> clauses to cover metal dealers <e> <s> metal dealers are defined in clause <e> <s> therefore those five clauses deal with both static and itinerant metal dealers <e> <s> clause applies to itinerant metal dealers as defined in clause and in effect relaxes some of the rules or some of the book-keeping requirements which are applied to what i might call static metal dealers <e> <s> that i hope disposes of that problem <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> under the burgh police scotland act itinerant metal dealers are treated as brokers and are therefore subject to the legislation applying to brokers <e> <s> i do not wish to mislead the committee in any way and the committee would not expect me to i do not know that the receipts presently have to be kept by itinerant metal dealers for any particular time <e> <s> i must say that <e>", "<cs> clause applies only to itinerant metal dealers <e> <s> therefore there is no question of any farmer committing any offence under that clause <e> <s> in effect the itinerant metal dealer has to give a receipt or an invoice call it what you will it depends who is giving it and who is taking it in respect of a sale of scrap metal <e> <s> at the moment he has to keep that for two years <e>", "<cs> yes it does <e>", "<cs> i think that the word he is perfectly plain <e> <s> there may be parts of this sub-section which are not but i think that the word he is <e> <s> if my noble friends amendment were accepted we would have the word dealer appearing twice and indeed side by side in the same line <e>", "<cs> of course the definition of metal applies to metal dealers and it does not matter a hoot whether they are static metal dealers or itinerant metal dealers although it is probable that so far as precious metal is concerned it is more likely that that will be dealt with or dealt in is a better phrase by static metal dealers <e> <s> the words of the definition are in fact meant to be all-embracing <e> <s> in other words metal includes one could have said in a sloppy way all metal but what the draftsman has chosen to do is to define metal as <e>", "<cs> i think we have discussed this definition of an itinerant dealer fairly extensively <e>", "<cs> if the purpose of obtaining the old gold was to sell it eventually for scrap then he would be an itinerant metal dealer because he would come under the definition of clause but otherwise not <e>", "<cs> i have to say to the noble lord lord ross that the government do not agree that it is desirable to exclude billiard halls from the licensing requirement and even if it were and even if this amendment was agreed to in fact it would not relieve them and i shall explain why <e> <s> i accept that billiards although i do not think most people go to these places to play billiards these days but snooker or whatever is popular and that most of these establishments are well conducted but they do attract a considerable clientele and on safety grounds alone i think they should be properly regulated <e> <s> at any rate that is what the working party concluded in their report on page and the government have not been urged by anybody except the noble lord to disagree with the working party in its report <e>", "<cs> a pool room is where one resorts to play pool which is not unrelated to billiards <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mackie of benshie seeks to delete <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> a b and c together in order to save time <e> <s> i have a lot of sympathy with the amendments of the noble lords lord ross and lord mackie <e> <s> i emphasise that what is to be regulated here is the commercial element <e> <s> if people merely go to church even if they pack it to the doors such would not come <e>", "<cs> i rather suspect that the noble baroness lady phillips and the noble lord lord howie of troon have not been in their places while <e>", "<cs> i cannot answer hypothetical questions of that nature on a scottish bill <e> <s> when i am <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say that when i read my noble friends amendment i had not realised that he intended to make the obtaining of a licence by a window cleaner a voluntary act <e> <s> in other words what my noble friend says this afternoon is that in these circumstances a window cleaner can obtain a licence or not according to what he wishes <e> <s> equally the licensing of window cleaners would be discretionary so far as the licensing authority was concerned as indeed it already is under the terms of clause <e> <s> i think that my noble friends attempt to find a compromise falls smartly between the two stools and i appreciate the motivation behind the tabling of this amendment <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend is canny enough to persuade his neighbour to clean his windows for bob i do not know how many windows my noble friend has that person is not carrying on the trade of a window cleaner <e> <s> indeed he would very soon go broke <e> <s> therefore the provisions of clause do not come into the picture <e>", "<cs> the distinction is that it is contemplated that the window cleaner might have something nailed to his little ladder <e> <s> that is exhibiting his licence whereas the officer of the authority will produce something from his wallet which identifies him as being in the position which he holds <e> <s> that is the reason for the different language <e>", "<cs> if i may reply to the noble lord lord airedale if he looked at clause he would see how the licensing provisions are set up and precisely what happens in relation to licences <e> <s> and if he and the noble lord lord ross will look at clause they will see what happens if you do not have a licence <e> <s> that is what is at issue not failure to exhibit the licence in clause <e>", "<cs> i do not think the production of the licence at present is the subject of criminal legislation <e> <s> it is the fact of their being licensed which is important <e>", "<cs> i did see the letter in question and it is fair to say that up until now the resources of my department have been wholly exercised in getting the bill through parliament rather than considering what the secretary of state may or may not do once it has received royal assent <e> <s> i understand that we have asked the council for more information about the abuses which they say are a part of these sales <e> <s> so far as i know they are giving the matter their attention <e> <s> but i think that i can give the noble lord the undertaking that if after the bill becomes an act it is shown that these particular sales are an abuse in some way or another or that the activity is one that needs regulation and to be brought into the ambit of licensing under <e>", "<cs> i said comparatively early <e>", "<cs> if my noble friends were in the chamber to appreciate what i went through in relation to window cleaners licences they will know that i would not want to put anything into this bill which was not totally desirable <e> <s> in fact the matter is also being considered in another place in relation to the english bill and i understand that the department of trade are looking at it <e> <s> we shall do so ourselves <e> <s> i adhere to what i said to my noble friend lord drumalbyn <e> <s> we are still at a comparatively early stage so far as this bills passage through both houses of parliament is concerned <e> <s> if the bringing of such activities into the licensing system is thought to be desirable then i can give my noble friends the assurance that the opportunity will be there <e>", "<cs> there is all the difference in the world between soliciting in a bus or soliciting in a train which are conveyances with a certain number of seats and soliciting in a taxi which has only four seats <e> <s> i should have thought that it is obvious <e> <s> i reassure noble lords that this has nothing to do with kerb-crawling <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord reads the words of amendments no <e> <s> b he will see that it includes <e>", "<cs> under the terms of clause a person who in certain circumstances is drunk in a public place with all that that implies is guilty of an offence <e> <s> i remind my noble friend that not only does it include under the terms of clause any place to which the public have unrestricted access including doorways entrances and the common areas of tenement buildings but also includes any place to which at the material time the public are permitted to have access whether on payment or otherwise and any public conveyance other than a taxi or a hire car within the meaning of clause <e>", "<cs> clause gives the owner tenant or occupier of any heritable property in which an offence under clause is being committed a power to apprehend and detain the person involved <e> <s> therefore the position is clear <e> <s> he can apprehend somebody who is drunk on his premises <e> <s> clause which is the definitive part of the clause with which we are dealing allows the owner of a public house as an example to apprehend and detain a drunk on his premises <e> <s> although clause relates back to clause the clause with which we are dealing relates to drunks in public <e> <s> i hope therefore this is now plain to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> the existing provision in the licensing scotland act which clause is designed to replace make it an offence to be drunk in a public place while in charge of a child under the age of seven <e> <s> it is not now known what particular significance if any the age of seven years had at that time <e> <s> i have to confess that the only reason for putting seven in clause is that that is the age which is used in the act <e> <s> i do not know how the noble lord alighted on the age of but i confess that i should like to test the opinion of the committee on this <e> <s> if noble lords feel there is now a case for extending the protection afforded by this section to children between the ages of seven and i think i would accept the amendment so i am in the hands of the committee <e>", "<cs> the committee is clearly of the opinion that this is an amendment which should be accepted and i therefore invite the committee to do just that <e>", "<cs> yes it would <e>", "<cs> this offence although it has grave connotations is essentially what is described as a minor nuisance offence <e> <s> if the offenders actions constitute more than a minor nuisance there are several other much more serious offences which can <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord really thinks that he should go up the scale to and at least he consistent and do that at a later stage <e> <s> i have tried to explain why is quite inappropriate <e>", "<cs> one of the disadvantages of a brief is that one cannot compete with the noble lord although i dare say that the shorthand writers will be grateful <e>", "<cs> the fact is that this is an offence which does not figure too highly in the calendar <e> <s> the noble lord was perfectly right when he said that in stornoway last month a man was convicted of the offence of being drunk in charge of cattle and in july there was what i might call a tam o shanter situation when a person was reported for being drunk in charge of a horse <e> <s> when we were consulting with various authorities as to the contents of this bill the association of chief police officers made representations that although they expected the powers to be infrequently used there would be some advantage in retaining the offence <e> <s> that is why subsection finds its way into the bill <e>", "<cs> the noble lords speech as opposed to the content of his amendment dealt with obscene material in broadcasting and i shall therefore confine myself to broadcasts rather than plays <e> <s> this exemption in respect of television broadcasts by the bbc or iba or indeed radio broadcasts because the two are exactly similar or by way of a diffusion service that is to say local community cable television or subscription television is similar to that contained in section <e>", "<cs> noble lords in the committee have shared the concern of the noble lord lord ross about the very serious problem of solvent abuse <e> <s> the government equally share his concern <e> <s> he is no doubt aware that my right honourable friend the secretary of state recently issued a consultative memorandum which discusses various possible ways of approaching the problem and in particular the role which the childrens hearings system might play <e> <s> members in another place had a very full debate on this issue in the scottish grand committee on rd december <e> <s> so far as the memorandum goes among the matters upon which views were invited was the suggestion that inhalation of solvents should be made a criminal offence and comments on these matters have been sought from a considerable number of bodies <e> <s> we have asked that if possible the comments should reach us by the end of next month <e> <s> it would be premature of me to try to give any indicaton of our thinking before the comments on the memorandum have been received <e>", "<cs> i am with the noble lord in spirit as regards the principle of his amendment but i am not with him in the way in which he has drafted it <e> <s> i think that we have to make one or two inquiries to see what the european parliament is in law <e> <s> so if the noble lord will withdraw his amendment in the meantime i shall consider the matter further and table my own amendment to a similar effect at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i think that one has to take the english as one finds it <e> <s> it says the use <e>", "<cs> this discussion would really be very much better carried on under the mantle of an amendment than an <e>", "<cs> my lords by the time the williams committee submitted their interim report planning for the conversion of the former school for use by the gallery of modern art was already well advanced <e> <s> here thanks are due to the crown estate commissioners who are generously bearing the costs of the conversion <e>", "<cs> my lords i used the word irreversible rather than the word irrevocable <e> <s> what i said was <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the setting of priorities is something on which the government will have to decide bearing in mind the parlous state of our national finances <e> <s> the noble earl lord cromartie also spoke about travelling museums and i agree with much of what he said <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all i entirely agree with my noble friend on the effects which lobster fishing has had upon the people who live in the outer isles whether they are born and bred there or whether they have come back <e> <s> i have in fact not only received delegations of lobster fishermen but have met them on numerous occasions on various trips to the western isles <e> <s> i think that the matters which concern lobster fishermen most are imports of foreign lobsters and imports of foreign lobsters bearing disease <e> <s> in both those situations her majestys government have taken the matter very seriously and we have taken the appropriate action <e>", "<cs> my lords this is really the subject of a wednesday debate rather than a starred question if i may say so but perhaps i could confine the matter to lobster fishermen <e> <s> they are of course entitled to receive all the interest which the government give to fishermen as a whole wherever they may be situated in scotland <e> <s> they will also be entitled to avail themselves of the aid which is to be offered in the new integrated development programme for the western isles details of which are just being completed by my department <e> <s> so far as lobsters are concerned as i have said we have sought to persuade the commission and our partners in the community to impose a reference price system <e> <s> in fact that was not agreed but we are now in the throes if that is the word of working out a scheme of deficiency payments so far as lobsters are concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to say that herring have now reappeared in the minch and there was a fishery last winter <e> <s> it is because we are worried about over-fishing of lobsters in the western isles that for instance we have increased the minimum landing size for lobsters from mm to mm carapace <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i have very regular and cordial contact with the highlands and islands development board and this is one of the means of encouraging commercial developments not only in respect of fishing but of all kinds of commercial activity in the outer isles <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of any scheme by which crofters can obtain compensation as of right for the vagaries of the climate or weather and i do not think it would be appropriate for her majestys government to underwrite any such scheme for fishermen <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should respond briefly to the noble lord lord boothby who we are delighted to see pronouncing upon this penultimate stage of this little bill <e> <s> i think it is no exaggeration to say that the noble lord lord boothby is regarded as the personification of east aberdeenshire not least by the many fisherfolk whom he represented with great distinction and assiduity over many years <e> <s> this bill is the culmination of a great many efforts of a number of people <e> <s> it allows the secretary of state for scotland to disengage from the day-to-day management of peterhead bay harbour for which until now he has been the harbour authority <e> <s> there will now be a new authority who will have all his powers and the responsibility for the harbour will pass in this manner <e> <s> this is a natural and i think proper development in the history of peterhead bay <e> <s> as i said on the second reading of this bill if other harbours in scotland find themselves in similar circumstances then the same procedures can be followed without the necessity for primary legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> it may be convenient if i follow the helpful lead of the noble lord lord ross of marnock and briefly discuss all the amendments down to amendment no <e> <s> e <e> <s> among those i include the two amendments tabled by the noble lord lord mackie of benshie <e> <s> i indicated at second reading that the clauses dealing with local authority powers to regulate public processions were excluded from the bill as it was then published because of the undertakings given by the secretary of state in the green paper on the review of the public order act and related legislation that the provisions in the draft civic government scotland bill which the noble lords amendments would follow save in one respect would be reconsidered in the light of the main review of public order issues <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord like me to reply now <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord is going to withdraw his amendment very soon but i think i should answer the noble lord lord davies of leek if nobody else <e> <s> the points that he made exemplify the difficulties the draftsmen are in <e> <s> on the one hand we have the noble lord lord mackie the salvation army and the noble lord lord davies of leek with his children shouting joyfully <e> <s> may i say that throughout the kingdom the longer the conservative government are in power the more cause they will have to shout joyfully whether in the mountains or on the plains or even dare i say <e> <s> in the region of lothian <e> <s> the fact is that one has to steer a middle course between these entirely laudable and innocent activities and the much less laudable and far more sinister processions which take place dare i say <e> <s> in glasgow which also have unfortunately a religious connotation <e> <s> so that is a problem of drafting and interpretation <e>", "<cs> no i will put down the amendments but they are in draft now <e>", "<cs> if my noble friends point is that in some way this clause as presently drafted transfers the onus of proof from the crown to the accused then i must tell him that that is not so <e> <s> it remains for the crown to lead such evidence as it can to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt in the ordinary way <e> <s> but perhaps it would be best for me to explain the effect of the clause as it is presently drafted <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly take it away and have a look at it <e> <s> there is a difference here between the clause setting out that to which the court must have regard when it comes to make up its mind and the standard that is to say the standard of proof which has to be met before the court can say to itself this case is proved <e> <s> they are two different things <e> <s> however i shall certainly take this away and see whether it can be improved <e>", "<cs> following the report of the scottish law commission there were of course some consultations with a number of interests as the noble lord lord ross has rightly said <e> <s> what came out was that a unified system which seemed to be what the commission envisaged would be likely to lead to greatly increased pressure on police resources <e> <s> this would arise of cow se from the considerable additional workload in keeping records and disposing of property <e> <s> in the present economic climate an additional extraneous administrative burden of this nature simply would not be justified <e>", "<cs> at present the police are required to hold property for six months and there is general agreement that the present holding period is too long <e> <s> consultations with the police established that in practice the vast majority of claims by owners of lost property are made within one month of the article being deposited with the police that very few claims are made after the second month and that hardly any are made thereafter <e>", "<cs> i think that follows but it does not mean to say that merely because the police must have the space available it will necessarily be filled <e>", "<cs> it should be remembered that the figures i gave were for claims not articles so there will be a considerable need for articles to be stored and that will need space <e> <s> my noble friend lord drumalbyn asked about various figures <e> <s> i do not know the answer and i do not think there are general statistics as to what claims are made in any particular period <e> <s> that is why i said the survey which the lothians and borders police carried out was interesting <e> <s> i know from experience that there is considerable liaison between police districts one with another on the question of articles both found and lost and therefore i do not think that that is strictly to the point on this amendment <e> <s> i believe that the mechanism is there for the chief constable to carry out his responsibilities under the clause <e>", "<cs> although the noble lord lord ross did not speak to his next amendment no <e> <s> e what i have to say applies to it just as well as it does to this amendment <e> <s> i understand that the vast majority of persons who lose articles claim them within a matter of weeks and this is particularly so if they are of any value <e> <s> the government believe that if for any reason a person fails to claim his lost article within the required period which we have just discussed and the article is subsequently sold by the police a further year is an adequate period within which the right to compensation should apply and any lengthening of that period would really serve no practical purpose <e> <s> the keeping of records imposes an extra burden on the police and since the right to compensation will not extend beyond one year there is no benefit to be gained by requiring the police to keep records for any longer period <e>", "<cs> the report of the scottish law commission did not recommend a minimum value for eligibility for compensation but the government were attracted by the suggestion in the consultative memorandum which was issued before the report that compensation should be limited to sales to a value over <e> <s> this is partly because it is desirable that some restriction be placed on the demands of police manpower which would be involved in the red tape of processing claims for compensation and maintaining relevant records <e> <s> therefore a scheme of compensation applying to all lost property would be impracticable not least because of the clerical demands on police manpower particularly in relation to articles of minimal value <e> <s> so one has to balance practicality against fairness to the loser <e>", "<cs> i scarcely believe that police departments are going to behave with quite such ill-faith but i will certainly look at this to see whether it should be strengthened <e>", "<cs> there are two issues here really if i have understood what my noble friend and the noble lord lord ross have said <e> <s> first there is the content of this clause and indeed of clause <e> <s> perhaps i can say a word about that <e> <s> clause amends the relevant sections of the dogs act to bring them into line with the provisions of this part of the bill and we are referring of course to lost property <e> <s> so the purchaser of a stray dog will acquire ownership of the dog as he would of any other type of property and the penalty for non-compliance with the requirements of the section of the dogs act dealing <e>", "<cs> i have no doubt that the draftsman will read the <e>", "<cs> i have carefully considered this amendment and i think that it is unnecessary having regard to general notice arrangements in other legislation <e> <s> the procedure for service of notices under this bill is governed by section of the local government scotland act <e> <s> section provides that notices shall be sent by prepaid letter or delivered by hand <e> <s> it also covers proof of service and deals with the difficulties which may arise when the owner of premises is unknown <e> <s> i should emphasise that this procedure also governs or substantially parallels notice provisions in respect of works to make safe dangerous buildings under the buildings scotland act and notices requiring the carrying out of works on houses in serious disrepair under the housing scotland act which are close analogies in existing legislation to the complementary new power given in clause of this bill <e>", "<cs> i accept that the noble lady has tabled this amendment probably in the light of correspondence with me and equally probably because i encouraged her to do so <e> <s> i do not want to discourage her now but i would ask her to withdraw it on the undertaking that i give now that i am going to bring forward an amendment at report stage <e> <s> the reason i ask her to do this is that we have considered the matter since we noted her remarks on second reading and in the light of the correspondence that we have had i am satisfied that it would be preferable to qualify the very wide discretion given to authorities as the clause is presently drafted though not only in the way suggested by the noble lady but also by introducing a reference to the nature of the building itself <e> <s> for instance some repairs may be essential if a building is to be lived in but may be much less necessary if the building is designed for another purpose <e> <s> on the understanding that i shall embrace the noble ladys amendment in a rather wider later amendment i ask her to withdraw her amendment at this stage <e>", "<cs> it is slightly ironic that this clause was included in the bill at the behest of the conservation lobby and along comes the noble lord who is a distinguished figure and holds a position in the national trust for scotland and he now wants to give powers to raze such buildings to the ground <e> <s> i think that i detect the hand of glasgow in this <e> <s> whatever the provenance of this amendment and i accept immediately powers to demolish buildings are necessary in some instances powers are not necessary so far as this bill is concerned because they are held in part iii of the building scotland act which provides for the forthwith demolition of buildings which constitute a danger to residents the public or other property <e>", "<cs> the power that glasgow district council presently have is section of the glasgow streets sewers and buildings consolidation order confirmation act and that contains an emergency power of demolition in the interests of <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may first deal with the point raised by the noble lord lord howie of troon <e> <s> there is a distinction to be made between somebody who is found lurking around a tenement building and who sets himself out to be a window cleaner and somebody who is lurking around a tenement building and who sets himself out as the owner and is intent on laying a pipe <e> <s> it seems to me that there is a distinction to be drawn there <e>", "<cs> i have not had time to consider who is to go the sheriff and what it is that the sheriff is to direct his mind to <e> <s> i was hoping that it would be an amalgam of what the noble lord lord ross of marnock wants and what the noble lord lord howie of troon wants but to be decided by the sheriff <e>", "<cs> at the present rate of striking it is going to be read rather than hear but i take the point made by the noble lord lord hughes <e>", "<cs> of that i am glad <e>", "<cs> i will refrain from commenting on that <e> <s> all these amendments and there are really hang together <e> <s> they all seek to transfer responsibility for stair lighting provision from the district or islands authority to the region or islands authority <e> <s> my noble friend lord stodart who is now in his place reminded us on second reading that his committee in their report recommended a transfer of all lighting functions to regions and islands and that recommendation has been accepted by the government <e> <s> but the major lighting issues have to be seen in the context of the proposed roads scotland bill <e> <s> a consultation document on that bill has already been issued and we are now looking at comments upon it <e> <s> but the provision will not be enacted this session and we felt it desirable that at least we should continue and modernise the stair and common property lighting provisions in the current bill so that powers will be there when the existing powers expire at the end of even if the roads scotland bill has not by then been enacted <e>", "<cs> it is a highly complex matter <e> <s> regional councils have permissive powers to light roads and propose roads for which they will become the highway authority <e> <s> in the areas which are covered by the burgh police acts the district councils have a duty to light all streets and other places where lighting is necessary <e> <s> on the other hand the district councils cannot light roads for which a highway authority is responsible without the latters approval <e>", "<cs> the government have accepted it too <e>", "<cs> i am happy to accept it <e>", "<cs> the clause as drafted limits intrusion into private property for example for the fixing of lights for common property to cases where there is no feasible alternative if local authorities or owners are to fulfil their obligations under clause <e> <s> to permit such intrusion at will and without regard to any alternatives as this amendment would do would in our view be open to abuse <e> <s> we believe therefore that a test of necessity is desirable and i hope that on reflection the noble lord lord ross of marnock will agree <e>", "<cs> i believe that the difference between providing light or maintaining lights is entirely different from that which is contemplated in providing or putting in pipes and ventilation shafts <e> <s> one betokens a great deal more than the other so far as building work is concerned <e> <s> that is why the clauses have been framed rather differently <e> <s> i hope that satisfies the noble lord <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord would be good enough to go back to clause he will see that what the consent goes to is consent for the work not consent for the entry <e> <s> that is why there is an essential difference which relates to the work and not to the entry <e> <s> there are no rights of entry without agreement <e> <s> if one goes on to clause and clause the powers of entry and entry warrants and so on are set out <e> <s> so i do not think if i may say so the noble lord is comparing like with like <e>", "<cs> i think we have to go back and consider the amendments which were tabled by the noble lord lord ross <e> <s> if we go back to clause page line what the noble lord sought to do was to put in the words with the consent of the other owners after the word may <e> <s> with respect i believe that that amendment went to the work and not to the entry into the building <e> <s> the next amendment the noble lord sought to make so far as clause was concerned was on page the first line of subsection that is line on the page <e> <s> again he sought to insert the same words after the word may and again that goes to the work which it is sought to do and not to the entry into the particular part of the land or building <e> <s> i can only repeat what i have said that rights of entry are dealt with later on in this part of the bill <e>", "<cs> if i may deal with lord howie of troons point first the penalty under the litter acts and i use the word advisedly at present is and it is intended to increase the limit of the fine in the criminal justice bill which is presently being considered in another place to that is why it comes about that subsection has a maximum fine of <e> <s> i will not go into the merits or rather the demerits of people who offend against clause as opposed to clause <e> <s> when i used to sit as an honorary sheriff the maximum for that particular offence was so we are marching on to some extent <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may respond to the noble lord <e> <s> there are certain provisions in the criminal justice bill particularly so far as the updating of penalties are concerned which will have application to the whole of great britain <e>", "<cs> it is a united kingdom bill <e>", "<cs> naturally <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether the noble lord lord howie really expects me to respond to that <e> <s> we must keep a sense of proportion about this <e> <s> the purposes of the clause are really to protect the amenities which are enjoyed by all the residents of tenemental property <e> <s> if somebody deposits their junk and then negotiates either with the local authority or with the dustmen for its collection there is no doubt about it that he is to some extent making a minor nuisance of himself and it is not really for me to suggest that he might negotiate before he dumps rather than dump and then negotiate <e>", "<cs> subsection disapplies clause and clause in relation to the cleansing of common property in compliance with a notice under <e>", "<cs> the purpose of this clause is to give the authorised officer of the fire authority the right to take emergency action where there is an immediate risk of fire likely to endanger life because of obstruction to common property giving access to or egress from a building in the event of fire <e> <s> the emergency action includes the right to seize property and it is thought that such a drastic right should be available only where there is an immediate risk <e> <s> if the risk of fire is not immediate then the inspecting officer would have the right to serve a notice in writing under clause requiring the occupier of a premises to comply with the duty imposed on him under subsection within a reasonable time by removing or <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should explain why in the end despite my correspondence with the noble lady my amendment does not go as wide as i at first thought it might and as wide as she would like it to <e> <s> in other words why i have restricted my amendment to clause <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble viscount lord thurso that putting up statues and monuments requires planning permission <e> <s> i would remind my noble friend lord selkirk that this provision comes from section of the edinburgh corporation order confirmation act which enables the district council as it now is to <e>", "<cs> according to the recommendations of the working party a district council should have power as it thinks fit to demolish any statue or monument which it maintains <e> <s> this matter has been thought about <e>", "<cs> i have a certain sympathy with members of the committee when they can point to the nomenclature of certain streets or roads which do not happen to tie in with their particular preferences <e> <s> but the difficulty is to think of a way which will as it were cause the district council to have regard to public susceptibilities in its area and yet will not act as a fatal fetter on its freedom to get on with its statutory powers <e> <s> i think that basically speaking we have to take local councils as being responsible in the matter and accept that when they give these names to roads or streets they are acting in the public interest <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ross seeks an almost draconian effect to non-compliance with the terms of clause <e>", "<cs> normally where a local authority carry out work under the bill they may recover their costs from the owners or occupiers of the premises but it is felt that the cleaning of common stairs should be an exception <e> <s> at present local authorities rarely clean common stairs themselves and when they do so the costs are minimal <e> <s> the administrative expenses of making a recovery would be disproportionate to the amount recovered and a recovery provision is not therefore justified <e> <s> in addition there would need to be an associated provision for appeal to the sheriff this could not he justified having regard to the need to keep trivial matters out of the courts <e>", "<cs> t was waiting for a few cogent reasons to be advanced by noble lords as to why there are sufficient grounds for preventing political parties from negotiating the display of advertisements on land premises or vehicles which are the property of the local authority <e> <s> i shall not go down the by-way with the noble lord lord howie of troon and his graffiti <e> <s> but if a political party wants to advertise something on the back end of a bus why on earth should it not do so <e> <s> i fancy that it is one of our little liberties <e>", "<cs> i take note of what my noble friend asks for <e> <s> i think that a textual memorandum has already been prepared and circulated <e>", "<cs> the bill will have some expenditure implications obviously <e> <s> such expenditure <e>", "<cs> this matter is one that has occupied the scottish office and indeed the crown <e>", "<cs> my lords there is every difference between what the noble lord says and the situation some years ago when we were debating crossbows and things like that <e> <s> i agree that the use of crossbows and of lurchers should be prohibited by statute but because of the act we are well down that particular path already so far as scotland is concerned <e> <s> what we would be legislating for or what the secretary of state would be legislating for in his order is for instance the type of rifle to be used <e> <s> that is quite different <e> <s> we need primary legislation for that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am coming to that that is the night shooting point <e> <s> what i was trying to cover was the question of a code of practice <e> <s> we shall come back to that but i have no doubt that it can be covered by the red deer commission and that there is no need for primary legislation <e>", "<cs> yes that point is so my lords <e> <s> i think that the reasons are plain <e> <s> i was asked by the noble viscount lord thurso about red deer commission observers on deer panels <e> <s> the government are of the opinion that particularly if the role of the deer commission is to be enlarged these local panels will be a very useful means of obtaining local advice on management and where necessary and perhaps more importantly control <e> <s> observers will be necessary to ensure that the panels policies are reasonably uniform and reflect the policy of the commission as a whole <e> <s> i would regard that as a worthwhile idea <e>", "<cs> my lords i have had my attention drawn to the article in question <e> <s> i do not think that what my noble friend is saying is the case <e> <s> the government are conscious of the need to preserve the attractiveness of the north sea as an area for new investment <e> <s> they arc examining as part of the review of the taxation rgime the evidence which the industry has put forward in support of its contention that the rgime is inhibiting development <e> <s> the matter of depletion policy is also being reviewed and an announcement will be made in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say by way of preliminary that it is not this provision in this schedule which enables a non-natural person to hold a licence <e> <s> therefore even if this provision were deleted from the paragraph it would not have the effect for instance of stopping a company from holding a licence a company or indeed a partnership is a person in law <e> <s> it would require a specific and i suggest a highly undesirable exclusion to prevent companies or partnerships or whatever from being licence-holders <e> <s> in fact the provisions in this part of the schedule are based on similar provisions in the licensing scotland act which relate not unnaturally to liquor licensing <e> <s> so far as i am aware they have not created any particular problems <e> <s> the reason for having the requirement in the schedule for an application from a firm or company to name the employee with day-to-day responsibility is that it enables the police to consider whether or not he is a fit person to manage or oversee the activity <e> <s> it also enables the police or the fire authority to know who they should approach in the event of an emergency <e> <s> where the licensee is a named individual person he may be contacted at his home address which will be known to the police if there is an emergency <e> <s> if the licensee were a company or a partnership with premises which one assumes would be quite frequently unmanned at night or at week-ends or holidays there would be no known person whom the police could contact in the event of an emergency <e> <s> those are the reasons for drafting the sub-paragraph in this way <e> <s> i suggest that they are compelling reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords there have been criticisms of the drafting of the bill to the effect that it is both cumbersome and bureaucratic and the noble lord lord ross would probably count himself among the critics <e>", "<cs> i am heartened to hear that my lords <e> <s> in any event if the amendment were accepted it would result in a considerable amount of extra work for those concerned with the making scrutiny and disposal of licence applications <e> <s> whatever the criticisms of the bill and its procedures may be the situation would not be helped by adding to the duties of the licensing authority which is what the amendment would do <e> <s> what it would not do would be to confer on neighbouring proprietors or community councils a right they do not already posesss <e> <s> they can already make objections and representations as seem appropriate to them and if those objections are reasonable there is no reason to doubt that they are taken into consideration by the licensing authority <e> <s> however the amendment would impose on licensing authorities an absolute duty to consider through not necessarily to accept objections or representations from those services <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord objects to the schedule otherwise he would not have moved that it be deleted from the bill but what he does not say is what he would do by way of providing any alternative provisions for the licensing authorities to adopt because what the bill does is to set up licensing provisions in some cases mandatory in most cases optional where the licensing authority have resolved that this or that activity should be licensed <e> <s> so what schedule does is to set out the procedures to be followed with regard to the licensing of these various activities and it provides for the submission of applications for dealing with objections and representations for the disposal of applications for the issue of temporary licences for the duration of licences for the notification of changes and alterations affecting licences and for the variation and suspension of licences and it sets out the appropriate fees for licences and appeals to the sheriff <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not a drafting amendment <e> <s> the purpose of these amendments was to remove a provision which we do not think is justified in this bill <e> <s> i shall certainly have a look at the drafting <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has said the effect of his amendment would be that not only taxi but also hire car licensing would be mandatory <e> <s> he does not produce much in the way of arguments <e>", "<cs> arguments at all my lords i would say as to why this form of licensing should be mandatory except in respect of the condition of the taxi and possibly of the driver <e> <s> i concede that licensing is highly desirable at least in the urban areas and there are at present a number of anomalies where district councils such as eastwood do not license taxis or hire cars <e> <s> this then produces a problem about unlicensed pirates and that disturbs the nearby licensed trade <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not got the exact figures on hire cars but i believe that out of authorities do not license them <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i could perhaps answer my noble friends point before the noble lord lord ross decides what he will do about his amendment <e> <s> i want to say to my noble friend that we are continuously being berated for not allowing the democratically elected local authorities to get on with their functions and to do their best by the local citizenry <e> <s> but this is precisely what we are doing in this particular instance <e> <s> may i remind the house that there are only two areas where mandatory licensing is going to apply <e> <s> those are in respect of public entertainment provisions and metal dealing two very diffierent activities <e> <s> the first relates simply and solely to public safety and the second to crime prevention <e> <s> in all other areas of licensing it will be for the local authority to decide what is best for its own area <e> <s> so if my noble friend lord drumalbyn says that this is vague legislation i must say that it is vague only because it will give local authorities freedom to do what is right in their judgement <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships may recall that we had a very full debate in committee on this subject on th december last <e> <s> i expressed the view which i think was generally accepted by the committee that geenrally speaking it is not really the duty of licensing authorities to impose quantitative restrictions on licences in restraint of trade unless there arc very good and valid reasons for them so doing and above all that they should not by the restriction of licences create value where none should be created <e> <s> that part of the argument really goes to the transferability of licences rather than the actual licensing of the vehicle and we have not at this stage of the bills passage got an amendment down for that <e> <s> whether that is for a reason i know not but i have my suspicions <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ross of marnock withdrew an identical amendment at committee stage and i had hoped that my arguments on that occasion had been completely persuasive <e> <s> i was wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords the working party recommended that second-hand dealers should have the right to detain anyone offering articles thought to have been stolen or unlawfully obtained <e> <s> in addition to accepting this recommendation we thought it prudent to protect the second-hand dealer who had acted in good faith against the possibility of civil action arising from the detention of a suspect <e> <s> we felt and still feel that without this provision in the bill the dealer would feel unable to act even when he had good reason because he would not be protected against a civil action for what may have been a genuine mistake <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord ross gets too indignant about the plight of the poor scrap metal merchants i hope that he will cast his eyes downwards to my amendment no <e> <s> to which i have already spoken where he will see that in fact there is considerable flexibility of approach which will be at the discretion of the licensing authority <e> <s> in other words if amendment no <e> <s> is agreed to this amendment will be totally unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords it is as broad as it is long <e> <s> either the unfortunate itinerant metal dealer goes to all the licensing authorities where he wants to ply his trade which means that the authorities have to deal with every application as it comes along or else one has it as we have made it in the bill as long as the itinerant metal dealer behaves himself that is the end of the matter but if he is convicted the court which convicts him has to inform the licensing authority and that has to inform all the others <e> <s> there is not much in it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ross has spoken very forcefully on a matter which certainly has aroused widespread public concern over recent months <e> <s> there are a relatively small number of so-called sex shops which have opened in scotland in recent months compared with those down <e>", "<cs> my lords it is already possible for a local authority to restrict the scope of the street trading licence to an area designated by them and the proposed amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> the bill makes it clear in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may just respond very briefly to the noble lord lord ross i am glad he welcomed the amendment albeit not over-enthusiastically <e> <s> i have to point out that subsection was an illustrative list it was never intended to be exhaustive <e> <s> but what has become absolutely apparent is that the list confuses the casual reader who does think that it is an exhaustive list rather than an illustrative list <e> <s> even the noble lord lord ross was prone to fall into that trap <e> <s> therefore we shall do away with the list and there will be no list and therefore the various licensing authorities will have to rely on clause in concluding the criteria and the exclusions to which i have an amendment in a few moments <e> <s> of course an open air place of public entertainment can fall into the definition just as much as somewhere with a roof <e> <s> i am considering the question of guidance which has been suggested by the noble lord but once you get to guidance you look as if you are getting into lists and once you get into lists then we have all the trouble that we have been discussing in committee and tonight <e> <s> i can give the noble lord this undertaking that if we can make things easier for the licensing authorities then i am sure we shall attempt to do so <e>", "<cs> it may be for the assistance of the committee i make no remark as to the desirability or otherwise of the amendment if i said a word or two about enclosed land which causes a lot of difficulty <e> <s> enclosed woodland causes equally as much <e> <s> so far as i know there is no statutory definition of either term <e> <s> a number of courts have sought to interpret it in particular in an english case called <e>", "<cs> i hope so far as the salary part of this is concerned that i do not need to go into it at great length <e> <s> members of the red deer commission are not paid salaries <e> <s> the only person who is paid a salary is the chariman <e> <s> whatever the inclinations of the secretary of state and i have one former one in front of me and another behind the treasury are never going to allow them to distribute largesse with a very free hand <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord lord houghton saying that your lordships are so mentally incapacitated no doubt through age or other infirmity as not to be able to deal with this matter of the secretary of state having a discretion over the chairman of the red deer commission who may have been <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend has said in effect this is a matter on which the government wanted to get as wide a reaction as possible <e> <s> that is why it was one of the matters in the consultative paper which my department published last year <e> <s> the idea got a mixed reception as far as deer farming is concerned <e> <s> there was a good deal of concern particularly among some sections of the public who felt that if deer are to be farmed at all they should be subject to special protection <e> <s> this is something which we would wish and on which we have started to consult the farm animal welfare council before taking any legislative action <e>", "<cs> your lordships may have noticed that all those that have the welfare of animals at heart tend not to keep their remarks concise to the point and able to be digested by an audience and embodied either in a green paper a white paper or legislation easily or at all <e> <s> in those circumstances what is a complicated and difficult matter is being considered by the body which advises the government on these things <e> <s> we want to get it right <e> <s> i cannot give an undertaking in respect of possible legislation which is not going to see the light of day until we have received the advice and the government have had the chance of making up their mind <e> <s> if the noble lord thinks i am not going far enough that is a matter for him <e> <s> i am being realistic and honest <e> <s> it is of no use the government legislating until they have the expert opinion and they have not got it yet <e>", "<cs> perish the thought that i should make an attack on the noble lord lord houghton <e> <s> if i sent a bonnet sailing into the air and it happened to land on lord houghtons head and it fits that is not my fault <e> <s> behind the noble lords droll sense of humour i agree with a great deal of what he has said so far as the matter is concerned <e> <s> i can assure him that there is no delay and i take his point that one does not want deer farmers to invest too much money and gain too much expertise which may lead to practices which will have to be altered in the light of a forthcoming bill <e> <s> we do not want to go too far down that road before we have the legislation <e>", "<cs> i know that the noble lord lord northfield put a great deal of thought and careful work into these amendments and i have no doubt a lot of research as well <e> <s> if the bill becomes an act in the form that i should like to see i am fairly sure that when the secretary of state comes to make his first batch of regulations a lot of the noble lords careful work will be reflected in them <e> <s> but i am bound to say that i do not think the noble lord has fully appreciated the differences between scotland and england and the fact that we have different ways of doing things and dare i say it even a different nfu which takes a decidely different view of small farmers from the english one <e>", "<cs> my noble friend will know that any orders or regulations made under the act are subject to negative resolution <e> <s> the same would normally apply to the provisions of this bill <e> <s> this amendment would therefore make an exception in the case of firearms which would be subject to affirmative resolution <e> <s> it is right to say that one must pay attention to the fact that there will be considerable consultations in scotland before an order is made <e> <s> it follows from that scotland being a small country and the number of people who take an interest in matters of this kind being limited that everybody will know and appreciate what is in the wind long before it actually comes to the table of your lordships house and to the other place <e> <s> so that there is no question of anything slipping through on the nod without people who might well object to the provisions of such an order having the chance to get in touch with somebody in either house and have the matter discussed <e>", "<cs> if i give to my noble friend an undertaking that i will think about it perhaps he will consider withdrawing the amendment for the time being <e>", "<cs> i agree with what the noble lord has said and i would ask my noble friend to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> there is great strength of feeling in the house on this matter <e> <s> it seems only but a minute since i was sitting where the noble lord lord ross of marnock is seated now and was gazing across at the noble lord lord northfield as he was propounding this over the english legislation which i as a scot was perfectly happy to debate <e>", "<cs> i gave an undertaking to my noble friend who has already proposed that these regulations should be by the affirmative resolution procedure that i would think very carefully about it <e> <s> i shall think even more carefully following the contribution of the noble lord lord houghton <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ponsonby may like to guess as to the subject matter of the amendment which is now before the house <e> <s> i have to tell him that it deals no more and no less with window cleaners and how if at all they should be regularised in the way in which they carry out their arduous and highly skilled duties <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may respond to the noble lord lord ross <e> <s> when we debated this matter in committee the noble lord lord howie of troon was particularly exercised by what i think he called a young fellow trying to turn an honest penny for his own profit during the school holidays <e> <s> what the noble lord was seeking to do and also the noble lord lord ross at that stage was to try to make some differentiation between what i might call a professional window cleaner and an amateur window cleaner or possibly a more accurate description would be a casual window cleaner that is to say someone who for one reason or another was turning an honest penny by cleaning somebodys windows <e>", "<cs> my lords that will be attended to in the next print of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords we have run the gamut of everything from temperance walks to football matches in which an air of temperance pervades nowadays by law <e> <s> the difficulty in devising this legislation is between reconciling the public order considerations this is public order legislation that we are considering and the other considerations which have prompted many noble lords to speak in support of this amendment because they feel quite genuinely that there are <e>", "<cs> my lords as my amendments are written of course it would not be exempted unless and until the regional council felt that it should he and i rather doubt whether it would <e> <s> under the amendment that is proposed by the noble viscount lord thurso if they could claim as they obviously would that their procession was commonly or customarily held then no question of exemption would arise and indeed no question of stopping them from having a procession would arise unless the local authority the regional council found out about the march which one assumes it would and then issued a requirement so that application would have to be made <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i should ask for the leave of the house <e> <s> if i may say so i think that procession is what it means in english <e> <s> it is a procession in public and subsection states that it means a procession in a public place <e> <s> the motivation whether it is something that exercises my noble friend or the noble lord lord underhill whose point i am afraid i forgot to answer is neither here nor there except in relation to the attitude of the local authority <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble viscount sits down i do not want there to be any misunderstanding about this <e> <s> i cannot undertake to provide the new wording by third reading <e> <s> these clauses are very difficult to draft <e> <s> i spent most of this morning going through these and they will have to be considered at very considerable length once the bill leaves your lordships house and goes to another place <e> <s> i cannot give an undertaking to find a satisfactory form of words by third reading to reflect the wishes of the noble viscount and i should be dishonest if i pretended that i could <e>", "<cs> my lords what i meant was that the government would look at this <e> <s> as most noble lords now know this represents a desire on the part of the government to write into this bill these clauses which we regard as being very important although we are doing so ahead of the english and ahead of the final thoughts following the report of the noble and learned lord lord scarman <e> <s> as i said at <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord howie of troon puts his argument so attractively that it is difficult to say no to him <e> <s> i would never have guessed that in considering the duties of a council and their responsibilities under public order considerations we would end up talking about increased prices at golf courses in and around ayr and troon and in another place whose name i did not quite catch <e>", "<cs> i am sure that it is a very nice place <e> <s> however i really do not believe that the strathclyde regional council which will no doubt allocate these public order considerations to the appropriate committee are going to look at these matters in some distant and less sympathetic way than a district council would <e> <s> what they have to do when applying their minds under this new clause is to take the applications which may have been made do the various things which they are enjoined to do and then come up with a solution <e> <s> whether the local scouts in let us say troon are going to get blanket exemption in respect of their procession or whether the troon orange order if there is such a thing is to be allowed to have some sort of celebration march around the golf courses is really neither here nor there <e>", "<cs> my lords quite frankly i do not know <e> <s> i shall find out <e> <s> what i am pretty certain of is that the disaffected citizen who has not received permission to hold his procession is entitled to choose his sheriff and to try to find one who he thinks will be more sympathetic to his cause than another <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to deal with the point raised by the noble lord lord howie of troon <e> <s> if mary queen of scots is approached by an officer in uniform and asked to desist i shall not go into the terms of the actual language used and refuses so to do and i exclude for the purposes of this debate her age her responsibility for her criminal acts and so on and refer to any <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose that he might be dressed as something else too <e> <s> in those circumstances the offence would not be complete because it is only complete when somebody who takes part in a procession is asked to desist by a police constable in uniform <e> <s> therefore an officer in plain clothes would not be entitled to make the demand except in so far as he could as a police officer perhaps do so to protect a public order situation which might be turning ugly <e> <s> but certainly in terms of this subsection she would not commit an offence <e>", "<cs> my lords we did go into this matter after the committee stage of the bill and i think that the noble lord lord ross and i agreed that the present holding period of six months is too long <e> <s> therefore we had to have a period which is long enough to allow owners to claim their property but short enough to ensure that the police are not inconvenienced by being required to store a large amount of property to no purpose <e> <s> any lengthening of the storage period will make an additional demand on storage space <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i must reiterate that these are fairly crude figures because not every police force has made these inquiries or carried out the researches <e> <s> however lothian and borders police found that approximately per cent <e> <s> of claims related to items lodged within the previous two months <e> <s> the noble lord is quite right that leaves per cent <e> <s> in the period between two and three months <e> <s> if one took that figure and applied it to the whole of scotland it would represent about claims <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that possibly both the noble lord and i are trespassing upon the indulgence of this house and turning this into the equivalent of a committee stage <e> <s> i think that we should look at the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i have no statistics for this debate but i hope that i have some compelling reasons and unassailable logic <e> <s> i assume that the noble lord lord ross would agree with me that there is no point in keeping records unless they serve some purpose <e> <s> the right of a previous owner of lost property to compensation in the event of a sale of his property lasts for one year under clause of this bill <e> <s> the right of the owner to reclaim his property in the event of disposal for other than value in other words where it is returned to the finder lasts for only one year under clause <e> <s> it is only to meet such claims that records need to be kept and to do so without this purpose really would be a quite unjustified burden on police resources <e>", "<cs> my lords i might have hoped that the amendments which follow in my name would have removed any anxiety that the noble lady might have had on this score because what they do if i may refer to them briefly is to provide that the powers in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not going down the highways and byways of the desirability of one form of development or another with the noble lord if he will forgive me <e> <s> what we are talking about here are statues and monuments <e> <s> i have tried to explain that there are two considerations <e> <s> if the council want to make what they consider to be better use of the site they will have to go through the planning hoops and the local citizenry will find out about it <e> <s> if they want to demolish a statue or a monument because it is dangerous it is unreasonable to expect <e>", "<cs> my lords i had assumed in my innocence that this was a simple drafting amendment by which the noble lord lord ross with his usual eager eye was anxious to assist the government and i am prepared to accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are going to take it up now <e> <s> i hesitate to spoil the fun but if the noble lady and the noble lord lord howie of troon had cast their eyes two amendments further down they would have seen a government amendment which does what is sought to be done by the noble lady and the noble lord but the phraseology is possibly a little more felicitous <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross has also put down an amendment which is sandwiched between the other two and it may shorten the proceedings i say may in hope if i speak to the amendment of the noble lord lord ross as well as to that of the noble lady lady saltoun and my own <e>", "<cs> my lords i will take the noble ladys amendment away if she will agree to withdraw it at this stage because i still think it is somewhat clumsy <e>", "<cs> my lords the exemption for receptacles which are normally located in a public place including premises to which the public have right of access is intended to exempt such things as what i think are called shells in glasgow

may have noticed large usually ugly and garish fibre glass animals with small slits in them into which he is invited to put his small change for purely charitable purposes in most instances <e>", "<cs> my lords on the last occation when we considered this matter i said that i was waiting for a few cogent reasons to be advanced as to why there are sufficient grounds for preventing political parties from negotiating for the display of advertisements on land premises or vehicles which are the property of the local authority <e> <s> this amendment is even more narrowly defined than the last but i still come back to the original question is the amendment necessary and what is the evil or abuse which it seeks to correct <e> <s> if the desire of the noble lord lord underhill is to ensure that there is proper conduct during an election period then i doubt whether such consideration is proper in the context of this bill or of any local government bill <e> <s> in fact it would be much more appropriate for legislation in the representation of the people acts <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked for it and he will get it <e> <s> certain provisions of paragraph of schedule c to the roads and bridges scotland act make it an offence to fly kites play games and so on in any street to the annoyance of any other person <e> <s> the working party on civic government considered similar provisions in section of the burgh police scotland act and recommended that since the flying of kites was unlikely to be a danger or annoyance to the public generally that that offence should be allowed to lapse but that the playing of games where annoyance or obstruction is caused or is likely to be caused to passers-by should continue to be an offence <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord howie of troon <e> <s> in fact these penalties were increased to in the criminal law act <e>", "<cs> my lords what i am trying to tell the noble lord is that the offences being repealed are now covered in clause <e> <s> the remaining provisions various nuisance provisions from the old paragraph are being reviewed <e> <s> i am afraid that i do not have a list of them but if i am wrong about this i will of course write to the noble lord directly <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ross of marnock tabled an identical amendment on report <e> <s> we discussed the matter at that time and i have to say at once that i now have the same view as i then had <e> <s> by his amendment the noble lord seeks to enable all dealers in ferrous metal to be free to dispose of or process any such metal at any time without having to wait for the expiration of the retention period of hours or having to seek a dispensation from the licensing authority under the terms of clause <e> <s> that was a provision which we inserted on report and which i think went a long way to meet any possible objections <e>", "<cs> let me finish <e> <s> what i intend to tell the noble lord is that consistent with the theme which runs through the bill it is up to the local authority to exercise its discretion in a way which meets local demands and circumstances <e> <s> that is a much better way than to have the very broad brush approach of the english legislation which once somebody has been convicted then provides the retention period for all classes of metal <e> <s> i consider and i advise the house that we have reached a better way of dealing with the matter <e> <s> obviously the scrap metal trade is concerned about the possible implications of this part of the bill but i hope that it will see that this is much the most sensible way of going about it <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that the noble lords amendment makes the subsection more readily intelligible and i am happy to accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind what the noble viscount lord thurso has said i have listened on three occasions to the arguments put by the noble lord lord underhill i hope sympathetically and i hope that some others equally will listen to my argument <e> <s> what i have to say is similar if not identical to what i have said previously <e> <s> if this amendment or something like it is needed at all and i do not accept that it is i have heard no cogent evidence that it is my point and the governments point is that it is not the way to legislate to put a provision such as this into a bill such as this <e> <s> a more suitable vehicle would be in the context of representation of the people legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e> <s> it seems a long time since we had our second reading debate in november <e> <s> since then we have considered some amendments and it is perhaps appropriate to look back briefly to what we have done <e> <s> i must at once acknowledge that the bill is a better bill than when it was introduced and i pay tribute to your lordships contributions <e> <s> i have to say that a few have even responded to the invitation generously issued by the noble lord lord ross of marnock at second reading in which he suggested that the bill was too important to be left to the scots and he cordially invited all noble lords to participate in the committee stage <e> <s> fortunately perhaps that invitation fell on some deaf ears but we have been glad to welcome in particular the noble lord lord underhill to our debates <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank noble lords who have taken part in this ultimate stage of the bill so far as this part of the proceedings is concerned <e> <s> i am glad that noble lords have acknowledged at any rate i think they have the flexibility of the government <e> <s> of course all these matters where the situation may not be entirely satisfactory as the noble lord lord howie of troon for instance has exemplified over window cleaners will be considered and reconsidered <e> <s> of that i have no doubt <e> <s> as i have said on a number of occasions on this bill it is difficult in setting up a licensing scheme such as this to have regard to those principles which we want to observe to have regard to the rights of the individual and at the same time to avoid setting up a bureaucratic machine which would be welcome to nobody <e> <s> i freely acknowledge that in certain areas i do not think we have solved all the problems but that is one of the points of having two houses of parliament <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can help the noble viscount <e> <s> i am not anxious to trespass on to the field of amendment no <e> <s> because that is an amendment which will come up in its own right very soon <e> <s> however if the noble viscount glances at amendment no <e> <s> he will see what what is proposed in my noble friends amendment is that the licensing of venison dealers should be dealt with under the terms of the bill <e> <s> which one hopes will have become an act by then in exactly the same way as other trades are dealt with <e> <s> for the reasons which i think my noble friend has given there must be consultations as to who is to be involved and so on and that can be done quite happily by order after the bill becomes a act <e>", "<cs> perhaps i did not make myself plain <e> <s> however as the noble lord lord ross will recollect as regards the civic government scotland bill one of the first provisions of any code is that application is followed very soon after by a referral to the chief constable <e> <s> so of course the chief constable will be brought into the matter <e>", "<cs> as this really goes more to government policy than to my noble friend perhaps i may put in a word at this juncture <e> <s> if clause was going to come into effect within one month after this bill was passed then of course we should need to insert into the bill something by way of a dealers records so <e>", "<cs> i am really not over-concerned with the english legislation <e> <s> what i am concerned with is how to marry up this bill to the civic government scotland bill and how to produce at the end of the day a form which we all recognise will have to be made in the best possible way <e> <s> i am not even sure bearing in mind that the deer act has not been in force for very long that it is safe to say that the form is entirely satisfactory although i appreciate at once the noble lords point that it seems to be having a beneficial effect so far as poachers are concerned <e> <s> i should also prefer to hear that it is having a beneficial effect on venison dealers and the maintenance of their businesses <e> <s> one must therefore look at it in the round <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should respond to that <e> <s> it is no secret that the red deer commission have advocated the adoption of a statutory carcase movement record <e> <s> i think also it is no secret that the government are far from convinced that it would he a cost-effective measure <e> <s> i appreciate what my noble friend says and it is true that if every movement of a carcase is recorded both at the point where it is shot and where it is delivered to a dealer false information given to the dealer will show up as a discrepancy in the records <e> <s> the system could of course be evaded not least if there were collusion but that is not the point <e>", "<cs> perhaps my noble friend would enlighten the committee <e> <s> as the snaring of deer is illegal in any event may i ask him whether he thinks anybody when they come to sell the carcase will put on a record that they have snared it <e>", "<cs> no i did not want to interrupt i am too polite to do that <e> <s> this is the committee stage and i was going to come in and say that i thought i had given the undertaking in absolutely plain terms that we shall be making consultations <e> <s> i want the noble lord to withdraw the amendment so that we can make the necessary consultations <e> <s> i cannot accept his amendment because we have not made consultations <e>", "<cs> this amendment goes to a principle of scottish law and certainly government policy and therefore i am going to respond at this stage <e> <s> this is another manifestation of the noble lords desire to make all penalties available for all offences <e> <s> the committee has already rejected that in principle <e> <s> what the amendment seeks to do so far as section a is concerned is to extend the penalty of the loss of a firearms certificate to convictions under part iiia which is entirely concerned with the venison trade <e> <s> i accept that somebody selling venison without a licence may also be shooting the beasts himself and may be committing another offence <e> <s> in the circumstances it would be right i suppose that he should forfeit or run the risk of forfeiting his gun licence <e> <s> but all that can be provided for in the penalties for poaching and so on <e> <s> it is independent of the venison dealing side of the mans activities <e> <s> so i accept section a only in part <e>", "<cs> the invitation of my noble kinsman is too much to resist <e> <s> i shall not reply substantially to this amendment because it is my noble friends bill and i do not know what he will do faced on the one hand with the scylla of the noble lord lord northfield who has plenty of support in the committee and on the other hand with the charybdis of my noble kinsman who has said precisely perhaps in elegant terms but nevertheless in realistic fashion what will happen to the bill if the amendment is accepted as it stands <e> <s> so that is a whirlpool and a rock past which this little bill has to sail <e>", "<cs> i have sat silent for some time but i resent the allegations of impropriety bad faith foistering some kind of pantomime and charade on the house and so on <e> <s> for reasons with which i do not need to weary the committee there are occasions when the parliamentary timetable does not allow bills to go forward in the way that one might have hoped and as i have frequently pointed out particularly in matters regarding animals opinions are held wih great passion and i do not say that in any derogatory sense <e> <s> but when one comes to a matter such as this i think that it is better debated without the whips on on a free vote where each noble lord is able to speak as his conscience and his interest demand <e> <s> if the noble lord is hinting that there has been anything improper in the way that the bill has been presented to your lordships i deny that <e> <s> this is a perfectly proper way and it is probably a way in which eventually the feelings of the house will become more apparent than would happen with an ordinary government bill <e>", "<cs> the forestry commission will be the beneficiary if i may describe it as such of this part of the clause <e> <s> the forestry commission has come in for a certain amount of criticism this evening and therefore notwithstanding the valiant efforts of the noble lord lord john-mackie to put the balance right i think it proper that i should comment on the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not want the noble lord or indeed the house to be under any misapprehensions about this matter <e> <s> the certifying authority for the ben ocean ranger will be the american bureau of shipping <e> <s> we have to appreciate that the cause of the loss of the ocean ranger is not yet known <e> <s> it is therefore premature to call into question the validity of safety assessments by the american bureau of shipping <e> <s> in the case of the ben ocean ranger the american bureau of shipping will be applying united kingdom requirements and in certain areas they involve a more comprehensive assessment of the design than that required to meet the classification rules <e> <s> in some areas the united kingdoms exceptions criteria are more stringent <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot possibly give any such undertaking because we do not know what results if any the inquiries into the tragic loss of the ocean ranger will reveal <e>", "<cs> my lords we have established contact with the canadian authorities investigating the incident and we shall be informed of the findings as and when they are known <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that these are questions which will occupy a great deal of time and energy on the part of the canadian authorities in establishing the facts of how this tragedy occurred <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first thank noble lords who have given this bill a general welcome <e> <s> the debate has been an interesting one and of course it has gone down avenues which are slightly broader than the subject matter of this bill <e> <s> for instance mention has been made by several noble lords of the recent report of the select committee on energy <e> <s> as the house will know the government have not yet adopted a stance and as it were given a reply to the select committee although it is true to say that my right honourable friend felt bound by a letter dated th march to write to the chairman pointing out a number of misunderstandings of fact and that letter was made public <e>", "<cs> my lords when a decision comes and the noble lord who has been either in government or at any rate on the periphery if i may so describe a lord in waiting knows <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a bit nearer the centre <e> <s> but at the centre of government decisions like this are for the government and i can say no more <e> <s> may i get on to liquefaction <e> <s> this government have never swerved from their commitments to the boards oil-from-coal project <e> <s> in may last year <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the noble lords point <e> <s> the next matter was the question of long term investment which the noble lord said is inhibited by a concentration on short term cash limits <e> <s> this takes us to the financial guidelines which we set <e> <s> the board are given these as to their external financing limits and their capital approval <e> <s> the boards capital investment is continuing at a substantial level <e> <s> i said in my opening remarks that their capital this year had been approved at million and that next year it would be million <e> <s> however commitment to the boards future which these figures represent does not minimise the need to set the board some financial guidelines in the form of external financing limits <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may deal first with the last part of my noble friends supplementary i do not think that it would be either desirable or practicable in the present circumstances to have a plan such as my noble friend envisages <e> <s> so far as the first part of his supplementary question is concerned one has to distinguish between the licensing stage and the planning considerations that follow it <e> <s> so far as the latter are concerned once the department of energy which is concerned with the issuing of licences has completed its role it as it were stands aside <e> <s> it is then for the local authority and in proper cases for the department of the environment where the planning application is called in to play their part in the planning procedures <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i do not accept the first part of the noble lords question <e> <s> however it is clearly important in this uncertain world for the government to establish so far as is possible the extent and location of our reserves of oil <e>", "<cs> my lords i would describe the governments approach as <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend seeks to argue and i am answering questions of fact <e> <s> i do not agree <e>", "<cs> not without notice my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may respond to the noble lord because this is a matter which goes rather further than the actual subject of this bill <e> <s> i say by way of preface that i am at one with the noble lord when he expresses his detestation of poaching and the cruelty which frequently accompanies it <e> <s> i appreciate the fact that what he is seeking to do by this amendment is to stiffen section of the act <e> <s> but i would hope to show him that in at least one instance what he seeks to do is unnecessary in another it may be desirable but is something to be decided at a later stage of this bill and that in the third instance what he seeks to do is otiose according to scottish law and the way in which we in scotland comport ourselves <e> <s> i shall come to all those <e>", "<cs> my lords i disagree with the noble lord <e> <s> if injuring a deer is not an act preparatory to taking it i do not know what is <e> <s> coming now to subsection that does very little but re-enact what we have already in the existing section <e> <s> i agree that the noble lord has a point here <e> <s> there is one particular difference which in effect is the offence of removal of <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i could satisfy the house on this point <e> <s> other equipment though i do not want to trespass on amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i should point out that this amendment was prompted by my noble friend lord burton <e> <s> i undertook to consider the matter of affirmative resolutions <e> <s> governments of whatever complexion do not like affirmative resolutions very much because they take up parliamentary time <e> <s> it is much easier from the point of view of the executive if somebody wanting to challenge subordinate legislation has to move a prayer <e> <s> but in the circumstances it was thought that your lordships might well want to debate an order made under this section without the necessity of having to pray against it and i felt all things considered that the affirmative procedure would be appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will recollect that we had quite a full debate on this matter in committee <e> <s> i sympathised then with the noble lord lord northfield in his desire to curtail the use of the shotgun <e> <s> i still do not think there is anything or if anything nothing very much between us <e> <s> no responsible body of opinion maintains that a shotgun is a suitable weapon for sporting use against deer <e> <s> that is for sure <e> <s> but i think i can claim from the way he has put down and tabled his amendment and the phraseology which he has used that the noble lord reluctantly concedes as i do as we all have to that it continues to be a disagreeable necessity for the purposes of crop protection <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i should just say something for the benefit of those members of the animal welfare lobby who do not read <e>", "<cs> well if they do block this in the other place at four oclock on a friday afternoon we shall just go back to the act and the very real concessions which are being made by the farming lobby will be lost <e> <s> i say no more <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord northfield has said this amendment is very similar to that which he moved in committee <e> <s> he now has an ambition to extend the relaxation to offences under part iii of the act that is to say covering the poaching killing at night and unlawful killing of deer <e> <s> i vigorously opposed the noble lord at committee stage and i had the support of the noble lord lord ross of marnock and i vigorously oppose him now <e> <s> i do so even more vigorously because i have looked up what occurred at committee stage when the act was going through <e> <s> there was one and a half hours of heated debate in another place <e> <s> i hope that i am not being too rude when i say that sometimes they conduct their debates like the mad hatters tea party <e> <s> at one moment rather like the dormouse <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for hesitation on my part because i really had thought that on the last occasion that your lordships debated this matter in committee i had given a good and useful undertaking of what the government were prepared to do <e> <s> i do not want to say anything which is at variance with what i said on that occasion which was carefully considered and which i had hoped and indeed from the reaction of the committee i had concluded was going to be satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know either <e> <s> what i assume it to be is that the vehicle which eventually turns up at the dealers premises may not necessarily bear any relation to the vehicle which was actually used either in connection with the killing of the deer or in its transporation <e> <s> therefore the details in such form might well be misleading and certainly not very helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords there is considerable sympathy for what the noble lord is trying to achieve <e> <s> there is inconsistency in the face of the statute <e> <s> therefore it follows that the powers under section should be extended to cover all offences of poaching and unlawful killing under part iii of the act <e> <s> the drafting of the noble lords amendment is not altogether happy and i do not think he intends to press it tonight <e> <s> therefore i am not going to weary him with all the details <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it would be for the convenience of the house and more especially for those who hearken to our debates if i say something about what has troubled the house and indeed me <e> <s> i have throughout the second reading and committee stages taken note of the very widespread concern which has been expressed about the standards and methods of control exercised over deer in forests especially those owned by the forestry commission <e> <s> my noble friend lord dulverton wrote to me at length and indeed most helpfully on the subject and of course i shall reply to his letter in due course but i think it is right that i should say what i am going to say at this juncture <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been asked a number of questions <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross expressed a cautious welcome to this order if that is the right way to describe his reaction <e> <s> of course his first complaint was that there is no revaluation of domestic subjects and therefore there are no ways so he says of putting right the various bones of contention if i may so describe them which have undoubtedly exercised a lot of people in and around the area of troon <e> <s> what i say about that is that the assessor is always allowed to take account of decisions which the land valuation appeal court may make <e> <s> equally a ratepayer is perfectly entitled to appeal as many have done <e> <s> and if their appeals are successful then as i have said the assessor may take whatever is the result into account in future assessments <e> <s> the next matter was the timing of all this <e> <s> this was a point which <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is making assumptions which i do not think are warranted <e> <s> the procedures which the act lays down give a very wide discretion to my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e> <s> if things were going to stay as they are then i quite agree with the noble lord that we should have to wait for a period of review but what i am about to go on to tell him is that things are not going to stay as they are so far as domestic ratepayers are concerned which is why they have been excluded from this revaluation <e> <s> the noble lord said that having read and taken account of both the green paper and the layfield report nothing could happen until the s <e> <s> if the noble lord had taken account of these documents he would know that while i agree that if a system of local income tax is imposed so far as domestic ratepayers are concerned there will be a very long gearing-in process it may well be that a solution which is less radical than a local income tax will be suggested <e> <s> in that situation it would take a very much shorter period of time to implement than a local income tax <e>", "<cs> i can tell the noble lord that they are not nearly finished in my part of the world <e> <s> if an appeal is successful then assessors may amend the roll in the light of the relevant court decision <e>", "<cs> they may <e> <s> they do not have to <e> <s> it is really a false point to say that because domestic ratepayers are excluded from this revaluation there is some kind of unfairness which cannot be put right until the next revaluation takes place <e> <s> that i reject <e>", "<cs> yes that is so <e> <s> there is no reason to disturb the domestic sector <e> <s> as i have tried to say those who are dissatisfied with the last revaluation are already appealing <e> <s> there is no reason to disturb them <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can answer the noble and learned lords question shortly <e> <s> yes i take his point <e> <s> what i believe he is saying is when one comes to redetermine rights of appeal so far as domestic ratepayers are concerned if in effect we disturb the quinquennium which is what we are doing then we ought to consider as it were rights of appeal on the part of domestic rate-payers who are otherwise stopped from complaining <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to say a <e>", "<cs> my lords no doubt this is a theme which the noble lord lord davies of leek can develop if he has put his name down to speak and indeed if he has not <e> <s> but perhaps i might continue with the latter parts of the bill <e> <s> the most important elements are those concerning safety in part iv <e> <s> this part provides for important amendments to existing legislation <e> <s> i would like to review briefly how we see the aims and objectives of the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has asked me three rhetorical questions and i do not think they really should be rhetorical <e> <s> it is not my practice to interrupt noble lords speeches but i think i must on this occasion <e> <s> the reserves of energy which we have on the united kingdom continental shelf are proving and in the future will continue to prove of the most vital interest to this country and its economic recovery <e> <s> it would be a shame if they were prevented from being exploited to the full by the out-of-date nostrums of the party opposite and a belief in economic theories which have been exploded years and years ago <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord bishopston and indeed the noble lord lord tanlaw carried out a review of the bill which goes considerably further than the amendment <e> <s> i do not blame either of them for that because it is quite a good idea to get some of these matters out of the way for the consideration of the bill later on <e> <s> when the noble lord lord bishopston suggested that the bill might be withdrawn because of the state which obtains in the south atlantic i was a little troubled but luckily he caught my eye and he gave a great grin as he was saying it <e> <s> i realised that obviously he was meant to be taken seriously but not too seriously <e>", "<cs> i have great respect for the noble lord lord balogh <e> <s> i am sure that he will agree on reading through the bill that it has absolutely nothing to do with emergency powers <e> <s> the cleavage between this side of the committee and those opposite <e>", "<cs> i tried to say to the noble lord earlier that there is nothing sacred about the per cent <e> <s> to start with <e> <s> any director will naturally take part in the deliberations and affairs of the board in precisely the same way as any other director <e> <s> they are not going to be bound by some unspoken policy or indeed by a policy that is laid down <e> <s> i think that is the answer to his question <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether the noble lord lord beswick was in his place but at the beginning of my remarks i said that the government were quite convinced that this measure would enhance the interests of those who work in the corporation and i stand by that <e> <s> i do not see merely because the ownership of the shares or a proportion of them is transferred from the public sector to shareholders that the company is not given as we say every opportunity to expand to maximise its profits to pay the greatest salaries that it can and generally to have regard for the wellbeing and prosperity of its employees in exactly the same way as i have no doubt it will for its shareholders <e>", "<cs> the government see no reason to exclude bnocs th and th round licences which are part of its upstream business from the provisions of the bill for reasons that i shall come to in a few moments <e> <s> the governments intention is to retain participation trading wholly in the public sector under the experienced management of the corporations trading arm that is of course bnoc <e> <s> participation trading makes an important contribution to the security of our oil supplies and it is therefore entirely appropriate that it should remain a wholly public sector activity <e>", "<cs> yes of course i am pleased to do so <e> <s> the case for the government is that our supply arrangements will not be adversely affected by our plans to dispose of bnocs oil-producing business <e> <s> i say that for a variety of reasons <e> <s> first there is bnocs access under participation agreements to up to per cent <e> <s> of current north sea production <e> <s> as i have said participation oil makes an important contribution to united kingdom security and obviously we wish to see it continue <e> <s> it is for that reason that the trading arm of bnoc and the participation agreements will remain in the public sector under state control and these arrangements will not be affected by privatisation <e>", "<cs> with respect i do not think the noble lord has addressed himself to the point i am trying to make which is to answer the noble lord lord bishopston when he asked me about security of supply <e> <s> what i was trying to say was that in certain circumstances bnoc given time could redirect supplies if for some critical reason it was necessary to do so <e> <s> if i may go on it should also be remembered that <e>", "<cs> i think we must distinguish between the supply of oil and the participation agreements which will ensure as i have tried to say that it remains under public sector control <e> <s> this is the physical aspect of the matter <e> <s> the price at which the oil will be bought by bnoc is in no way going to change as a result of this bill <e> <s> its duty so to speak and its liabilities will not change at all <e> <s> the price of the shares in britoil is a matter to which the committee has not yet addressed itself <e> <s> this is an entirely different matter and has nothing to do with participation agreements and as i have said the actual supply of oil <e>", "<cs> i am well aware that at the moment oil is apparently in over-supply but the <e>", "<cs> i think that one must distinguish between the articles of association of the company which give the secretary of state very wide powers in the event of certain things happening and we shall come to that as the noble lord has indicated and will discuss those things in due course and these safeguards written into the articles and the question of participation agreements and the supply of oil under them which i think is rather a different matter <e> <s> what i have sought to do is to show the committee that as far as rounds to are concerned there will be no difference as far as bnocs participation oil is concerned that is to say the participation agreements will be totally unaffected <e>", "<cs> to that i say pretty well what i have said before that all this will happen before britoil is floated off and therefore there will be adequate time to look at the participation agreement between bnoc and britoil and to take any action which commends itself to the noble lord or to anybody else <e>", "<cs> this is another amendment which seeks to put a fetter on the way in which the shares of britoil are sold <e> <s> the noble lord lord bishopston in the first breath when he came to move the amendment talked about the sale of licences <e> <s> i am sure that that was a slip of the tongue <e> <s> what we are talking about is the sale of shares effectively in britoil once it is floated off <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord wynne-jones said that he was going to ask me a question <e> <s> eventually it seemed to come down to where in the <e>", "<cs> methinks that the noble lord doth protest too much <e> <s> the bill did not go into the scottish standing committee in another place and the noble lord knows that as well as i do <e> <s> as i have tried to say we have to distinguish between the shares and the oil which is produced and which will be produced in the future <e> <s> what i have tried to do is to show the formidable battery of means which the secretary of state for energy has at his disposal to see to it that nothing untoward happens so far as the disposal of shares in britoil and the future policy of the board thereafter are concerned <e> <s> he has certain reserve powers if there should be a takeover bid or a bid for a block of shares which he thinks should be investigated and possibly blocked in the public interest <e> <s> that is something which is contained in the articles of association and no doubt we shall come to it in considerable detail <e>", "<cs> the noble lord implied it <e> <s> the sale of shares will proceed in an orderly manner and the amount of money raised will be consistent with the value of the assets which in effect are being sold <e> <s> that is one reason why the committee may agree that this method which has been adopted by the government in respect of privatisation of this part of the public sector is one which will achieve just that <e>", "<cs> may i deal first with the <e>", "<cs> we shall come to it but clause does not apply to this particular clause of the bill <e>", "<cs> this is a technical phrase to mean a piece of paper upon which the secretary of state has signified his consent in writing <e>", "<cs> i think not because clause stands on its own <e> <s> as i tried to say it is not the means by which we shall dispose of the shares in britoil once they are floated off <e> <s> that is what i have been trying to say to the committee that the amendment which has been proposed by the noble lord lord bishopston would not achieve what he seeks to achieve or at least i think what he seeks to achieve particularly when he uses amersham international to illustrate the point he is making that there should have been greater control over the shares of that company <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord bishopston moved both of these amendments nos <e> <s> and together which is probably helpful from the time point of view but he does i know appreciate that the two amendments do relate to two rather different subjects <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> relates to the valuation of the shares and to the role if there is to be one of the comptroller and auditor general and the submission of his report to parliament <e> <s> those are three distinct issues <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> deals with what i might call the spread of ownership of shares <e> <s> that raises rather different considerations so i shall have to deal with both amendments together <e> <s> i hope that the committee will bear with me although i get the impression that these are in the nature of probing amendments which seek to make plain the attitude of the government so far as it has not been made plain up till now <e>", "<cs> the trouble is and it has frequently become apparent with employee share arrangements that if the employees and small shareholders see the opportunity of a quick profit they are more concerned to take it than to wait for the long-term advantages which will accrue if they hang on to the shares <e> <s> that is human nature and not the fault of the system if i may say so <e> <s> if small shareholders avail themselves of the shares and they are at a fair price and the shares subsequently appreciate i am afraid nothing that any of us can do will compel them to retain their shares if they happen to want to realise their capital gain and have some useful purpose to which to devote the money <e> <s> obviously as i have said we want to pay particular heed to the interests of small shareholders and above all to give them the opportunity to acquire shares in britoil <e>", "<cs> there is no doubt that lord tanlaws amendment has prompted an interesting debate which came to a fiery conclusion up until now at any rate with the noble lord lord wynne-jones <e> <s> may i just say that the government are not saying anything except that they wish to put britoil on exactly the same footing as any other company in the private sector <e> <s> the matters which have been raised by this amendment go very wide indeed <e> <s> we get to all sorts of questions to which the last government addressed themselves <e> <s> the european parliament when i was in it if i may reminisce on a personal basis for a little for over two years in the legal affairs committee addressed themselves to this question and they have never come to any conclusion at all <e> <s> the difficulties of definition apart from anything else what is and what is not an employee are quite bad enough without trying to legislate for representation <e>", "<cs> share schemes which are not the subject of this amendment are coming more and more into private industry and of course the government have given their blessing to that <e> <s> what i am talking about is what on the continent is referred to as worker directors <e> <s> i am saying that it is inappropriate for such a framework to be imposed on britoil at its inception <e>", "<cs> i fully accept that but it is quite a different consideration from what is being suggested in the amendment <e> <s> i do not see anything inconsistent between what i have been saying and what the noble lord is saying <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord mottistone for coming to my aid though i scarcely think that was necessary <e> <s> the noble lord <e>", "<cs> there is no question of the government refusing to allow anything to be discussed <e> <s> i am saying it is undesirable in the context of the bill to impose that sort of framework by statute <e> <s> there is absolutely nothing to stop the company if it so wishes from taking a course parallel with or similar to that which is promoted by the noble lord lord tanlaw <e> <s> i am saying it is inappropriate in a bill such as this to try to impose something which is difficult and complex on a company such as britoil <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord bishopston is going very wide of the amendment <e>", "<cs> share schemes are catered for in clause and that is quite different from imposing on the company a framework of worker directors or employee representative directors <e>", "<cs> i was waiting for some justification from noble lords opposite for this amendment but there has been none <e> <s> what the amendment seeks to do is to prevent bnoc from disposing of britoil shares to members of its board or to companies in which bnoc board members are involved as directors <e> <s> the committee will know since i have said it already on more than one occasion that it is going to be the government who will carry out the sale of the shares <e> <s> i take the noble lords point to the extent that what he seeks to achieve as i understand it is to prevent members of the board of britoil from owning shares in the company particularly under an employees pay scheme <e>", "<cs> either i am being denser than usual or the noble lords mind is not running with the amendment <e> <s> what i thought we were discussing was the sale of shares in britoil to directors of what at the moment is bnoc which has really nothing to do with large corporations or multi-national share ownership or anything else <e> <s> it concerns the desirability or otherwise of directors in effect being allowed to buy shares in the flotation of britoil <e> <s> what i have sought <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> obviously one must take seriously any concern which any member of the committee expresses <e> <s> what we are talking about is individual directors of bnoc being given a chance to buy a few shares because i do not suppose they can afford more than a few in what is going to be the privatised britoil <e> <s> it is a matter for their own judgment as to whether they should seek to subscribe for shares <e> <s> we are not talking about cornering the market or some unjust or some undue advantage being taken of an individuals position <e> <s> therefore i am saying that an individual should be treated like any other director of a company which is to have a flotation <e>", "<cs> this amendment falls into two parts <e> <s> the first part of this amendment would require the government to seek independent advice before pricing the shares in britoil <e> <s> the government are very much aware of the need to have such advice and an independent firm of consulting petroleum engineers energy resource consultants are already preparing a study of britoils oil assets <e> <s> this study will be available to the government and their advisers in pricing the shares and a summary of it will be published in the prospectus <e> <s> the government are also receiving advice from s g warburg and company limited on the offer and we will be consulting them on the price <e> <s> i hope that the committee will agree with me that there is no doubt about the governments intention to obtain proper professional advice in connection with the offer for sale <e> <s> i do not believe that there really is any requirement to write this into the bill <e>", "<cs> ever eager in his lust for pursuit the noble lord lord beswick has anticipated my remarks <e> <s> he himself said that he hoped the offer would not be as it were subject to the parliamentary timetable which of course it would be if this amendment was accepted <e> <s> so perhaps i can develop my remarks and i promise the noble lord that i will come to his particular point of concern <e>", "<cs> i would have thought that that was implicit in my argument <e> <s> i have not taken the point which is implied in the noble lords amendment that it is not going to be bnoc that sells these shares to the public it is going to be the secretary of state <e> <s> i do not believe in taking technical points of this nature so far as this type of amendment is concerned <e> <s> but it is going to be the secretary of state who is going to be responsible for the sale of these shares both at the original flotation and on any subsequent occasion <e>", "<cs> i suppose it was inevitable that on this the first amendment dealing with part ii of the bill we should go back to principles and matters which certainly were ventilated at very considerable length on second reading <e> <s> nevertheless there are those who did not have the opportunity of explaining how they felt about this bill to your lordships <e> <s> i dare say that by having the debate now we can perhaps at least save a lengthy debate on clause stand part which might have been more appropriate <e>", "<cs> my noble friend seems to forget that there appear to be armies of trained gas fitters about now <e> <s> presumably the appliances will need to be installed and maintained thereafter and i can see no reason why the trained fitters who at present exist should not perform that task and in the same way as electricians are trained so will future gas fitters be trained <e>", "<cs> i did not say the government would maintain consumer contact points but that they would encourage the corporation to maintain them <e> <s> frankly one does not need a highly expensive showroom in the middle of a city centre to collect peoples cash for gas bills and provide advice to would-be customers <e> <s> i foresee the gas corporation making local arrangements according to patterns of population and the consumption of gas which most commends itself to the corporation in any particular locality <e>", "<cs> when i said the safety of consumers was paramount it was in the context of that part of the argument to which i was addressing myself <e> <s> i first went into what i might call the second reading part of the argument then i went on to the question of safety of supplies which as i said is dealt with in clause that has nothing to do with showrooms and the provision of retail appliances on sale and then i returned to the amendment <e> <s> if the noble lord looks at clause he will see that it is peculiarly inappropriate that an enjoinment dare i say a meaningless enjoinment <e> <s> should be tacked on to a provision dealing with the shares of a relevant subsidiary <e> <s> as i said it would be inappropriate <e> <s> the government must bring in legislation before there is any disposal of this part of the corporations activity and i am sure the noble lord agrees that it is undesirable to write unnecessary provisions into a statute in any circumstances particularly if as i said that provision is vague in its application <e>", "<cs> i am sure the opposition quite understandably rejoice at such crumbs of victory as fall their way and i have no wish to spoil the noble baronesss fun but at a private and convenient place outside this chamber she may like to explain to me what this amendment meant and what its effect will be in <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord beswick comes back to the central question which he has asked on a number of occasions what is the point of this bill <e> <s> i see that i said on second reading that the sale of the corporations offshore assets will put them in the hands of the private sector where they will be used to better effect <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me one is perfectly able to listen to the noble lords tautologous points and also confer with colleagues at the same time <e>", "<cs> the noble lord with great courtesy merely puts a point which if i may say so he has been making at quarter-hourly intervals throughout the consideration of this bill <e> <s> but to answer his point if in the future taking this bill as it stands and with no privatisation of the gas the gas corporation discovers an oilfield it would be privatised the gas would be bought by the gas corporation in the way in which it will buy gas in the future by offering for it <e> <s> if i may say so i do not think the matter is quite so simplistic as the noble lord infers <e> <s> the gas corporation will not be inhibited in its future exploration by these forms of considerations <e>", "<cs> do not let there be any doubt about this what i have said is that as it stands at present the government have no intention of privatising the british gas corporation so far as its pure gas interests are concerned <e>", "<cs> may i say that i am not in any state of muddle at all <e> <s> i do not want to be unkind to my noble friend but i had hoped that the noble lord lord bishopston having reflected on my recent words of wisdom would not think that they needed to be embroidered any further <e> <s> but of course i shall be very happy to do so <e>", "<cs> this is a matter which exercised another place at some length <e> <s> i say that only because i had rather expected the noble lord lord strabolgi to say that the government undertook to review the matter <e> <s> he might have asked what had been the result of that review because my honourable friend mr mellor at column of the <e>", "<cs> this amendment would remove the clarification that ensures that a scheme transferring assets from bgc or a wholly-owned subsidiary to a relevant subsidiary can include supplementary provisions relating to the interpretation of licences agreements and other documents <e> <s> perhaps i should explain the purpose and why these words appear in the bill <e>", "<cs> rights in this case undoubtedly include patent rights or any other form of right but of course as between the transferor and the transferee <e> <s> so broadly speaking what the secretary of state would want to achieve in such an eventuality is that the third party would be left in a neutral position so far as the transferor or transferee was concerned <e> <s> i hope that satisfied the noble lord <e>", "<cs> perhaps i will shorten the labours of the house by saying that i will communicate with the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran so far as any broadening or amplification of what i have said may be necessary <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble <e>", "<cs> the easy answer is to say that <e>", "<cs> i am very much obliged for that last intervention <e> <s> i thought that i had covered the points which the noble lord lord tanlaw had raised <e> <s> the intention is that the gas corporation in the future will be treated exactly the same as any other nationalised industry <e> <s> therefore its financial regime will not be changed by virtue of the selling off of part of these assets <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord bruce correctly said clause to which we shall come provides that orders made under clause shall be made a statutory instrument subject to the negative resolution procedure and that will provide for a proper degree of parliamentary scrutiny by both <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> certainly the transfer to the secretary of state is subject to the negative procedure <e> <s> with regard to the eventual disposal by the secretary of state i shall consider the point and we can always return to it at a later stage of the bill if necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend is being advised on the effects of the deliberations of the committee <e> <s> there is no doubt about it but that the summary of the report of the committee which has been placed in both libraries of the houses of parliament has attracted a lot of attention <e> <s> the effect of my right honourable friends deliberations will be that the more sensible options will be continued and the more useful forms of research and development will be continued and possibly enhanced <e> <s> those which appear to be less useful will be curtailed <e>", "<cs> my lords the total amount which is to be spent on renewables is in the region of million to million <e> <s> that figure compares with million spent in <e> <s> i am afraid that i have no further information as to the actual figures of costs <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the first part of my noble friends supplementary question is concerned i can confirm that wave power is regarded as being a less useful form of research but i have no information as to the actual costs <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the concern felt by the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos and by the house as to the severn barrage <e> <s> i can tell the noble lord that the advisory council acord has nothing to do with the severn barrage <e> <s> the consideration which my right honourable friend is giving to the bondi report is quite separate and apart and this decision has absolutely nothing to do with that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not have that information but if i can obtain it i will write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have been giving almost unceasing attention to the problems which have been thrown up if that is the phrase by the closure of corpach pulp mills and the smelter at invergordon <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland has been giving this matter close personal attention and i know that my noble friend will realise that there are hopeful signs <e> <s> having said that i must tell my noble friend that his supplementary question goes quite beyond the scope of the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so the cuts are modest naturally one would prefer none but this is a matter of general government policy <e> <s> i can tell the house that very considerable expenditure as i have said is continuing to be incurred on renewable energy and a number of quite exciting research projects of very different types are continuing to take place <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down it would help me if he would indicate whether in fact he was speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and because he seemed to be verging on doing so and i want to know whether to refer to those amendments in my own remarks <e>", "<cs> when we disentangle the rhetoric and the hyperbole from the argument this amendment comes down to the fact that the noble lord lord lovell-davis is seeking to turn what i might call the negative procedure into an affirmative procedure <e> <s> so there is no question about giving any more powers to the secretary of state or indeed of fettering the powers of the secretary of state <e> <s> all this amendment seeks to do is to impose a different form of parliamentary scrutiny upon the bill <e>", "<cs> i will deal with one interruption at a time if i may <e> <s> i am always ready to listen to lectures from the noble lord lord tanlaw <e> <s> i have not mentioned anyones manifesto or undertakings of that nature neither do i intend to refer to any noble lord particularly without giving him notice nor will make any false points <e> <s> no doubt the committee will listen to what i have to say and judge it accordingly <e> <s> now of course i give way to the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside <e>", "<cs> let us both read <e>", "<cs> i take issue with the word dissipation they are examples of executive action <e>", "<cs> i hope i am as honest at this dispatch box as in the other place <e> <s> of course i will give the matter more thought but it is a matter of considerable importance and it really would be dishonest if i held out much hope to the noble lord lord bishopston <e> <s> i hope i have shown that what the noble lord lord lovell-davis seeks to do i am presently so advised and am of that opinion would not be very sensible <e>", "<cs> my lords the general assembly is due to debate this report tomorrow and i hesitate to pre-empt its deliberation <e> <s> however what i can say to my noble friend is that many representatives of foreign companies which have set up in scotland have expressed their satisfaction at scottish workers competence and adaptability to change and as witness of that we have the example of the development of the electronics industry in scotland and the highly successful oil-related industry up the eastern seaboard <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it is worthy of note that the committee has in fact paid tribute to the scottish office for its contribution to the development and the fostering of national pride and for its securing the development of all things scottish <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend will appreciate that the proposals which have been put forward are roughly speaking on a two-pronged basis first the reconstitution of the district boards into area boards or something like and secondly the raising of new finance in order that they can carry out their responsibilities <e> <s> i regret to tell the house that on both those fronts there has been very little agreement as between the boards themselves and more importantly the very varied interests which comprise the anglers in scotland <e> <s> doing the best that i can i am trying to reconcile these conflicting interests and i am very well aware that the atlantic salmon if not an endangered species is coming under threat <e> <s> but if we are to legislate it must be on a basis of consensus <e>", "<cs> my lords the faroes fishery which grew rapidly in and is now limited by agreement between the community and faroe to tonnes in and tonnes in <e> <s> it is gratifying that faroe has been persuaded to reduce its catch from the very high levels which were previously proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords the primary aim of the governments economic strategy is to reduce inflation and thus to create the climate in which industry can prosper and unemployment can be reduced <e> <s> for the first time in three years we have single-figure inflation <e> <s> interest rates too have come down from last years levels <e> <s> the availability of assistance from the highlands and islands development board has helped greatly to mitigate the effects of the current recession in the highlands and islands <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may deal first with the latter point of my noble friends supplementary question i would say that the percentage increases in whisky excise in the last budget were in line with those on other spirits such as gin and vodka but were half those on wine petrol and beer <e> <s> the reason i say that is that the government are very well aware of the difficulties which the whisky industry has recently been facing <e> <s> i am also aware of the <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord shinwell is suggesting himself as part of some sort of promotion of the benefits of drinking whisky i am sure the industry and certainly the house would accept such with acclamation <e> <s> more seriously whisky is a fluid which delights the hearts of men and on the basis of a little of what you fancy does you good i am sure it will go from strength to strength <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the noble lord was listening or indeed whether he understood a previous answer i gave but the fact of the matter is that whisky was treated if that is the word with a certain compassion if again that is the word in relation to the last budget increase <e> <s> as i have tried to explain my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer is well aware of the difficulties which have been facing the whisky industry and as i have said these measures were taken in a way that bore these difficulties in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords any scot or indeed all scots will know of the tremendous increase in the availability and indeed the strength of malt whiskies recently in the last few years <e> <s> my answer to the noble lord lord shinwell was not entirely with my tongue in my cheek <e> <s> for those of us who really do enjoy a nip of malt whisky during an evening and are able to afford it certainly the range on offer has increased enormously in the last few years <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not those figures available <e> <s> if i may i will make inquiries and write to the noble viscount <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i entirely agree with the noble lord <e> <s> the highlands board has done and is continuing to do an extremely good job <e> <s> one way in which its success is reflected is that in fact unemployment in the highlands and islands is running at a slightly lower figure than that for scotland as a whole <e> <s> i am not complacent but it does point to the success of the board <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i agree with the noble lords contention <e> <s> obviously alcohol taken in excess causes grave problems not least to those who actually have to deal with and are part of the family of those who over-indulge <e> <s> nevertheless the benefits of whisky at least both in terms of moderate drinking and to those who gain their living from the manufacture and distribution of it are of the greatest benefit to scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> this is the second major bill affecting local government in scotland to come before your lordships house this session <e> <s> in content the present bill represents a sharp contrast with the civic government scotland bill <e> <s> this legislation is less concerned with the relationships between local government and the individual and much more concerned with general questions of local authority functions and the way they are divided between the two principal tiers of local government <e> <s> part i of the bill also deals with the relationship between local government and the secretary of state on financial matters <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank all noble lords who have taken part in this debate which predictably has ranged fairly widely <e> <s> the first thing i ought to say before the noble lord lord ross has to depart and i may say that he was courteous enough to send me a note saying that he has come under pressure concerns the timing of this debate <e> <s> of course it would be very nice if the second reading had occurred early immediately after starred questions <e> <s> but the combination of animals and sex as the noble lord quite rightly observed is absolutely irresistible to the english and therefore we have been unfortunately relegated to the mid-afternoon <e> <s> all i will say to the noble lord is that if one took this as being a normal thursday and not the last day of term as it were then we would be <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that <e> <s> what i intended to imply was compensation in the sense of a readjustment as between one payer and another compensation for unfairness not compensation in cash terms <e> <s> i hope that that now makes it plain <e> <s> it may not be satisfactory to the noble lord but i hope that at least it is plain <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords as i think the noble lord lord bruce of donington indicated what his amendment seeks to do is to introduce another layer of parliamentary procedure before the secretary of state could give his consent to bnoc disposing of shares in britoil <e> <s> i am as anxious as any noble lord to see a proper level of parliamentary accountability established for the disposal of britoil but i really cannot accept that the proposed additional order is necessary and i think that in the terms expressed in the amendment in fact it would be wrong to accede to such an order <e>", "<cs> my lords i assume that the noble lord was asking me something before i sat down <e> <s> if i may disregard the second reading part of his remarks this amendment deals with a flotation of shares and whether or not there is to be an extra layer of parliamentary scrutiny before the shares arc eventually floated off <e> <s> with respect that is the question to which the house must address itself <e>", "<cs> my lords we had an interesting debate on the articles of britoil at some of the earlier sessions on the bill <e> <s> it was a well-informed debate <e> <s> noble lords obviously had looked at the articles as had the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> the articles have been available since early march <e> <s> therefore i must say that i was slightly surprised to see this particular amendment put down in the way that it was in effect to make it a condition of the secretary of states consent to a disposal of shares by bnoc that the articles should be submitted to parliament <e> <s> i should have said that we had already fulfilled that condition <e> <s> if it is the submission of the noble lord as i think it is that when he used the words submit to parliament he means that parliament should nit-pick over all the articles in the way that the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe who i am sorry to see is not in his place would deprecate then i adopt the same view as lord taylor <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> ensures that the corporation has for the purpose of facilitating a disposal the power to increase the capital of subsidiaries in addition to the power it already has to establish subsidiaries <e> <s> this will enable bnoc which has already established britoil as a company to increase britoils share capital prior to its transfer to the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may deal first with the noble lord lord lloyd of hampstead i am very surprised that <e>", "<cs> my lords all i can say to the noble lord is that jolly good peers have come out of hampstead before now <e> <s> so i was not intending in any way to insult him <e> <s> it was only my confusion because i remember approving <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i do not think we need worry about the nomenclature of peers any longer <e> <s> i was confused because i approved a letter and my noble and learned friend confirmed that he had a hand in it from his eyrie where he dispenses legal advice <e> <s> the letter went to the noble lord addressed to the house of lords and i for one do not know why he has not got it <e> <s> that is why i was covered with confusion and i am very sorry <e>", "<cs> my lords my better judgment told me that i should not have tried to shorten our labours <e> <s> my less good judgment told me that in his practice the noble lord lord bruce of donington would know what i was talking about and that i would not have to do it <e> <s> but now i am going to have to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i have the right to speak again because it is my motion <e> <s> so far as the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran is concerned i can save myself writing a letter the drafting has been carried out with the european community in mind and we have not identified any problems so far as the drafting of this provision of the bill is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords of course when the noble and learned lord asks me to look at this i will undertake to do so but he will appreciate that i do so without any firm commitment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to pry into the correspondence of the noble baroness but i wonder whether we are looking at the same letter <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no secret it is dated th june <e>", "<cs> my lords with due regard to the noble lord i think i shall make my speech and answer his points in that way because it probably will be shorter in the end <e> <s> the government have been accused of being totally obdurate so far as this bill is concerned and unwilling to compromise in any way shape or form but it is obvious that there has been a genuine and sustained attempt at compromise and that there is a successful measure of compromise put together not least through the efforts of my noble friend lady macleod <e> <s> before condemning those efforts noble lords opposite might have given them a little consideration <e> <s> however that is not to be <e>", "<cs> my lords it may help if i speak first of all to the amendment to the amendment moved by the noble baroness lady fisher <e> <s> i said originally that the wording which has been adopted in this amendment and which closely followed the latter part of the old amendment no <e> <s> a in effect if not in actual drafting whatever the intention was vague in concept of standard of service and supply and the government simply cannot accept an amendment drafted in that form <e>", "<cs> my lords that is so <e>", "<cs> my lords i was trying to scratch around if that is the phrase to find bits of the bill which could possibly as it were embrace the imprecise words but nevertheless genuine intention of the noble lord <e> <s> it seems that i have not altogether succeeded i shall try harder <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the effect of the noble lords amendment would be to provide that upon a disposal of assets the gas corporation shall have first call on the proceeds for an amount representing not only the costs of disposal and any residual tax liabilities but also the net book value of the assets disposed of <e> <s> i think that that is what the amendment amounts to <e> <s> as the noble lord said we discussed this in the context of amendments nos <e> <s> and in committee and the general point remains that the government cannot accept a general requirement that the corporation retains the net hook value of assets disposed of because that would in effect reduce the flow of funds to the exchequer <e> <s> there is no reason why the british gas corporation should retain a constant volume of resources when the effect of disposal would be to reduce the scope of the corporations activities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not entitled to speak again and i think that i have already covered the point as to liability in the way that the corporation can argue the case on a case-by-case basis <e> <s> therefore i am afraid that i cannot help the house any further <e>", "<cs> my lords these two amendments bring us back again to the question of parliamentary accountability <e> <s> that is a subject which we have already debated in very considerable detail <e> <s> it was quite naturally mentioned on second reading <e> <s> it was discussed at length on all three days which we spent in committee and we discussed it in relation to clauses and as well as clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know the noble lord was reading part of his speech and do not know whether he was reading that bit <e> <s> but i shall certainly look at <e>", "<cs> my lords as noble lords have said these amendments relate to the duty of the bnoc and the british gas corporation to comply with directions given to them under parts i and ii of the bill respectively and i will deal with each of the corporations in turn <e> <s> i want to say this by way of preface and i say it with i hope the proper respect which the noble and learned lord deserves that directions under clause can be given only in certain circumstances in other words to the oil corporation under a provision of part i and to the gas corporation under any provision of part ii <e> <s> therefore the directions which may be given are much more restricted in scope than might at first blush seem to be the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to traverse all the paths we encountered in the last amendment <e> <s> i have to tell the house that although the wording of this particular amendment is rather different from amendment no <e> <s> none of the considerations to which i invited the house to have regard are in any way different from this amendment as they are from the other <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords amendment seeks to amend an amendment to schedule to the gas act <e> <s> the parent clause if i may so describe it is clause <e> <s> therefore we have debated this principle already very extensively and the way in which the power is to be used <e> <s> paragraph b of schedule deals with section of the gas act and section taken with paragraph a empowers the secretary of state to direct the gas corporation to discontinue or restrict activities or to call in loans <e> <s> paragraph b deletes from section the proviso that the secretary of state shall not give directions unless satisfied that he will not thereby impede or prevent the proper discharge of the corporations duties and substitutes an obligation on bgc to comply with directions notwithstanding statutory duties <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord is making the same mistake as his noble friend lord mishcon <e> <s> this is not intended <e> <s> in fact it does not give the secretary of state power in effect in a svengali-like manner to direct the gas corporation to behave in a way which is one might say against the law <e> <s> in other words in exactly the same way as i tried to explain to the noble lord lord mishcon that the secretary of state could not direct for instance bnoc to enter into some kind of flotation which would disregard sections of the companies act so the secretary of state could not under this power compel <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems that peace is breaking out all over the chamber <e> <s> since the last stage of this bill we have reconsidered paragraphs to of schedule both in themselves but more especially in relation to other provisions of the bill <e> <s> there is a precedent for these provisions in the british telecommunications act <e> <s> in the particular case of the gas industry there is a feeling that it would be at least premature to contemplate at this stage a reduction in the remit of the gas consumers council <e> <s> in committee my noble friend paid tribute to the work of the consumers councils and we accept that this work should continue on its present basis as a useful part of the system of checks and balances which will safeguard the interests of consumers after this bill becomes law as indeed is the case at present <e> <s> so in inviting the house to agree to my noble friends amendment i should thank her for putting it down and for speaking to it in the way in which she has done <e>", "<cs> my lords i must thank the noble lord for the manner in which he began his remarks as regards this amendment <e> <s> i have gone over my notes so that i could see exactly what i said in relation to the last amendment including one or two matters which for the sake of brevity i excised <e> <s> i really do not think that i can improve on what i said previously in the sense that one cannot in fact prove a negative <e> <s> in those circumstances i do not wish in any way to make the house still less the noble lord feel that i am not anxious to assist but i do think that i answered the debate on the first amendment as fully as i could he expected to do and the arguments which i deployed on that occasion really do meet the case which the noble lord has put forward with his usual charm <e> <s> i am afraid that i have nothing further to say <e>", "<cs> my lords with this amendment we return to a point which was fully discussed on report and it is obvious that the explanations which i gave to noble lords opposite on that occasion were not received with favour <e> <s> nevertheless i shall not go fully down all the avenues which were explored last time <e> <s> i have said and i have said consistently that the amendment is unsatisfactory both in the way in which it has been drafted and in the effects that it could have <e> <s> it does not get any better by merely repeating time and again as the noble lord lord underhill has sought to do ably assisted by the noble baroness lady fisher that it is a good amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords at an earlier stage in the course of the bill the noble lord lord mishcon asked me a number of technical questions on the memorandum and articles of association of britoil which are in existence and are there to be read <e> <s> rightly or wrongly and partly owing to their technical nature i did not at that stage answer and nor have i since answered the noble lords questions <e> <s> now the noble lord asks me questions on memorandum and articles of association which do not exist and therefore i ask myself whether i would be well advised on this occasion to answer his questions bearing in mind that on the last occasion i did not <e> <s> it would be very foolish to try to peer so far into the future in respect of what may happen in relation to part ii of this bill relating to gas and try and foresee what might be within the memorandum and articles of association of a firm and try to say what they might mean <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not the first time that clause has occupied the attention of the house <e> <s> i am sorry that there still seems to be considerable uncertainty as to the meaning of this clause <e> <s> obviously there is that uncertainty or we should not be having yet another debate in this form <e> <s> i hope that i can once more put the clause into perspective and correct any misapprehensions there may be and also say why we find this amendment unacceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e> <s> i am not going to inflict a long speech upon the house at this stage because the matter has been considered at very considerable length by your lordships <e> <s> when i moved the second reading i described it as a major piece of legislation and that indeed is what it is <e> <s> we have had many debates and they have been thorough <e> <s> i do not complain of that at all particularly because the deliberations of the other place so far as this bill is concerned were truncated <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord hughes for the felicitous way in which he has decided to marshal his arguments on clauses and and for the brevity with which he spoke to your lordships committee <e> <s> we come right back to the central point of principle which we debated at considerable length in the local government miscellaneous provisions scotland act <e> <s> that is what is the subject of debate here whether those powers are justified and if they are whether they reduce if at all the function of local authorities and those councillors who are their elected representatives to some kind of mere cipher <e> <s> i have to disagree with the noble earl lord minto that by taking powers as we have to prevent the expenditure of money on a scale which was closely becoming outrageous and in a way which could prejudice the economic recovery of this country we are in some way negating local democracy and the function of local councillors <e> <s> i shall return to that point <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may respond to the noble lord <e> <s> even the most cursory inspection of the <e>", "<cs> it is i think convenient that i should follow my noble friend lady elliot and speak to my amendment which is amendment no <e> <s> at the same time as i speak to her amendment <e> <s> this matter was raised during the committee stage in another place and an amendment was withdrawn following an assurance by my honourable friend the minister for home affairs and the environment that the matter was under active consideration <e>", "<cs> this amendment reflects similar amendments as the noble lord has quite fairly said which were made in this house to the corresponding english provision in the local government miscellaneous provisions bill and it was indeed section of the local government act <e> <s> the effect would be to make absolutely clear that section can be used by local authorities to assist financially persons carrying on industrial and commercial undertakings and secondly to clarify whether expenditure under this provision which is of course limited to the product of a rate of p in the pound is to be regarded as net or gross <e>", "<cs> clause concentrates local authority responsibility for all the activities in section of the act on district councils and island councils <e> <s> regional councils are specifically enabled under clause to contribute towards expenses incurred by districts or islands or by area tourist organisations in their undertaking any of the functions under section so that the provision would enable a regional council to make a financial contribution or for example to provide premises free of charge for use by a district or island authority or other body engaged in an activity specified in section as amended by this bill <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has correctly said clause describes the role we envisage for regional councils and gives prominence to the powers of regional councils in future to contribute to expenses incurred by others in providing or maintaining leisure and recreational facilities or in providing or promoting leisure activities <e> <s> the clause as it now stands is not restricted by the stodart recommendation that regions should be limited to a power to contribute only where the catchment area for a facility was wider than the district involved <e> <s> very strong concern was expressed in another place that regions should not be inhibited from contributing to activities in the leisure field in this way and the clause therefore gives regions a freestanding power to contribute by grant towards expenses incurred by districts or by grant or loan towards expenses incurred by other bodies <e> <s> it is also made clear that the power extends to contributions to the arts <e>", "<cs> it is slightly surprising that in a bill of this nature which is a major bill full of highly important and in some cases complicated and intricate clauses the most spirited debate we have had arguably at any rate concerns this matter of food and drugs <e> <s> this amendment concerns the reasonably modest proposal in clause which could hardly be described as making a major change in the law <e> <s> formidable is the adjective which has been used most frequently and the one thing that i would say which has been formidable is the amount of time and energy which quite obviously outside bodies have used to put forward their views to as many noble lords as possible <e> <s> like all pressure groups they tend not to overstate their case if i may use a pregnant negative and there have been a few misconceptions and possibly exaggerations which have grown up in this matter <e> <s> perhaps i may try to dispel them <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord hughes has really answered his own question <e> <s> although he will appreciate this is a point on which i cannot give a definitive answer at this moment there are many parts of the bill where the functions and therefore the financial responsibility of the local authority have changed <e> <s> although the government have made commitments to review the financial arrangements in the light of these changes of function and financial responsibility the totality of spending will be in no way affected <e> <s> this is what i consider would be the case in respect of this amendment and as the noble lord said of the next amendment also <e> <s> if i am wrong about that but i do not think i am i will hastily get in touch with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord is being rather simplistic if i may say so <e> <s> what this clause does is to give local authorities the power to make loans at a higher rate <e> <s> in due course the loans will have to be repaid <e> <s> any expenditure which the local authority undertakes in carrying out this power will be reckonable for rate support purposes <e> <s> the totality of the matter comes into the fact that local authorities are increasing their expenditure every year and the government under the powers which parliament has given to them have to do their best to see that those increases are reasonable in the general economic climate appertaining at any one time <e> <s> i cannot help the noble lord very much further <e> <s> the amendment is at the request of local authorities and like so many other features of local government it will mean that they will have to adjust their priorities accordingly but that is no reason for not giving them the power <e>", "<cs> i scarcely think that the phrase internal decorative repair means crumbly window sills <e> <s> that is a great deal more than a decorative repair <e> <s> it is a technical phrase and i think it merely enjoins the local authority not to worry too much about the paintwork <e> <s> if i am wrong about that i will communicate with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i am sure that that is what local authorities will do they will take into account the various matters which they are told to before approving an application <e> <s> i do not think there will be different classes of approval according to the age or the condition of the house <e>", "<cs> i think that the problem here is one of definition <e> <s> the difficulty about the amendment of the noble viscount is that it would also bring in farm buildings such as barns and so on which can be insured and which most farmers do insure and certainly should insure <e> <s> i think that we have to re-define the problem <e> <s> where we have houses factories and commercial premises the owners are able to insure themselves against damage caused by a water burst in exactly the same way as they insure themselves against many other kinds of risks <e> <s> farmers basically speaking are in a different position because they cannot insure their land and crops against damage from burst water mains <e> <s> it has been a source of grievance to them for many years that they can neither claim damages from the water authority unless they can prove negligence nor can they insure against damage caused by water bursts and therefore they were in a very invidious position and the government decided that something should be done about it <e>", "<cs> with respect the noble lord has got it wrong <e> <s> if the water authority is negligent then it is liable in any event <e> <s> we are talking about strict liability when it is not negligent <e> <s> i say that if a risk is insurable then it is up to the farmer to insure it <e> <s> if his property is damaged then he has two lines of defence <e> <s> first he can try to sue the water authority that caused the damage and if he can prove negligence then he and his insurance company will be very pleased <e> <s> if he cannot do so he then gets his insurance money in respect of the damage <e> <s> it is only when there is damage caused but where negligence cannot be laid at the door of the water authority that the trouble arises <e> <s> therefore i repeat that where you have land and crops they are generally speaking uninsurable and at the same time there is no strict liability in scotland and so the farmer falls as it were between two stools <e> <s> what we were prepared to do and i may say that it was a course of action which was not welcomed by the convention of scottish local authorities because of course the water authorities in scotland are very different creatures from what they are in england was to extend the principle to include the farmers uninsurable risks <e> <s> however that is really as far as i can go <e>", "<cs> yes of course <e> <s> i have stated the principle behind what the government are trying to do in other words it is to give the farmer a fallback position on his uninsurable risk <e> <s> that is what we want do to <e> <s> if the noble viscount lord thurso has discovered that what we are in fact intending to do is not going to be done by the way in which the bill is drafted then i shall certainly do something about it <e>", "<cs> my noble friends amendment draws attention to a drafting error in an amendment to the act contained in the tenants rights etc <e> <s> scotland act <e> <s> i understand that the building societies association finds this confusing <e> <s> however to amend the act directly as the amendment suggests would require the long title of this bill to be widened in its scope and this is not possible at this stage of the bills progress <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend is not one of those who is noted for his procrastination <e> <s> i anticipate that he will be in a position to make a statement some time after the summer recess <e> <s> regarding consultations and discussions with other countries exploratory discussions have been held at ministerial official and industrial levels with the united states and with the europeans that is to say the french and the germans and contact has also been made with the japanese <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have accurate information to answer either of those two questions <e> <s> i will write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not altogether agree with my noble friend <e> <s> on the information that i have fast reactor technology is unlikely to become commercially viable before the next century <e> <s> at that time the need for generating capacity and the fuel supply situation may well be very different <e> <s> the objective of the government therefore is to ensure that we have access to that technology when we need it <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect that goes rather wide of the review which my right honourable friend is making as to policy at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is in those circumstances and considering all the various aspects of the matter some of which are extremely technical as my noble friend will realise that my right honourable friend is still cogitating and will make his statement in due course <e> <s> but i anticipate that it will be sooner rather than later <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that i have no information on the first supplementary question <e> <s> i am very conscious that safety concerns us all <e> <s> therefore i can give the noble lord the assurance that if there was an eventual decision to build a commercial scale fast reactor anywhere in the united kingdom that would have to be subject to safety clearances and i have no doubt that there would be a very searching public inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that my right honourable friend and his advisers are only too aware of the efforts of this committee but i will draw the attention of my right honourable friend and his department to what the noble lord said <e>", "<cs> my lords the dounreay nuclear establishment currently has a full programme of work in support of the united kingdom fast reactor programme <e> <s> the importance of the establishment to the economy of the highland region is well recognised by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect the noble viscount must not make leaps into the dark particularly when they are not wholly logical <e> <s> i do agree with him that the long-term future of dounreay is of necessity dependent on the outcome of the governments present consideration of fast reactor policy <e> <s> i know that my right honourable friend is very well aware of the key role if i may so call it <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the last part of the noble lords remarks <e> <s> i do not want another invergordon anywhere in scotland or for that matter anywhere in the united kingdom <e> <s> but of necessity conditions change and they have changed in the last years <e> <s> that is why the review is going on in the way that it is and that is why my right honourable friend is considering the future <e> <s> as i have said he is well aware of the importance of the present programme of dounreay and any future role it may have in the local economy <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly draw that to the attention of my right honourable friend although as the noble lord will appreciate he is going slightly wide of future work at dounreay <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that is no doubt one of the factors that my right honourable friend is considering <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the noble earls point about a possible debate is concerned i am sure that the usual channels who are here and as always aware of the moods of the house will make the necessary arrangements in due course <e> <s> it may be that when my right honourable friend makes his statement that will be the occasion on which to arrange a debate <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be remiss of me not to commence this report stage by welcoming the noble lord back from the iberian peninsula <e> <s> if i hear any cries behind me of haste ye back <e>", "<cs> my lords the words about which the noble lord lord ross complains in fact stop up a loophole of which recalcitrant local authorities might otherwise avail themselves to frustrate the secretary of states desire to prevent them from maintaining expenditure at excessive and unreasonable levels <e> <s> what would happen if these words were excised from the bill would be that local authorities could borrow right up to the moment when a rate reduction becomes effective they could take money out of their loans fund they could build up funds which would allow them to maintain excessive and unreasonable expenditure at that rate and therefore they would be in a position to frustrate the secretary of state <e> <s> the government machine does not move at exactly lightning speed when it comes to these matters and therefore <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to seek the leave of the house to speak again and i hope i may be forgiven for saying the house has been rather generous on report stages recently but i do not intend to make a practice of it <e> <s> the noble lord lord hughes is quite right there is nothing that the secretary of state or anybody else can do to stop a local authority from behaving in this way <e> <s> but it would be illegal the officials of the local authority would know that it was illegal they would have their statutory responsibility and so might the various councillors who voted for such a measure <e> <s> therefore nemesis would creep up in the end and that of course is something which all properly and lawfully constituted local authorities have regard to when they consider their actions <e>", "<cs> the noble lord who moved the amendment has the right to speak again <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that if the noble lord considers the subsection with a little more care he will see that in fact the words are not only desirable but will enable the secretary of state to have flexibility which would otherwise be denied to him and a flexibility which could react in favour of individual local authorities <e> <s> the provision is drafted in terms which make it clear that should the secretary of state consider it appropriate to permit an authority to use money from the loans fund to offset the effect of a rate reduction he would exercise that permission having regard to the circumstances of the individual authority concerned <e> <s> this is consistent with the provisions in clause to which clause relates <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords amendment is unnecessary but i hasten to add not otiose <e> <s> i entirely agree that there is a need for consultation with the convention before rate support grant is redetermined initially <e> <s> the words <e>", "<cs> my lords it is provided for in amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ross reminded us of his teaching background <e> <s> i must say i have always wondered where giles was moved to get old chalky from but i must speculate about that <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly would not want to mix it if i may use such an expression with the noble lord on grammatical terms <e> <s> but having viewed with some alarm the noble lords amendment and consulted among others the draftsman i am assured that the convention in statute is that the term local authority should be predicated in the plural <e> <s> in fact later amendments will ensure that consistency of approach is adopted throughout the bill <e> <s> thus the use of the verb are in line reflects this general doctrine and is i think consistent with the expression although it occasionally looks rather odd as in for example <e>", "<cs> my lords it is only your lordships house that can spend minutes on a matter which is so totally unimportant as this <e>", "<cs> i enjoyed the remarks of the noble lord lord george-brown my lords patronising as they were and of course my title is a matter for me it is not double-barrelled nor does it have a hyphen <e> <s> i will not waste any more time except to say i hope that if the worst ever happens and we have a government of a different persuasion with the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey as lord advocate so that he is responsible for the drafting of scottish bills he will have a little more loyalty to his draftsmen than he has shown on this occasion <e> <s> having said that i do not think i can say other than that rules are made to be broken and i think they should be broken in this particular case and accordingly i am happy to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am of course aware that fears have been expressed in particular by theatres and theatre trusts as to the financial future under the new arrangements <e> <s> it was for that reason that clause which empowers regional councils to contribute to the provision or maintenance of leisure and recreation facilities or activities has been drawn as widely as it has been drawn <e> <s> in another place there was criticism of the original provision and in consequence of that there is now no limitation on the powers to contribute provided of course that the council wishes to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord drumalbyn has already pointed out this matter has exercised both the other place and your lordships house on a number of occasions and i think that the areas of debate are fairly well defined <e> <s> i shall not go into all the avenues which we explored in committee because most of the points are fairly well known <e> <s> but i think that i should encapsulate my arguments in small compass because it is something which exercises the minds of a number of your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords once again the noble lords lord hughes has spoken briefly but cogently to both amendments snd and i shall do the same <e> <s> as noble lords have said the matter of the sale of council houses was one which we debated at very considerable length when the tenants rights bill as it then was went through your lordships house in <e>", "<cs> my lords i confess to a faint feeling of pique that the noble viscount simply will not accept the effect of the advice which i gave him by letter <e> <s> i undertook in committee to consider whether the existing wording of the clause covered such items as ditches culverts fences and drains <e> <s> i have fulfilled my undertaking <e> <s> i have written to the noble viscount and i said to him in the letter that other structures do cover these things and indeed i can say shelter belts too <e> <s> but apparently the noble viscount will not be persuaded that his concern is misplaced <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble lords question in short is no <e> <s> as the noble lord will know the water authorities are the local authorities in scotland and not a separate statutory body as they are in england <e> <s> it has been a bone of contention for some time that the english farmers had this rule of strict liability and the scottish farmers had none <e> <s> during consultations which have now gone on for over two years just about as long as i have been in the government the scottish local authorities naturally enough were unwilling to undertake further possible financial burdens which were not already enjoined upon them or imposed upon them by statute <e>", "<cs> one of the finest racecourses my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to noble lords who have taken part in the debate <e> <s> i wondered when the noble lord lord ross was speaking what was the point to which he was gradually drawing <e> <s> eventually it was a mixture of i told you so and having it both ways accusing the government of acting at best with incompetence and at worst in bad faith <e> <s> so there was nothing new about that <e>", "<cs> yes my lords of course we could bring in primary legislation and parliament can do whatever it likes in primary legislation <e> <s> what i was saying was that short of such drastic action and bearing in mind that the revaluation will be within two and a half years there is nothing that can be done short of a change of circumstances <e> <s> as i have said i do not think i can take the matter further <e> <s> it is unfortunate that the period between revaluations is going to extend for this extra period but i hope i have convinced the house that it has been done with good reasons and from the best of motives <e> <s> on that note i commend the motion to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their said amendment <e> <s> perhaps i can speak also to amendment no <e> <s> to save time <e> <s> by way of very short preface the marshalled list contains what at first glance would seem to be a formidable list of amendments <e> <s> perhaps i can reassure your lordships by saying that a great many of the amendments fall quite conveniently into groupings <e> <s> therefore with the leave of the house i shall be able to move a great many of them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will know that these provisions were intoduced in the other place on report in response to a debate which took place in committee to the effect that

reached without unreasonable delay <e> <s> a cut-off date within which the district council must dispose of the application was suggested <e> <s> members accepted that an absolute cut-off point could present problems for the authority who would not with the best will in the world have been able to complete necessary inquiries on the application within the prescribed period <e> <s> i think this

britoil is fair against the background of todays market conditions <e> <s> of course it will shortly be tested in the market <e> <s> i do not think there is any reason to believe that we could have obtained a better price by delaying the sale <e> <s> so far as the valuation is concerned the minimum tender price is p per share and the total shares are valued at billion <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the value of the share issue <e> <s> if the noble lord was referring as i think he was to the net asset value i see him nodding he will know very well that is not some sort of objective measure which can be translated directly into a market price for the shares <e> <s> it is a calculation which has to be made on more or less arbitrary assumptions about future oil prices <e> <s> exchange rates and oil production rates from fields some of which have not yet even been developed <e> <s> so it may be of value in making comparisons as between one company and another but i do not think it is an indication of a fair market price <e>", "<cs> my lords the meaning of tender is the normal meaning of the english word and the actual mechanics of the operation are in the back of the prospectus <e> <s> i have had it in my own hands for only a comparatively short time but as i understand it it is perfectly normal <e>", "<cs> my lords one puts in ones application with the tendered price <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know and i am not sure that it would be proper for me to give it to the house even if i did the reason being that it is a fee which is incurred by the department of energy and nothing to do with britoil in the preparation of this flotation <e>", "<cs> my lords it is quite impossible to answer that question now <e> <s> the number of small shareholders will only be realised when the striking price is declared <e> <s> therefore the number and extent of their shareholding so far as small shareholders are concerned can be ascertained <e> <s> i hope therefore that the noble lord will see that one cannot quantify it <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honorable friend reserves to himself the right to refuse any application so whether the buyer was a very rich german capitalist or a very rich german marxist makes no difference <e>", "<cs> my lords the striking price will be the minimum price which has been tendered in order to ensure that the applicant receives his shares <e>", "<cs> my lords i really do not think there is need for any confusion <e> <s> the applications are made and the tenders are received <e> <s> the government then have to work out the striking price and do a sum which will ensure that the number of shares on offer reflects those applicants who are above the striking price and the number of small shareholders who as i have said make their application without entering any price at all <e> <s> in that way the amount of shares which will be awarded if that is the correct word to these small shareholders will be ascertained <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i think that a perusal of the prospectus in the library or as from friday in the newspapers or as from next monday in the main branches of the clearing banks the trustee savings banks and the main post offices probably would be fruitful <e>", "<cs> my lords it certainly would not be appropriate to have a debate upon the prospectus of a company which is being issued in the manner in which this one is <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes to raise the matter then i am sure that he will do so through the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all noble lords who have spoken in this debateif i may say so i think there has generally been a welcome for the bill <e> <s> i was particularly struck <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord at least for interrupting me before i had really got started and i shall cause inquiries to be made <e> <s> i anticipate that with smithfield just along the road and with christmas shopping in progress it may be that my noble friend is finding it not altogether easy to attend the house <e>", "<cs> my lords turning to the noble lord lord mackie i think he had one particular query if that is the word in relation to clause that is to say the possible consultation before consent is given to treatment <e> <s> the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> there is no express provision for relatives to be consulted but i can assure the noble lord that in practice it would be customary for the doctors treating a patient to consult his or her relatives where they are known to the doctor and where they are obviously concerned for the care and welfare of their relative <e> <s> of course it does not always happen <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord for his welcome to this bill <e> <s> there is only one matter which i need take up and that is the matter of the standing charges <e> <s> as the house will know in england and wales the effect of the new pronouncement will be that standing charges will be limited to per cent <e> <s> of one bill <e> <s> in scotland we have a rather different system <e> <s> the south of scotland electricity board do not have a standing charge but they operate a two-part tariff which is rather more favourable i was going to say to the poor consumer but i am not sure that that is right to the consumer of low quantities of electricity than is the standing charge <e> <s> the north of scotland hydro-electric board have a standing charge but i understand that both scottish electricity boards will be considering the implications of the electricity councils request to area boards in england and wales to implement this proposal <e> <s> i am advised that they will complete their deliberations before very long <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> this is a short <e>", "<cs> my lords i am mildly astonished that this two-clause bill should have occupied the attention of the house for so long <e> <s> when we were discussing the electricity financial provisions scotland bill a few moments ago the noble lord lord ross was moved to say that in another place they had been fairly discursive in their consideration of the bill <e> <s> but my goodness me <e> <s> in a speech of eleven minutes on this particular bill he fairly showed them how even going so far as to talk about election manifestos <e> <s> however it all goes to show what a good puff can do <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe puts me in something of a difficulty if not on the spot because what i was going to say to the committee and still intend to say is that there are features of both amendments nos <e> <s> and which the government find attractive but there are rather more features of the amendment of the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe than there are of the amendment of the noble lord lord ross of marnock that is amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> what i shall do is say what it is that we find attractive about both amendments and then invite the noble lord lord ross of marnock to withdraw his amendment <e> <s> i hope that we shall bring forward at report stage an amendment which will commend itself to both noble lords and to your lordships house <e>", "<cs> i thought it was implicit in what i said that bearing in mind that the bill is very much in embryonic form at committee stage in your lordships house the government are quite flexible on the matter of numbers <e> <s> i think that by conceding the principle of both amendments i have made it clear that it is the view of the government that more commissioners will be needed <e> <s> i think my only reaction to what the noble lord has said is to say that what i am asking for is that there should be the maximum flexibility <e> <s> i think we can leave it to the good sense of the secretary of state advised by his officials and indeed by the commission itself to determine the number of commissioners there should be <e> <s> if the noble lord really wants me to write a lower <e>", "<cs> when the mental welfare commission was established in it was not unusual for members of bodies such as the commission to be appointed to hold office for a very long time indeed <e> <s> indeed they were appointed to hold office until attaining the age of years <e> <s> since the practice has been for members of the commission like those of health boards and a good many other bodies to be appointed for four-year terms of office <e> <s> there are now only three members including the chairman who hold office under the previous arrangements and all three are due to retire within the next three or four years <e> <s> i do not see any merit in limiting the number of terms of office which may be served by either the chairman or any other member of the commission <e>", "<cs> there are all manner of bodies which the secretary of state consults before making a very large number of appointments as the noble lord lord ross knows very well <e> <s> bodies can although they have not in the past include voluntary organisations but there is no reason why consultation should not extend for instance to bodies such as the scottish society for the mentally handicapped and the scottish association for mental health <e> <s> it might well be that such bodies would want to put forward nominees and it would be up to the secretary of state to consider them and place such reliance on them as he thought fit <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e> <s> i did not catch what my noble friend said <e>", "<cs> no i think not <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say that i tried to keep the debate to my own amendment and not go to the amendment of the noble lord lord taylor which i am not happy to accept or indeed to the amendment of the noble lord lord winstanley which i shall be happy to accept but a long time later i fancy <e>", "<cs> i had hoped that i had given a fairly reasonable undertaking to the committee in relation to my amendment amendment no <e> <s> which is in fact an alternative to the noble lords amendment but which if i may say so is a much more acceptable one <e> <s> we realise and accept that there will perhaps have to be wider consultation than there has been in the past <e> <s> as i said there has been a good deal of informal consultation and that takes place with a variety of bodies <e> <s> it has not extended to the major voluntary organisations and i think that in future it will have to do so <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord winstanley raises a point which goes a good deal further than what has so far been said so far as undertakings from me are concerned <e> <s> i did not pursue the first part of the noble lords amendment because that was inherent in our first debate this afternoon where i undertook to bring forward an amendment so far as the numbers and the composition of the body are concerned which i hope will please everybody <e>", "<cs> this is similar to a number of amendments which follow but i will take this one on its own as the noble lord did <e> <s> if accepted it would require rather than enable the mental welfare commission to pay remuneration to commissioners and to make provision for pensions and so on <e> <s> the fact is that some commissioners may not wish to receive any remuneration <e> <s> for example lord mcdonald the chairman as a high court judge is prevented by virtue of his office from accepting remuneration <e> <s> thus if may was changed to shall it would be forcing the commission to do what some of the commissioners would not want it to do <e>", "<cs> i seem to have heard the noble lords argument before on this matter in some of the other legislation that we have dealt with in the last three and a half years or so <e> <s> this is a perfectly ordinary power a permissive power that in future the commission which as i have said is responsible for its <e>", "<cs> clause inserts this new subsection a into section of the principal act <e> <s> subsection a applies to the mental welfare commission as they apply to a health board certain provisions of the national health service scotland act as amended by the health services act and these provisions will enable the secretary of state to meet the expenses of the commission and will oblige the commission to maintain accounts and observe other financial proprieties <e> <s> without these provisions the commission will not be able to function because there will be no means of defraying their expenditure <e> <s> what in fact this does is to regularise the funding of the commission <e>", "<cs> that is right <e>", "<cs> there is a very good reason in this particular instance <e> <s> if we take amendments nos <e> <s> and together it would in effect mean that the secretary of state would be under a duty to provide the commission with such accommodation and so on as they may require <e> <s> if we equate the word require with demand then the commission would be in a very enviable position indeed <e> <s> i do not believe that any secretary of state would want to be under that duty <e> <s> in this particular instance i say all the more strongly that this is a case where the secretary of state should be provided with a power <e> <s> he obviously must have power to enable him to provide the commission with accommodation <e> <s> it is quite unnecessary for him to have to be under a duty to do so <e> <s> i do not believe that any secretary of state is likely to leave the commission without a roof over its head <e> <s> equally he should not be placed under a duty by statute to have to give whatever they shall require of him <e>", "<cs> they have to have the cash <e>", "<cs> it is becoming increasingly difficult for me to reconcile the evident desire of the noble lord lord ross to extend the function of the commission with his apparent desire to render the body completely ineffective and worse than that inactive <e> <s> his amendment no <e> <s> would have deprived the body of all financial support this amendment taken with a desire to leave out clause which comes later will deprive them of all their staff <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is perfectly right <e> <s> this is what i might describe as a top-up power to help out so far as staff is concerned in an emergency <e>", "<cs> i understand the desire of the noble lord to require the commission i think i am more or less using the words he used to move into a more general arena <e> <s> the way the noble lord intends to do it is by inserting the words individually or collectively and secondly the words require care or into the existing provision <e> <s> i have to say to the noble lord that the word persons is not made any more general by adding these words individually or collectively <e> <s> the expression <e>", "<cs> i sympathise with my noble friend <e> <s> this method of textual amendment of previous acts is not one which means that one can pick up the bill and immediately understand what the government are trying to do <e> <s> what i said to the noble lord lord taylor was that so far as the powers and functions are concerned the mental welfare commission can already do what he seeks to allow them to do by virtue of the amendment <e> <s> they are perfectly capable of doing that as the original section stands <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ross was out of the chamber at the beginning of my original discourse and i shall not weary the committee with a repeat of it <e> <s> but one must get straight if one can the fact that there are two aspects to this question <e> <s> first there are the powers of the commission and secondly there is the question of their duty and how it is that they shall be enjoined so far as a statute can enjoin a body such as this to carry out that duty <e> <s> what i have said so far as amendment no <e> <s> is concerned is that the words which the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe seeks to insert into the bill will not give the commission any new powers over and above those which they already possess <e> <s> indeed they can do everything which is in effect implied by the words in the amendment of the noble lord lord taylor <e> <s> so that so far as the legalities are concerned the amendment is not advancing us one whit <e>", "<cs> subsection of section <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord taylor has taken me slightly by surprise because i am bound to say that i read his amendment which is now amendment no <e> <s> a with amendment no <e> <s> and concluded that the object of the exercise so far as the noble lord is concerned was to exclude medical commissioners from the commission in other words to have what i might call a lay commission <e> <s> that is not his desire <e> <s> i will be perfectly frank with the committee <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord said the amendment would require the mental welfare commission to conduct what i might describe as a nationwide survey of all local authority accommodation in which mentally ill people might be housed and to report to the secretary of state on the adequacy of the arrangements no doubt not only as regards accommodation but on associated services possibly before the end of <e> <s> that would be a herculean task <e> <s> the commission do not have the resources to carry out such a survey and even if the necessary professional staff could be devoted to the task it could not be done thoroughly within the timescale which the noble lord lays down <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no desire and certainly no intention of being drawn into a debate on the state of the national health service in scotland or indeed the secretarys of states block vote and how he spends it <e> <s> all i can say is that the ratio which has been maintained for some years is still being maintained and scotland gets more than its fair share of resources although i do not trumpet that about too loudly in the presence of the english <e> <s> if the secretary of state wanted to do so he could devote such resources as he wanted in order to enable this body to carry out the survey which the noble lord wants <e> <s> but i have tried to explain to him that i think it would be money that would be ill spent <e> <s> it is very much better rather than identifying problems which are already obvious to all and not least to the local authorities to use that money to try to improve the services as and when the local authorities can do so <e> <s> for that reason i reject the entire contention behind the noble lords remarks <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord taylor quite rightly points out that under subsection b which is part of amendment no <e> <s> it will be the duty of the mental welfare commission to bring to the attention of the secretary of state a health board or a local authority or any other body for that matter certain matters which the commission consider ought to be brought to his or their attention <e> <s> therefore that gives them discretion as to how they are to advise the secretary of state or the local authority <e>", "<cs> we have had a good debate on this matter and we have passed amendment no <e> <s> into the bill <e> <s> i am of course always sympathetic to anything that the noble lord lord taylor suggests that i do but i cannot give him any undertaking other than to look at it <e>", "<cs> amendments which have already been passed into the bill have in effect meant that clause is surplus to requirements if i may use that phrase <e> <s> so i shall not be content for it to stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> we have to go back to section of the principal act as the noble lord lord ross quite rightly directed us <e> <s> it is necessary to distinguish between routine investigation of complaints or incidents and formal inquiries carried out by the mental welfare commission under the provisions which are set out in paragraph of schedule <e> <s> these provisions are to be more conveniently relocated after section of the principal act as a new section a <e>", "<cs> i want to direct the noble lord lord ross to what it is that he is complaining about in schedule <e> <s> if i may be a touch vulgar for a moment this is not some sort of underhand way of squirting just a little bit more gravy at the legal profession <e> <s> this is in respect of one part of the commissions activities when they are in fact instituting formal inquiries <e> <s> the proceedings in a formal inquiry by the commission have the privilege of a court of law for instance and in many ways the proceedings have the character of court proceedings <e> <s> therefore if the commission are not in a position to call upon the services of a legally qualified person to conduct the proceedings they may well find themselves in difficulties and not be able to carry out the formal inquiry which they intend to and which they have to in certain circumstances <e>", "<cs> i have referred the noble lord to paragraph of schedule which sets out these inquiries <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord would care to withdraw his amendment then he can peruse all this while we get on with the next one <e> <s> it is in schedule to this bill <e>", "<cs> as i understand it what the noble lord is seeking to ensure is that the medically qualified commissioners of the mental welfare commission shall not in fact sit other than in judgment over the efforts of other people <e> <s> that i think is something for which i do not have a great deal of sympathy <e> <s> historically the medical commissioners have visited patients and examined them <e> <s> they have inspected medical records <e> <s> indeed in many cases the work of the commission i will not say would be affected fatally but would be considerably hindered unless the person undertaking the particular task in relation to whatever it is that the commission are doing is not only medically qualified but is a member of the commission <e>", "<cs> the medical commissioners act as what i might call the executive directors of the commission that is a convenient shorthand way of describing their role <e> <s> it would of course be possible for them not to do that in other words for professional people to be employed to carry out the work they presently do in this field but what the noble lord has not produced are any arguments as to whether the system is wrong and if so why it is wrong <e>", "<cs> i give that undertaking but i could not give any commitment other than that <e>", "<cs> we have been round this course before <e> <s> as the committee knows and as the noble lord lord ross certainly knows at present the mental welfare commission borrow staff civil servants if you like from the secretary of state to carry out their role <e> <s> there are a number of disadvantages in that <e> <s> for example it can be suggested and has been that because of it the commission are not as independent as they should be though they are carrying out a very independent role <e> <s> it also means that the staff have first to become civil servants before they can work for the commission <e> <s> it was therefore decided that the commission should as it were stand to one side from the scottish office and be given the power to employ their own staff and to enable them to do that we have these perfectly routine provisions <e> <s> clause in effect applies ordinary enabling powers to the commission so that they may employ people and pay them <e>", "<cs> i gather that they meet in melville street in edinburgh <e> <s> whether they will thank me for giving their address to the noble lord lord ross i do not know <e>", "<cs> probably the secretary of state for scotland as they are a creature of the secretary of state <e> <s> they owe their existence and their continued existence to the secretary of state <e> <s> it comes from his block <e> <s> i thought i had said that four five or six times this evening <e>", "<cs> there are two amendments and really two questions in the way that this debate has proceeded <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is simply a matter of language <e> <s> if it were accepted then the expression mental deficiency would remain in use as opposed to it being replaced by mental handicap <e> <s> i take into account the views of the committee about this obviously but i agree with the noble lord lord ross that there has been considerable pressure to replace the term which is regarded in some circles as being derogatory <e> <s> it is something which i can very well understand <e> <s> if we were now to replace mental handicap by the old term of mental deficiency there would be a good deal of disappointment <e> <s> but as i say i am very much in the hands of the committee <e> <s> if there was a consensus of opinion that the term mental handicap was unsatisfactory or undesirable i would at once undertake to take the matter away and have more consultations <e> <s> i should not like to accept amendment no <e> <s> tonight <e>", "<cs> the term was mentally deficient <e> <s> may i try to help the noble baroness by saying that it is an argument though i do not believe it is a very strong one and i do not see why we in scotland should follow the english if so to speak our own people are urging us not to do so <e>", "<cs> just so that there shall be no mistake and i do not think there should have been in view of what i said earlier i said that i was really in the hands of the committee and that the government had prepared this legislation as a result of a lot of pressure but that if there was pressure from the committee on me to reconsider what had been done i would go away and reconsider it <e> <s> as things stand however i have to say to the noble lord lord taylor that a lot of people in scotland are pressing for the change in expression <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ross of marnock spoke to his amendment on the last occasion when amendment no <e> <s> was discussed and i also spoke at length <e> <s> i do not think that i can really say very much more <e> <s> what i have tried to say is that although one has considerable sympathy with the relatives and those who are concerned with the mentally handicapped i do not think the mentally handicapped themselves either know or care what is <e>", "<cs> the scottish definition of mental disorder which is set out in section of the <e>", "<cs> i think that i had better take the matter away and make some inquiries as to why it was considered necessary to have this declaratory subsection <e> <s> it may be that it would be better out but i shall see what i can do <e>", "<cs> i can be brief in my reply to what has been said <e> <s> it may help save time if i anticipate what i imagine the noble baroness is going to say in support of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the government accept that a specific provision in relation to after-care should be included in the bill <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross has it right in seeking to include the provision in section of the principal act and that it should apply to all mental patients <e> <s> the draftsmen do not altogether like his wording but if he will withdraw the amendment for now i shall undertake to come forward with a government amendment at a later stage to give effect in substantial measure to what is proposed both in this amendment no <e> <s> and in amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> this amendment seems to me to duplicate arrangements which already exist for co-operation between local authorities health boards and voluntary organisations not just for the mentally disordered but across the wide spectrum of health care provided in hospitals of various kinds and in the community for different client groups <e> <s> under section of the national health service scotland act health boards and local authorities already have a statutory duty to co-operate with one another <e> <s> in the secretary of state for scotland in a circular addressed to local authorities and health boards strongly supported the setting up of joint liaison committees between health boards and local authorities <e> <s> this was one of a number of recommendations made by a working party comprising representatives of health boards local authorities and the scottish office which was set up in to examine the pattern of relationships between health boards and local government and to advise on any special arrangements which might facilitate or improve the relationship <e>", "<cs> i am not going to quarrel with the noble lord <e> <s> i will accept his amendment <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> the effect of the amendment would be to transfer from local authorities to the secretary of state the responsibility for approving persons who are to be appointed as mental health officers as having appropriate competence in dealing with persons suffering from mental disorder <e> <s> as the clause stands no person is to be appointed a mental health officer unless he is approved by the local authority as having appropriate competence <e> <s> so the question is whether it is to be the local authority or the secretary of state who makes the decision <e>", "<cs> i am prepared to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> if i may first of all reply to the actual narrow amendment of my noble friend competence is the right word because one can have the capacity to do something and yet not be competent until one has been trained <e> <s> if one has not the capacity one is unlikely ever to become competent <e> <s> that is the essential difference <e>", "<cs> i would rather not do so <e>", "<cs> i am prepared to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am with the noble lord in principle but the draftsmen are not wholly with him <e> <s> if he will withdraw the amendment i shall take it away and produce something else <e>", "<cs> the effect of this amendment would be to require the nearest relative to apply to the local authority in writing <e> <s> most relatives in this predicament are faced with the urgent need to make an application and they are more likely to make it by telephone or in person therefore it would be inappropriate to require this application to be in writing <e> <s> indeed it would negate the purpose of the provision <e> <s> the whole point is to ensure that a nearest relative can obtain help when he or she may well be uncertain as to the steps to take <e> <s> one has to visualise the situation where the nearest relative will probably be in some emotional state <e> <s> he or she will probably have undergone an experience which will not be very pleasant and is therefore driven to make the application <e>", "<cs> the provision in this part of the clause is to avoid a fortunately rare possibility in which a mental health officer could find himself on the horns of a somewhat awkward dilemma <e> <s> circumstances can arise in which a psychiatrist who believes that a patient ought to be detained has no choice but to ask a mental health officer to make the necessary application <e> <s> if the mental health officer honestly believes that the application should not be made he must either suppress his own views and make it or else take the risk that if the patient does for example commit suicide he will be blamed for having brought about this tragic outcome by refusing to co-operate <e>", "<cs> i take it that the noble baroness would like me to deal with amendment no <e> <s> first because it is a very different matter from no <e> <s> <e> <s> the provisions which apply in this clause are identical in effect to those which were debated at considerable length in the house less than a year ago in connection with the amendment of the equivalent legislation in england and wales <e> <s> in scotland we go our own way where there is a good reason for doing so or where we prefer our own methods <e> <s> but in this event i do not think that there is any good reason for taking a different line on provisions which i suggest reflect a sensible compromise on a contentious issue <e>", "<cs> i think i can take it that my noble friend lord campbell is concerned solely with geographical troubles and is not really suggesting that the period of seven days should not be reduced to hours as it were on merit <e> <s> if that is so i think his concern is perhaps misplaced and i say that for this reason <e> <s> if one goes to section of the act one can see there that three days are allowed for the removal of the patient and the period of detention does not begin until the patient is admitted to the hospital <e> <s> in other words what we are saying is that even if somebody is to be removed from the western isles to let us say inverness a period of no less than three days is allowed for them to get there <e> <s> the period of hours during which the patient may be detained in hospital naturally begins only when he is admitted to the hospital and it is of course that period which is designed to provide sufficient time for a psychiatrist to decide whether further detention is necessary <e>", "<cs> with whatever sanity i possess i must say i have knocked all round the western isles in all sorts of weather in the last three and a half years and i have never taken anything like hours to get back to edinburgh or glasgow <e> <s> i think what i should do is this <e> <s> as my noble friend says that apparently the medical gentlemen have expressed anxieties to him that is something i must go into <e> <s> i shall do that if he will be good enough to withdraw his amendment for now <e>", "<cs> on the face of it the proposal in clause might i suppose constitute an unjustifiable addition to the existing powers to detain patients and be contrary to the spirit of the act <e> <s> it is however of the essence of the act that a patient should not be detained unless it is absolutely necessary <e> <s> if a patient is willing to enter hospital voluntarily for the treatment which he requires he should not be detained simply because there is a possibility that he may at some time act unpredictably so as to place himself or others at risk <e> <s> it surely follows in full accordance with the spirit of the act that powers should be available to prevent a voluntary patient from leaving hospital if it is thought that serious harm would be likely to result from his doing so if for example he had made it clear that his intention was to commit suicide <e>", "<cs> he has put down three amendments <e>", "<cs> i suppose that my desire to limit the debate to a reasonable time was probably ill advised <e> <s> as regards amendment no <e> <s> i accept the principle of the amendment but not its form <e> <s> if the noble lord will seek to withdraw it i will arrange for a substitute to be prepared <e>", "<cs> this is very similar to section of the mental health amendment act <e> <s> nurses of the prescribed class are nurses who have experience of these particular types of mental care <e> <s> i am not sure whether the noble lord is actually attacking what is proposed <e> <s> nursing organisations including the confederation of health service employees have requested that some provision be made to clarify their position <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has already said it is the secretary of state who will prescribe <e> <s> he is to make an order and will lay down those registered nurses who are qualified in mental illness or mental deficiency <e> <s> there are classifications of registered mental nurse and registered nurse in mental deficiency <e>", "<cs> i do not know the precise details of who can be classified as a registered mental nurse but i shall try to obtain the information as to the sort of order that the secretary of state is likely to make when he carries out his duty under subsection of this clause <e>", "<cs> i am not at all certain that i can help the committee <e> <s> if a patient can only be detained once the nurse has made a record he can walk out of the hospital while the record is being made <e> <s> the noble lords amendment is unnecessary and would merely remove an explicit statement of what is in any case implied <e> <s> in a matter of interpretation it is clear that the patient can be held while the record is being made and the time taken to enter a few details on a prepared form would only be a matter of moments <e>", "<cs> i am not in a position to give chapter and verse as to the representations which have been made by the nursing professsion that in this particular instance scotland should go down the same road as england and wales <e> <s> i am slightly surprised that the noble lord had taken against clause quite so fiercely <e> <s> it is a difficulty which can arise that a voluntary patient who has arrived in circumstances where he would be a voluntary patient able to go announces that he is going to go and a nurse is certian that a tragedy could very well ensue if the patient is allowed to leave particularly for instance if he announces or it is obvious that he is going to commit suicide <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether the noble baroness was in her place when we were discussing the last amendment regarding after-care but i then gave the undertaking that not only would i consider it but i would bring forward a government amendment on the subject <e>", "<cs> it may not have been included but i included it specifically <e>", "<cs> if one considers clause as opposed to section for instance of the act in fact this clause introduces new provisions which much reduce the present powers to intercept patient correspondence <e> <s> the reason for the change is that it is felt that patients should enjoy their freedoms unless there is good reason to take them away and that of course is entirely consistent with the european convention on human rights <e> <s> as i say clause liberalises the rgime as far as patients correspondence is concerned <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i always do read the letters because i always feel that among the dross one is going to find a nugget of gold <e> <s> it occasionally happens that somebody who is receiving mental treatment and complains bitterly suddenly actually points the finger in the right direction and one is in a position to help them <e> <s> i have found that on more than one occasion but i am afraid i do read all these letters and i read them right through <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for putting me right on subsection <e> <s> of course i shall look at it again <e>", "<cs> i am happy to give that undertaking if the noble lord will withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is right <e> <s> i gave that assurance several hours ago and i am happy to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords to start with perhaps i may reassure the noble lord on the question of shetland <e> <s> as the noble lord will know very well the position of shetland is by no means fixed and firm at the moment <e> <s> what i can say is that my right honour <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot do so without notice <e> <s> i shall have to do some sums which i am ill equipped to do mentally <e> <s> i shall write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to thank noble lords for the general welcome which they have given to the amendments to which i spoke <e> <s> on my noble friends point about the inverted commas i see that in the main act these numbers do not appear in inverted commas and i anticipate therefore that this is a device which is used throughout the amendments as it were to highlight what is being inserted or changed in the bill <e> <s> i am quite certain that there is no intention to be in any way offensive to women <e> <s> if there was that would not be tolerated for very long <e> <s> i will certainly go into that point again <e> <s> i am sure i am right about that <e> <s> the only other matter is the number of women <e> <s> this is a mandatory minimum not a maximum and therefore i think the position is quite satisfactory whoever the chairperson is <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a matter of drafting <e> <s> in the print which i have i have to tell my noble friend that i can see the words a <e> <s> apparently he has an edition which does not include them <e> <s> all i can invite him to do is to foregather with me in some private and congenial place where we can go into it <e> <s> alternatively i shall have the matter looked at before the next stage of the bill <e> <s> i hope that he will withdraw the amendment for now <e>", "<cs> my lords this was a matter to which noble lords addressed their attention in committee <e> <s> i said then to the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe that i would inquire as to whether the mental welfare commission carries out its functions in a way in which taking the situation as it is its judgment might be impaired because that i think is what the noble lord lord taylor is worried about <e> <s> one has to go a little further perhaps and ask could the rights or the welfare of the patients be prejudiced by reason of the fact that three of its members are consultant psychiatrists <e> <s> i think that is what it comes down to <e> <s> i must tell the noble lord that there is nothing to suggest that the presence and activities of three medical commissioners in any way detracts from the impartiality of the commission in the way in which it carries out its tasks merely because three of its members happen to be psychiatrists <e> <s> i have the feeling from what the noble lord said in committee that perhaps he does not fully appreciate how the present arrangements work <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house a minister of the crown is allowed to make <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i must bow to the inevitable and accept this amendment <e> <s> i am a little reluctant to do so <e> <s> i will be happy to be proved wrong but i have the feeling that more effort will go into the production of the annual reports than will be spent in reading them once they are completed <e> <s> however i see that the feeling of your lordships is <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i very nearly had sat down <e> <s> what my noble friend said was and i recorded his words in my note that there was no necessity for the same ground to be covered every year <e> <s> that i would regard as a rather dangerous statement and i think perhaps we could discuss that if we want to in the next amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to dissipate the air of sweet reason which pervades the house this afternoon but i do not think that this amendment is necessary or even desirable for reasons which i shall briefly relate <e> <s> what we are doing now is to require the commission annually to report on their activities and this will include an account of any of their activities under section <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that when we were in committee my argument which i thought was rather powerful failed to convince the noble lord lord ross <e> <s> there are two main reasons why persons in these circumstances should be legally qualified <e> <s> first we must go back and consider the purpose of the amendment made by clause <e> <s> it enables the commission to appoint a person who is legally qualified to conduct or chair inquiries on their behalf <e> <s> at present any commissioner can be appointed by the commission to conduct an inquiry <e> <s> there are only two legally qualified commissioners including the chairman <e> <s> where neither is available to conduct an inquiry there could be problems where the commission consider that the inquiry is of such a nature that it cannot be held by one of the commissioners who is not legally qualified <e> <s> the amendment is intended to overcome that problem <e>", "<cs> my lords clause gives the mental welfare commission power to appoint staff to pay remuneration to staff and persons appointed for various purposes on a casual basis and to make provision for the payment of pensions allowances and gratuities <e> <s> all those are normal for this kind of body <e> <s> what is not normal is for this sort of body to provide accommodation for itself <e> <s> there is no reason and certainly no need for the commission to become directly involved in all the difficulties of providing and maintaining their own accommodation office furniture and equipment and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords it only remains for me to thank all noble lords who have welcomed this provision <e> <s> i think that it will improve the bill and certainly it will improve the standard of after-care services so far as patients are concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me that consideration of this amendment inevitably is going to spill over into amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i say that knowing that the noble lord lord ross will have at least one and possibly two further opportunities of making another speech and so by speaking in front of me on this occasion he is certainly not estopped from repeating or adding to his argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i really do not think that my noble friend was listening to what i was saying <e> <s> already the vast majority of these intended mental health officers undertake a formal course of study either at a university or at a college <e> <s> the piece of paper which they obtain at the successful conclusion of their studies or the conditions in which they can expect to receive it are laid down by the central council for education and training in social work and in effect it is a professional qualification <e> <s> i hope that that answers the first part of my noble friends question <e>", "<cs> not at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to noble lords for their welcome to this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say at once that i agree with my noble friend that when one reads these words they do not arouse enthusiasm and they are not very warm in the sense which my noble friend meant <e> <s> but it has been done deliberately and i shall explain to the house why the phrase is couched in the way that it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am going to accept the noble lords amendment but if i may i will just tell the house what was intended by the words <e> <s> it is quite revealing which i found out when i asked the officials <e> <s> the words were intended to make it clear that before making an application for the compulsory admission and detention of a patient in a hospital the mental health officer was required to interview the patient in an appropriate manner which would ensure that there was real communication with him <e> <s> for example where the patient was not able to understand spoken english either because he could not speak it or was deaf the words were intended to ensure that the interview was conducted in such a way that there was communication with him through for instance the use of an interpreter <e> <s> but i take the view that this is implicit from the obligation to interview the patient <e> <s> it is therefore quite unnecessary to make this explicit by using the words of which the noble lord complains <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends amendment i have belatedly realised is really another probing amendment for i do not believe he is seriously suggesting that a relative should be put in the same position <e> <s> in this particular set of circumstances as a mental health officer <e> <s> if he is then i had better answer him because there is a difficulty in this particular situation and one must try to get over it <e>", "<cs> my lords taking the amendment as i find it that is its effect <e> <s> it would put the relative in the same position as that of a mental health officer and he would be required to make an application <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend does not want that effect because it would do nothing for family relationships <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not said in terms that i think the phraseology or drafting of the bill is wrong <e> <s> i have said it attempts to formulate a solution to what is a very difficult problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for having drawn attention to what is a defect in the bill <e> <s> taking the matter shortly the intention is that the request to the mental health officer should come from the approved medical practitioner that is the psychiatrist who has completed one of the two medical recommendations <e> <s> as my noble friend points out as drafted the bill would leave it open to any psychiatrist to make the request <e> <s> in the circumstances if my noble friend will withdraw his amendment i shall get the draftsmen to make the appropriate change at a later stage <e>", "<cs> my lords it might shorten proceedings if i disregard my own advice and talk now <e> <s> my noble friend put me in some quandary by not moving an amendment which i was going to accept <e>", "<cs> my lords the one my noble friend did not move amendment no <e> <s> i was confidently expecting him to move it but after a lengthy peroration he sat down without having done so <e> <s> my fox has been shot <e> <s> therefore i must deal with the situation as best i can <e> <s> i was going to accept amendments nos <e> <s> and and not the amendment of the noble lord lord ross no <e> <s> because if i may say so it has not improved at all between committee stage and report <e> <s> i thought that my noble friends two amendments nos <e> <s> and were an entirely felicitous way of dealing with a very real difficulty which i think we all see and appreciate <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am not in a position to answer my noble friend at this moment <e> <s> i am busy looking at section <e> <s> i will give my noble friend the information either this evening or later <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down after not moving his amendment i should like to ask him to address himself to section of the act <e> <s> he will see there what the sheriff can do by way of making such inquiries and hearing such persons including the patients and relatives as he thinks fit <e> <s> but i am very happy that he has not moved his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i take it that the noble lord is basing his argument on the rather narrower point of how mentally handicapped people who fall to be detained in a hospital should be treated as opposed to the much wider question which he explored in committee as to whether mentally handicapped people should be legislated for in this bill at all <e> <s> i told the committee and i hope it was accepted i believe it was that at the moment there cannot be any question of separate legislation for the mentally handicapped <e> <s> we have been over that ground and i cannot usefully add to what i said in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the pearls which will no doubt fall from lord winstanleys lips must come at the right place and so may i please have my amendments written into the bill first if that is the wish of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords it is obvious from this debate and i would not try to conceal it even if <e>", "<cs> my lords when i came to read this amendment i appreciated the point which the amendment makes and which the noble lord lord wilson of langside has brought out <e> <s> the effect of the amendment will be to remove a provision which has been generally much welcomed and i do not believe that the amendment would have the effect which the noble lord seeks <e> <s> what we are really discussing here is whether short-term detention should be based on an application either by the nearest relative or mental health officer or as the noble lord would have it on an emergency recommendation followed by a confirmatory report from a psychiatrist <e> <s> that really seems to be the nub of the argument <e> <s> i should have thought that the provisions we have now discussed at considerable length are better from the patients point of view than the alternative which the noble lord has suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down does he realise that whatever profligacy was shown when he was secretary of state in the scottish office we do not now have private jet aircraft <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not our amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the words <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i think it is necessary to distinguish between the processes which lead to the regulations and the actual scrutiny by parliament of the regulations once they are put into legislative form <e> <s> i fully understand the anxieties which have led my noble friend to table the amendments <e> <s> i know that some members of the medical profession are worried that there will not be full consultations <e> <s> i must emphasise that the secretary of state has promised the profession that there will he full consultations with both the medical profession and any others before any regulations are made to specify forms of treatment for the purposes of the new provisions in clause <e> <s> the regulations will not include an arbitrary selection of forms of treatment but only those which are the subject of particular concern and only after full consideration of all the implications <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend makes it sound like the old purchase tax provisions <e> <s> yes i will certainly have a look at it <e>", "<cs> my lords on my noble friends first point <e> <s> about the general drafting and how the section should be set out i have undertaken to look at that <e> <s> my noble friends second point was whether or not subsection of the new section should be expressed negatively or positively <e> <s> whatever the post office act says and how it says it the fact remains that it is already in existence as a generally negative provision <e> <s> therefore it was thought appropriate for the new subsection to start in a positive sense as creating an exception to the general rule in the act <e> <s> but i shall read what my noble friend has said and see whether that requires tightening up <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first of all welcome the reaction to this amendment as an amendment and i very much thank noble lords for what they have said <e> <s> i take the point that it is a very considerable amendment and it does not bear looking at quickly <e> <s> as i understand the position it was tabled last wednesday which should have meant that noble lords had enough time to look at it over the weekend <e> <s> whether or not they did i do not know <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend lord selkirk for his welcome of the amendment <e> <s> i think the noble lord lord ross is making rather heavy weather over the drafting <e> <s> the first part of the amendment arises because of an amendment moved by my noble friend on report he moved it and subsequently withdrew it <e> <s> the object of it was to seek to clarify who was to be entitled to make an application and that is really the crux of the matter <e> <s> your lordships can see from the bill that before i tabled the amendment it was provided that the request had to come from a psychiatrist <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has had two speeches <e> <s> of course it is obvious and the noble lord will see it when he comes to read the <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it is section but my noble friend is right in what he says <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords when i moved that the bill should be read a second time i said that it was not intended to alter the framework or the main thrust of the principal act but to make a number of improvements so that the intentions of that act might be more effectively realised in practice <e> <s> i know that that is not nearly so far as the noble lord lord ross would like to have gone <e> <s> the noble lord has confirmed that this evening <e> <s> nevertheless it was what the government decided to do in the legislative time which we have been given <e> <s> within that context i think that we have so far as your lordships house is <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank noble lords who in the main have welcomed this order <e> <s> to come straight to the various points which were raised i think that one has to remember that the boundary commission had to set about its duties in accordance with a number of rules and while it is true to say that possibly the boundary commissions for scotland and for england and wales have not always interpreted them in exactly the same way i do not think that anyone has seriously suggested that there should be only one boundary commission <e> <s> nevertheless equally i do not think that we should lose sight of the fact that the rules were drawn up by parliament with all-party agreement although in the next breath i agree with the noble lord who said that the rules are capable of a number of different interpretations and there seems in the experience of the present exercise to be a case for clarification <e> <s> however that and possible alterations will be for parliament to decide on or before the time when the boundary commissions next embark on their general review <e>", "<cs> my lords to some appeal <e> <s> i personally do not see anything too bad about some of the new names <e> <s> it may be that carrick cumnock and doon valley does not exactly trip off the tongue but it will be found rather more romantic than some of those little towns if one visits them and not too far away one gets tweeddale ettrick and lauderdale which three members of your lordships house take as their titles <e>", "<cs> my lords dealing with my noble friends first point i have to remind him that so far as increases on spirits are concerned duty levels over the past three years have been relatively low <e> <s> whisky duty is now per cent <e> <s> lower in real terms than in and the real price of whisky is nearly per cent <e> <s> lower than it was in <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the house debated that aspect of the unemployed last friday <e> <s> we have a number of subsidies so far as shipping services and charges to islay are concerned <e> <s> i do not think that the government have plans for going beyond that <e>", "<cs> my lords i bear in mind the points that my noble friend makes <e> <s> his points relate to the governments general economic policy regarding rural areas <e> <s> perhaps one should consider what this government have done for agriculture and moreover for the highlands and islands in the amount of money which has been devoted to the highlands and islands development board <e> <s> the allocation has gone up from million in to million in <e> <s> one can see just how much the government are doing in this direction <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot because my mind is not clever enough to do the percentage sum <e> <s> but i will do it and write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the real reason that the whisky industry finds itself in the difficulties that it is in is the result of the world-wide recession <e> <s> some per cent <e> <s> of whisky which is produced in scotland goes for the export market <e> <s> therefore while i agree that the level of duty has some effect upon demand it is really the recession which has caused the present troubles in the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords the integrated development programme is for the outer isles which i am afraid does not include islay which is not very far from the mainland <e> <s> secondly the plan is already in operation <e> <s> it will last for five years but as i have said i am afraid that islay is outside its scope <e>", "<cs> taken in isolation my lords of course any increase in the price of anything is inflationary <e> <s> but i would hazard a guess that the chancellor has to balance his books and what in this case he has taken with one hand he has given away with another <e>", "<cs> my lords i totally agree with the noble lord lord shinwell <e> <s> whisky is the drink for me especially when compared with foreign muck <e> <s> nevertheless the chancellor has a different road to follow when it comes to raising revenue and i do not believe that the consumers of gin and other such spirits would like to bear the cost of the duty which is raised on whisky if it was ameliorated in that particular direction <e>", "<cs> yes of course my lords and if my noble friend cares to drink malt whisky that will provide even more help and it will do him more good <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it altogether proper that a member of the english bar should intrude when as i understand it the faculty of advocates are losing some of their jurisdiction so far as undefended divorces are concerned therefore i do not seek to do so <e> <s> but on behalf of the government and more especially my noble and learned friend may i say that he has been considerably exercised by the very constructive part which the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey played in the committee stage of the bill and indeed on second reading and that also goes of course for my noble friend lord selkirk and for various other noble and learned lords such as the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside <e> <s> i should like to pay tribute to all those noble lords <e> <s> on behalf of my noble and learned friend i give the undertaking which is sought by the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey <e> <s> i have no doubt that this bill will go a long way to improve the law of scotland so far as this small but important arena is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank both noble lords for their reaction to this statement by my right honourable friend and particularly of course the noble lord lord ross because of his immense professional expertise in this field before he took to politics <e> <s> the noble lord asked me a number of questions <e> <s> the first detailed question was about the three levels <e> <s> as he will know we are imposing a three-level system <e> <s> that means there will be three separate syllabuses for each subject and they will overlap <e> <s> the reason for that is to enable movement between levels <e> <s> i know that fears have been expressed that this system might lead to a form of divisiveness but it has been designed to avoid that because pupils will be able to transfer between levels as their performance merits <e> <s> this means that in the case of one subject a pupil might well be at one level and in the case of another subject he or she might be at a quite different level <e> <s> so i do not think that this will lead to divisiveness as has been feared <e>", "<cs> my lords i tried to explain to the noble lord that so far as the explanations are concerned there will be a circular from my department <e> <s> thereafter it will be up to the schools the teachers within them and the education authorities to make these explanations <e> <s> of course the school teachers will have a key part to play in this matter and it is partly for that reason that there may be facilities for the reduction of a school year in certain instances while these arrangements are being phased in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i understand the noble baroness <e> <s> there have for many years now been falling school rolls in scotland and the levels of teachers which are desirable in any particular instance must reflect the number of children in their area seeking education <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a scottish office matter but i will translate it so to speak into the scottish dimension and write to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are very well aware of the difficulties and indeed my right honourable friend met representatives of scottish racecourses only yesterday <e> <s> he is considering urgently what measures can be taken and i understand he assured the representatives that if legislation is requried it will be pursued as quickly as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right that there are anomalies and they extend beyond racecourses <e> <s> sports grounds including football grounds caravan sites sporting rights reed beds hotels and solar heating systems immediately spring to mind <e> <s> i am not sure that anything is wrong with the method of assessment as such and certainly not regarding the valuers <e> <s> but there are anomalies as i have said which have sprung up particularly in the last few years <e> <s> the government are considering urgently how if these anomalies bear unfairly on the particular subjects we can try to ameliorate the position <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer is yes <e> <s> as i have said the government have become increasingly aware that there are these anomalies which bear very heavily on the particular industries concerned and that is what we are now considering as a matter of urgency <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only repeat to the house that in a matter which is complex in law and not easy to solve so far as fairness is concerned in respect of every class of rateable subject we are doing our best to be as quick as we can <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the way in which this bill has been received by noble lords with the possible exception of the last speaker the noble lord lord rugby but i shall think about what he said while i am on my feet <e> <s> nobody pretends and least of all do i pretend that this bill is other than a fairly modest legislative change <e> <s> certainly nobody pretends that it will lead to a significant increase in the number of farms becoming available to let <e>", "<cs> well my lords i am not going to exchange semantic waffle with the noble lord at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i was reminded while the noble lord was speaking of seeing in yesterdays <e>", "<cs> in order to understand the way in which the clause has been amended one has to read the bill as we had it on second reading with the amendment <e> <s> the difficulty was to enjoin the arbiter to have regard to the four factors which we conceive on lines to of page of the bill and at the same time while he must take an objective test of those factors to disregard the scarcity if it exists of subjects to let in the particular geographical area in which he is working <e> <s> we had it on good advice and this was confirmed by both sides of the industry agreeing that as paragraph <e>", "<cs> neither is the noble lord <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should respond briefly <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross of marnock accuses me of being tetchy last week i think that was his word <e> <s> if i were tetchy it was because the noble lord struck what the americans call a bum note and the sound has not become any clearer over the weekend <e> <s> the reason for the difference between a three-year and a five-year period as opposed to scotland and england was that traditionally farm leases in scotland were longer than those in england <e> <s> therefore it came to be that five years was considered a reasonable period for review whereas in england where they were shorter a shorter period of three years was considered right <e>", "<cs> i would have thought that was not for the government <e>", "<cs> it has nothing to do with the cost of living <e> <s> in the past it has been due to the deplorable attitude shown by the then labour government to the farming community <e> <s> in fact rents bore no relationship to the cost of living except and in so far as the standard of living in agriculture went down because of the appalling policies exhibited by the then minister of agriculture towards the european economic community <e>", "<cs> part i is basically old and part ii is new <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i did not hear that request <e>", "<cs> we went into this

the agreements that they have to accelerate its progress <e> <s> perhaps it is not out of order if i also say that i imagine this will be the last time certainly in this parliament that the noble lord lord ross and i shall face each other across these despatch boxes <e> <s> the last three years or so have been pleasant <e> <s> just occasionally tetchiness has broken out but never for long and it has always been interesting <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by thanking noble lords for their welcome to these estimates and also for the very valuable contributions which every one has made to this debate <e> <s> speaking personally perhaps i might also thank those noble lords who have welcomed me to my new position in the government <e> <s> in many ways it seems a home from home because i am dealing particularly with farmers and their problems in northern ireland <e> <s> before part of my remit was to help deal with the problems of farmers in scotland <e> <s> the danger of course in comparing the apparently similar difficulties is to say that the same geographical isolation the same comparatively harsh climate and <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already told the house of the attitude of the government to the extension of the less favoured areas and any possible funding <e> <s> there is no connection between the two so far as the commission is concerned <e> <s> it is the commissions duty to produce the proposals and it is the duty of the council of ministers to pronounce upon those proposals <e> <s> further than that i cannot and will not go <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank both noble lords for their welcome if that is the right word to this particular order <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill first asked me about article <e> <s> so far as the assembly is

<s> all the provisions under this order are consequential upon the housing order and therefore as a formality i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank both the noble lord lord underhill and the noble lord lord donaldson for their welcome of this statement <e> <s> it is true as i think both noble lords said or implied that not very much can be said until sir james hennessy produces his report <e> <s> as to whether there should he a debate in your lordships house once that report is forthcoming or such parts of it as my right honourable friend feels should be published that will be a matter for the usual channels to discuss in the normal way <e>", "<cs> my lords sir james is devoting his energies to the actual escape which he has been asked to investigate <e> <s> i am quite sure that whatever comes out of his report will be studied with the greatest of care by the prison authorities and insofar as it is applicable will be applied in other prisons <e> <s> i should say to the noble lord lord hunt and he has enormous experience of this that there are no prisons within the united kingdom where we have such a high concentration of violent one could call them vicious prisoners committed to a certain course of conduct <e> <s> therefore it is unlikely that the conditions which pertain at the maze would ever be reproduced in any other prison in great britain <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no information about where these prisoners may have gone <e> <s> however i can tell the noble lord that we have extradition arrangements with a great many countries and if the prisoners are discovered in those countries we will make every effort to have them extradited to this country either on the basis of being escaped prisoners or in respect of the original crimes for which they were convicted <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord underhill and the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge for their welcome to this statement <e> <s> it is quite obvious that feelings of disgust and revulsion are universally shared throughout the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i am sure that all responsible sections of the community in northern ireland and not least the roman catholics will if they have not already done so express their revulsion at what has happened <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very happy to pass on everything that my noble friend has said by way of congratulation <e> <s> in fact only a week ago i went to the forensic science laboratory in the suburbs of belfast and was extremely impressed with what i saw <e> <s> i have no doubt that a word of congratulation should be passed to that organisation and the scientists there <e> <s> i also endorse the other matters which my noble friend mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house agrees that the noble lord lord fitt has neatly and succinctly summed up the situation pointing out not only the difficulties and dangersbut perhaps most important of all that if it were not for the regrettable attitude of some parts of the community then the men of violence could not exist <e> <s> this of course applies on both sides of the sectarian divide <e> <s> so i think that it is up to all those who live in the province and it is certainly up to the government to continue to provide the machinery and the framework which will enable people on each side of the sectarian divide to sink their differences and resort to the ballot box and the debating chamber rather than the bullet <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be convenient now that we get back to a little access to the countryside <e> <s> my first duty is to apologise to the house because i was not in my place at the very moment when this order was called on <e> <s> my second duty is a much more pleasant one <e> <s> it is to congratulate the noble lord lord fitt on his maiden speech <e> <s> i have had the privilege if that is the word of serving if that is the word in ulster only for about six months <e> <s> i have had the pleasure of meeting the noble lord lord fitt on only one occasion which curiously enough was a jubilee dinner in honour of the royal maternity hospital <e> <s> but what i do know is the universal affection with which he is held in all parts of the province <e> <s> that extends to people of every creed and of many different occupations <e> <s> i know that his wise counsels will help your lordships when northern ireland matters fall to be considered in future <e> <s> i too hope that he will not confine himself to northern ireland matters alone but now he has broken his silence that he will weigh in on all sorts of issues <e> <s> i for one shall be very happy to listen to him <e>", "<cs> my lords no doubt the noble lord lord george-brown pulls me up correctly <e> <s> it is necessary to look at the drafting of the order and also to have some regard for historical events in northern ireland actually to understand that when i say that decisions will be taken by a department it is in fact a term of art and springs from those functions which originally were transferred to the old stormont legislature and those which were not <e> <s> those which were were drawn back at the time direct rule was imposed on the province but because of the way in which their legislation has been traditionally <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lords who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> i know that it must be disappointing particularly to the likes of the noble lord lord fitt who has not been a member of your lordships house for too long to see the familiar empty benches when matters pertaining to northern ireland are discussed <e> <s> i have to tell him that when i was in the scottish office there was rather the same effect unless matters were being discussed which would eventually have a british connotation <e> <s> but if we keep our debates sharp and above all if we keep our speeches concise we may by our eloquence attract back into the chamber some noble lords who might otherwise be away for the whole of the dinner hour <e>", "<cs> but jobs are not being destroyed my lords <e> <s> i believe that even the noble lord will agree and unfortunately this is a matter which is occupying many of us today in britain that it is no good keeping people on in overpriced work merely for the sake of keeping them on <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to enter the lists so far as the northern ireland clan are concerned but i very much hope that the clan will use every sort and kind of influence to see to it that these bases or posts are unnecessary by then or at any rate perhaps that they will arrange their i was going to say jollifications their reunion in such a way that they can get by without being too annoyed by the presence of the posts <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft northern ireland emergency provisions act continuance no <e> <s> order which was laid before this house on th november be approved <e> <s> i invite the house to renew for a further period of six months all the provisions of the northern ireland emergency provisions act currently in force <e> <s> i do so at a time when terrorism in the province is never far from the headlines and i am sure your lordships would want me to say something shortly about the current security situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i must thank noble lords who have taken part in this debate and i shall reply briefly <e> <s> the first matter which the noble lord lord underhill raised concerned robberies and the acquisition of funds by paramilitary organisations <e> <s> the royal ulster constabulary has a special squad to deal with this matter <e> <s> i am afraid that it is not known how much money from robberies finds its way into the coffers of terrorists but i would imagine and i do not think that i would be contradicted if i said to the noble lord that it must be considerable <e> <s> of course the answer is to stop the robberies but i am afraid it is part of the very unsatisfactory situation which obtains in the province at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord underhill has asked me three questions <e> <s> the powers of the board in fact will not be materially altered <e> <s> i think the maxim is the greater includes the lesser <e> <s> it is certainly the intention of the government in drafting this legislation to give the new and expanded fcb as it is called the same role as before but possibly to increase it in due course <e> <s> certainly so far as improvement is concerned there is no desire to stop it from doing what it wants in that direction <e> <s> it is of course inhibited by the fact that at the moment it does not have the resources to carry out that role <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank both the noble lords lord underhill and lord donaldson for their restrained if that is the word welcome for this very serious report and particularly the noble lord lord donaldson who has very wide experience of the extraordinary difficulties faced by the prison service in northern ireland on a daily basis difficulties that are quite unparalleled in the rest of the united kingdom <e> <s> one thing that can be said about the report is that although it is an extremely frank document that certainly does not duck any issue it is generous enough to pay tribute where this is due <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord fitt asked me in effect about the inspection of <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the noble lords first point that is the resignation of the governor i fear that a reading of the report will show how that has come about <e> <s> the noble lord is perfectly right to point to the absolutely deplorable fact that no <e>", "<cs> my lords i acknowledge the very difficult job which the prison officers perform in the maze prison and indeed in other prisons in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not privy to the thoughts of the prison officers association <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the noble baroness that prison officers and indeed all who work in the prison service in northern ireland are subjected to pressures which are unknown in the rest of the united kingdom <e> <s> but of course it works both ways <e> <s> the inhabitants of the maze prison consist of a small majority of roman catholics but there are also a very considerable number of protestants there too for the same type of crimes and offences <e> <s> the pressure comes from all sides and from all directions <e> <s> i do not think that one can read too much into the situation other than to provide a prison rgime in which those who are in the prison service can perform their work as free as possible from pressures and unmolested <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to those noble lords who have taken part in the debate on this order <e> <s> there are perhaps one or two matters which call for a reply <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill complained mildly about the timetable <e> <s> i am afraid there is nothing that can be done about that <e> <s> so far as absent voting and the rules appertaining to expenses are concerned it would be nice if all rules which relate to the conducting of elections in every part of the united kingdom could be exactly the same but unfortunately in some cases though not in the case of expenses where the same rules apply they cannot be and that perhaps is the best explanation i can give the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i rather resent being interrupted by the noble lord at inordinate length to tell me in precisely the same terms what he has already told the house <e> <s> it is one thing to pass legislation particularly on a retroactive basis to legitimate what has happened before it is quite another to devise methods which will be effective and at the same time scientifically and legally possible to stop this form of malpractice <e> <s> it is difficult to do this whatever the motivation of those concerned <e> <s> the government are looking at the matter urgently and i hope that these efforts will bear fruit <e> <s> but as i have said not before june <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the draft district electoral areas commissioner northern ireland order which was laid before the house on th december be approved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to noble lords who have welcomed the draft order <e> <s> perhaps i might briefly respond <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill took the very pertinent point that the timetable is tight and in effect he asked <e> <s> why not ask the local government boundaries commissioner to carry out the grouping of wards and in effect extend his jurisdiction <e> <s> the noble lord will recollect that i said in my opening remarks that it was not part of his remit <e> <s> the statutory remit of the local government boundaries commissioner under section of the local government act northern ireland is very specific <e> <s> it makes no provision for the grouping of wards <e> <s> therefore new provision is necessary and this is why the legislation takes the form that it does <e> <s> the noble lord lord hampton asked me about boundaries <e> <s> obviously it would be administratively more convenient if district electoral areas were not split between constituencies where that was possible <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that wigan has now set up a tourist operation could that come within the bounds of this largess <e>", "<cs> my lords i enter this debate with considerable diffidence partly because the bill has ground its way through two houses at considerable length before i have come to it and secondly because this is my first foray since resuming my seat on the back-benches and i am not sure that this is the kind of bill that i would normally have chosen <e> <s> nevertheless i would say a word less elegantly than the noble lord lord mishcon and i hope at a little less length in support of what he said <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down for my own information would he not agree that it is not the character of the woman that is really the subject of debate but the quality of the invitation issued by the man <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble earl lord perth on giving us the opportunity of discussing a number of matters both of fascination and import <e> <s> if i have a criticism of this motion it is that it is so widely aimed that it could have encompassed a number of interesting and important scottish matters <e> <s> i should love to have worn my scottish hat and talked about a transport policy for scotland i should love to have talked about an integrated land-use policy which does not exist and never has existed in scotland and i should love to have talked about the regeneration of industry with the right amount of encouragement but i shall not <e>"]
