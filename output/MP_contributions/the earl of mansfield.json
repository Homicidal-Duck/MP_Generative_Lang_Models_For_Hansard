["<cs> my lords my recollection is and i have not been able to look it up in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always ready to look <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> does he know how far it is from tynecastle to murrayfield <e> <s> would he agree with me that it is about yards and that the supporters might be expected to walk between the two <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has had his point explained perfectly adequately by my noble friend lord lyell <e> <s> as regards the present situation no further powers are required in relation to railway police <e> <s> that is my first point <e> <s> my second point is that various departments are as it were in consultation <e> <s> i do not think that my noble friend can go further than say as he has that the object of the exercise is to bring forth a by-law which will i hope be comprehensive and commendable <e> <s> it would be quite impossible for any of us to say at this stage how long it will take the draftsmen to put the thoughts on to paper and thereafter to produce a satisfactory by-law <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey i shall address myself only to the two amendments nos <e> <s> and at this stage <e> <s> when i saw the list of amendments to start with i formed the unworthy thought that perhaps the noble and learned lord lord wilson of lang-side was trying as it were to have his cake and eat it <e> <s> but i am sure that cannot be so and i therefore discuss these two amendments on the basis that he is a sinner come to repentance that the wise words which fell from my lips in committee when we discussed this matter at considerable length have had their effect on the noble and learned lord as well as the various researches which he has obviously made and which i shall not deal with at any further length and i discuss these two amendments on their merits <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give the noble and learned lord that assurance now <e> <s> the word replaced should be taken as having its normal english meaning or what i consider to be its normal english meaning <e> <s> there is no question of repealing or replacing in the other sense any of the existing common law <e>", "<cs> my lords i must congratulate noble lords opposite on having done their homework <e> <s> some went back quite a long way <e> <s> to deal with the noble and learned lord who has gone back least far if i am guilty of misleading the house in relation to the reply i gave to the noble lord lord mishcon i crave <e>", "<cs> my lords i am bound to say i do not know whether it was a cockney who actually drafted this <e> <s> i do not think we have many in the scottish office but i will look up this point <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend not only has expertisehe has experience and if he confesses that he is either perplexed or even worse bemused who am i to contradict him <e> <s> i do not know whether the effect of my noble friends remarks was what i might call a <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> this is a matter which the draftsmen will have to consider in the light of my noble friends remarks <e> <s> i am certainly not competent to deal with it at this moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly take very seriously the constructive remarks of my noble friend <e> <s> of course other departments have different ways of going about matters but so far as the scottish office is concerned when we have any bill like this again i am sure that something on the lines that my noble friend has suggested will be more than welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall bring to my right honourable friends attention my noble friends request that he should himself pay a visit <e> <s> perhaps i may say with regard to the alternative site at tweedbank that there is insufficient land available there for a major hospital project <e> <s> in any event it is the policy of the borders regional council to develop tweedbank for housing and industry as a means of retaining population in the central borders and encouraging population growth in the longer term <e> <s> the fact that the site which has been chosen is in an area designated as of great landscape value does not of course preclude development <e> <s> great care has been taken over the positioning and the design of buildings within the site <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the scheme is not yet under way in the physical sense <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give my noble friend that assurance <e> <s> the views of the commission have already been considered by the local authorities concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not armed with that information <e> <s> perhaps i may write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i am trying to do some sums <e> <s> i am not finding it very easy at am <e> <s> the draft scheme <e>", "<cs> i am on my feet <e> <s> i am trying to think <e> <s> perhaps <e>", "<cs> with the indulgence of the committee i will answer because my noble friend was good enough to tell me about it and i had it looked up <e> <s> section of the education milk act limits an authoritys power to provide milk for children at non-maintained schools to children at special schools and to other children under eight years <e> <s> clause of the bill simply removes that limitation restoring the position to that in section of the act as amended leaving authorities free to supply milk meals and so on to non-maintained schools as they think appropriate <e> <s> there is at present no duty to provide milk at non-maintained special schools <e> <s> the power of authorities to do so is not affected by this clause so that the words which the amendment proposed to leave out are in any case only consequential on the substance of the provision in the preceding words of the subsection <e> <s> i hope that meets his point <e>", "<cs> i shall not follow the noble lord lord ross down the highways and byways of the highlands and islands but <e>", "<cs> stick to a pre-breakfast remark or two <e> <s> i start with this premise that we on this side consider that it is indefensible in the present economic situation to spend hundreds of millions of pounds on a subsidy to school meals most of which goes to families who are in no need of such a subsidy <e> <s> if i may come from that straight to scotland the low demand for school meals in scotland shows that the present type of meal is far from popular and is unwanted <e> <s> fewer than half of the pupils presently take the meal at all and fewer than one-third are prepared to pay for it <e> <s> on the other hand there is evidence of an unsatisfied demand especially in secondary schools for a more informal type of snack school meal such as is proposed in the bill <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord lord galpern does not understand why there is need for economy in this country far be it from me to turn this into an economic debate <e> <s> of course there will be economies made and in a moment i shall come to the scale of them <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has made an intervention <e> <s> he will have the right to speak in a few minutes and no doubt will do so and tear me to pieces <e> <s> the next matter relates to the difference in the dependence of rural families on school transport in comparison with their counterparts in the urban areas <e> <s> again there has been a certain amount of misunderstanding <e> <s> on friday my noble friend the duke of norfolk spoke on the radio programme today day when normally i have the sod of scotland under my feet but because i was working this bill was unable to do so <e> <s> the noble duke said in effect that urban people do not have to pay anything at all <e> <s> many speakers in this debate have exposed the fallacy of that point of view <e> <s> in some cases they may have to pay very much more than the urban dweller <e> <s> therefore the reality is rather different <e>", "<cs> unless they arc travelling to a designated football ground i do not think that whisky comes into the matter <e> <s> we have had quite enough of that <e> <s> whisky or no i do not believe especially in a rural community and in the rural community that i inhabit that a harsh and unconscionable view will be taken of a child who does not have his money or his pass <e> <s> my noble friend lord ridley spoke i was about to say from the grassroots of the local authorities but to say that would be very rude he spoke from the pinnacle of the local authorities <e> <s> the local authorities will no doubt give guidance to the operators on how such matters arc to be dealt with and i should have thought we could have left that to their good sense <e>", "<cs> if i may interrupt the noble viscount it will be appreciated that because of the intervening amendment i could not rise to my feet <e> <s> it had to be dealt with <e> <s> the committee have clearly come to a decision as to what they consider to be right and proper so far as the last clause dealing with the question of school transport was concerned <e> <s> in the circumstances and one rejoices if one may that the house of lords is able to take an independent view of the government of the day the government do not think that it would be either profitable or proper to continue the debate on that part of the bill which applies to scotland <e> <s> i suggest therefore that the matter is now put <e> <s> perhaps the noble viscount and others who had given notice of their intention to move amendments would not do so <e> <s> we can then come to the end of the clause <e>", "<cs> since the noble lord lord ross of marnock has intimated that he does not intend to divide the committee on this matter i can leave out of my speech some of the more ebullient remarks to which i might have given vent but they will come again they will keep <e> <s> i confirm what the noble lord has said in scotland the law has been widely understood and perfectly appreciated by the local authorities and i believe that the figures speak for themselves in this matter as to the seriousness with which they have considered and sought to carry out their role in this direction <e>"]
