["<cs> my lords i suspect that it is an awesome task for almost anyone to address your lordships for the first time <e> <s> it is certainly particularly so for a mere barrister to address your lordships when almost every other speaker in this debate is a present or a past lord chancellor or lord of appeal in ordinary and perhaps even more so when the mover of the bill is the noble and learned lord lord scarman at whose feet i had the privilege to start my legal career <e> <s> i hope therefore that the house will be even more indulgent than usual to me <e>", "<cs> i too wish to commend this amendment to your lordships <e> <s> i speak as one who lives on the very edge of the forest of dean and whose family have lived there for something more than years whose father and grandfather and more remote ancestors i believe have all been verderers of the forest <e>", "<cs> the treasury solicitor is suggested but as a practising barrister it would hardly be suitable for me to make critical remarks of that from where my work might come <e> <s> the forest of dean is a place where history combines with beauty to produce a unique national possession <e> <s> that must surely not be imperilled for the convenience of parliamentary draftsmen or the treasury solicitor <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i add a word of thanks to the noble and learned lord lord scarman for asking this unstarred question <e> <s> secondly may i thank the select committee of your lordships house and sir charles sopwith for their report on this not only complex but perhaps rather arid subject <e>", "<cs> my lords notwithstanding the superb exposition of the bill by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor it is i think plain that this is not a very apt bill on which to make a second reading speech <e> <s> on the question of jurisdiction with which i am concerned the only general principle in the bill is that there should be uniform rules allocating jurisdiction between the member states <e> <s> we are committed to that principle by membership of the community and i do not seek to challenge it or even to discuss it <e>", "<cs> i shall happily call it a <e>", "<cs> as these amendments go at least part of the way towards solving the problem which i raised at second reading may i say how grateful i am to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for giving the matter his attention and for going at least this far to help <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister enlighten me and the house on subsection <e>", "<cs> may i respectfully suggest that neither the amendment nor the ministers answer solves the problem <e> <s> what it says is that a data subject shall be entitled to these things <e> <s> if one is not on the file at all one is not a data subject <e> <s> therefore if i suspect i am on the computer and i say please tell me whether you hold anything about me and if so what <e> <s> and you do not answer because i am not on the computer i may go on for years being convinced i am on your computer never being able to find out that i am not and you committing no offence or offending no principle by not answering me <e> <s> it is only if i am on the computer that i fall within the definition of a data subject <e>", "<cs> may i seek guidance from the minister <e> <s> at the moment the registrar has discretion to refuse an application if he is satisfied that the applicant is likely to contravene the principles <e> <s> under the amendment he will be bound to refuse it <e> <s> can the minister give me an example where it will be appropriate for the registrar to be satisfied that the applicant was likely to contravene the principles but none the less to register him <e> <s> surely it must be inconceivable that he should be satisfied that the principles are going to be broken but none the less grant him registration <e>", "<cs> i am suggesting that it would be wholly wrong as the clause now stands for the registrar to have power although satisfied that the applicant was likely to contravene the principles none the less to grant registration <e> <s> that is what the clause says at the moment unless this amendment is passed <e> <s> i should like the noble lord to give me an example of where the registrar should grant registration to an applicant who was likely to contravene the principles <e>", "<cs> may i ask about the relationship of subsections and <e> <s> as i understand it if an enforcement notice is served and one gives notice of appeal then one is not obliged under subsection to do anything until the appeal has been determined <e> <s> but under subsection the registrar can if he thinks it important enough and urgent require steps to be taken notwithstanding that an appeal is pending <e> <s> is there any provision by which one can appeal against that requirement itself or has the registrar total power to say this is a matter or urgency <e> <s> you must comply although you have an appeal pending <e> <s> perhaps there will be no one to whom one can go to ask for a revision of that and therefore one has to comply and then have the appeal some time later <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> he may be saying that it is unreasonable to be required to do it that quickly or he may say that he has such a good appeal pending that it is unreasonable for that reason to make him do it immediately <e> <s> i am asking whether there is any way in which he can challenge the registrars issue of what one might call an urgency notice <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord mishcon speaks i should like to seek some enlightenment about amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i had understood that because it referred to the secretary of state it provided that all exemption certificates would be given by the specific secretary of state in charge of all these functions namely i imagine the home secretary <e> <s> when the noble lord lord elton spoke to the amendment he assumed that even if these words were included the particular secretary of state in the department concerned would give the exemption certificates and pointed out that there were some departments which did not have a secretary of state <e> <s> i must confess that i was attracted to this amendment by the theory that all certificates of exemption would be given by one person and that therefore the practices of the varying departments would be standardised and one would not have for example one department that claimed that everything was national security and another department that took a more realistic view but there would be a central and informed view addressed to the matter <e> <s> i would like to know from the noble lord lord mishcon and from the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones which of these they intended <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for that answer albeit i confess that i find it unsatisfactory <e> <s> i am sure that the amendment may not achieve the whole purpose but as he said the whole purpose could be achieved if one wanted to do so <e> <s> of course as regards the ordinary manila file which merely records the date of ones payment it does not matter whether or not you can get to it <e> <s> but my worry and i suggest that it should be a worry of this house is when the symbol on the file means this chap is in the dirt book and is therefore dirty <e> <s> do not touch him <e> <s> surely if that is on a computer and can be flashed around the the world it does not matter that what lies behind it cannot be flashed around the world <e> <s> but if that can be flashed around the world and is available to anybody at the press of a button then the subject in question ought to have the right to see it and it ought to be properly controlled <e> <s> that is the whole purpose of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also express my gratitude to the noble lord for dealing with this point and indeed for the care he took in dealing with all the points i raised <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us whether it would be possible to instal on the m itself and on the major roads leading to it electronic notices which give up-to-date i emphsise up-todate information as to the periods of delay when there are considerable hold-ups <e> <s> is the minister aware that there are very many users who given that information well back from the bridge could divert <e>", "<cs> my lords at the risk of being labelled the noble earls th lawyer may i say that in my view as a lawyer the word substantial is a great deal clearer than appreciable <e> <s> substantial is a concept very well known to law while appreciable i imagine would be very difficult <e> <s> if appreciable was as it might well be held to be to mean anything other than minimal one would be landing arbitrators with the enormous task of trying to give a to per cent <e> <s> discount on other rents because there was an appreciable scarcity albeit not a substantial scarcity <e> <s> i believe that substantial would be clearer and would make the arbitrators task a great deal easier <e>", "<cs> my lords i start by joining all other members of the committee who have spoken in expressing both our gratitude to the noble viscount lord rochdale for chairing the committee so ably and best wishes for his speedy recovery <e>", "<cs> i am somewhat surprised that the noble and learned lord lord denning who spoke immediately after the noble baroness lady robson did not correct what i venture to suggest was a serious legal fallacy in her thesis <e> <s> as i understood it her thesis was that a farmer who breaks the regulations for example by selling milk which has come from a cow which has just had antibiotics for mastitis can be prosecuted but is not liable to the individual who consumes that milk and becomes ill with the greatest respect to the noble baroness that is legal rubbish <e> <s> there is the law of negligence <e> <s> if a farmer has broken regulations designed for the safety of the public that is the clearest possible evidence of negligence and that farmer would go down and have to pay compensation under the law as it now stands <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord lord denning sought to discourage the committee from accepting the amendment on the grounds that it was contrary to some principle of english law to have a look at insurance on a matter of this kind <e> <s> he said that english law had never had regard to insurance in any question of assessment of damages <e> <s> with the greatest of respect to the noble and learned lord for whom i have also the greatest affection it is not a question of assessment of damages it is a question of the imposition of a new form of liability <e>", "<cs> my lords having heard the exposition of the noble and learned lord lord edmund-davies of <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord said that it was not his intention in the drafting to avoid the possibility of judicial review <e> <s> speaking for myself i have no possible hesitation in accepting that <e> <s> whether or not it was perhaps in the back of the minds of those in the department of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor who drafted some parts of this bill before his welcome elevation to this post we cannot know <e> <s> but assuming that it is not so intended i confess that i am wholly unable to understand why the government are in any way reluctant to accept the amendment which states that they shall be obliged to have regard to these matters rather than that they shall be entitled to have regard to these matters <e> <s> as i understand it the part of amendment no <e> <s> which we are now considering states that the government shall <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i should also like to support the amendment <e> <s> i confess that i am not sure that it really is as unworrying a point as the noble lord <e> <s> lord airedale suggested <e> <s> i confess to not being aware of any other statute which appears to suggest that a court may draw inferences as it sees fit <e> <s> if one were to have such a provision in this statute i venture to suggest there is a risk that the court might think that somethng new and novel was meant and therefore might think that it had a greater liberty to draw inferences or to draw inferences without evidence other than in the normal way <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise not to express any view on the merits or demerits of summer time but to pursue somewhat further the last point mentioned by the noble lord lord mishcon namely the powers or <e>", "<cs> my lords the recent answer of the noble lord lord mishcon was not adequate <e> <s> what he has described in the amendment as mail order is not mail order <e> <s> he said that the answer to the objection made was that the man wrote in first <e> <s> let us suppose that my perfectly normal gun dealer sends me this years price list an offer communicated by the postal services <e> <s> i am about to order a gun <e> <s> i see that the dealer is quoting a favourable price and that is what i want but he tells me that there would be an offence <e> <s> it all depends on whether i wrote in first or whether the price list arrived at my house the day before <e> <s> i cannot believe that the noble lord means to apply a prohibition whenever one receives from ones normal gun merchant his standard price list for ammunition included along with firearms <e>", "<cs> my lords i venture to rise as a humble practitioner to try to inject an element of practicality and reality into this rarefied atmosphere <e> <s> i venture to think that some of your learned lordships have forgotten what it is like to be in real practice <e> <s> of course i accept that there are rare cases in the highest courts where reference to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a practising barrister <e> <s> i make that declaration although i think that most other members of the bar who have spoken in your lordships house today have not felt it necessary to declare such an interest <e> <s> that may be because unlike me they are so well-known as to render such a declaration unnecessary or it may be because like me they believe that the green paper proposals will not adversely affect those who are presently i emphasise the word presently practising at the bar <e>", "<cs> equally on the other hand the bar will not want to try to subject itself incompetently and uncomfortably to the disciplines and restrictions of life in a firm <e> <s> that is why i said at the outset that i do not regard these proposals as a threat to those presently at the bar <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be that having risen to the dizzy heights at the top of his firm the solicitor equivalent of the noble lord lord alexander will wish to spread wings and go back to a very small specialised bar with two chambers of mega-silks who are so successful that even the largest city firm can no longer contain them <e> <s> fifteen mega-silks of that kind if one can conceive of lord alexanders is one thing but it is not an independent bar <e> <s> it does not provide the thing that is really going to do the damage if the bar goes which is that it will kill middle-sized firms of solicitors which cannot afford to have a full team of <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may join in expressing gratitude for and appreciation of the efforts of the clerk advisers and staff of the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords at the committee stage the noble lord lord carter declared an interest on the grounds that he was or was associated with a landowner who wished to provide land for one of these low cost housing schemes <e> <s> it seems to me a little curious to declare an interest in the sense that one wishes to give away something for less than its value but in so far as that is an interest to declare i likewise declare it <e> <s> i also have been actively seeking to pursue a low cost housing scheme in our village from land that i am very willing virtually to give away provided that the situation and the conditions are such that it can remain within the community <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may ask this <e> <s> he has referred to a decision of the country landowners association <e> <s> if tomorrow at its council meeting the association reverses that decision will the minister undertake that on third reading the government will support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is that correct <e> <s> the amendment which has just been carried applies only to houses which have already been built whereas the amendment moved by the noble lord lord vinson would apply to houses constructed in the future <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment and in particular the portion of it which deals with the hearing of cases on subsequent consecutive days <e> <s> cases can run over into a second or further day either because they were obviously going to do so from the first or because as the noble and learned lord lord ackner pointed out they do not come on although they are expected to at am <e> <s> there may be other reasons <e> <s> they may go more slowly than expected because the advocate is not very good or because the judge talks too much <e> <s> cases can run over for a large number of reasons <e>", "<cs> i should like to inquire of those moving the amendment whether they are perhaps not inadvertently making a change in the substantive rather than the procedural law <e> <s> as i understand it and i do not understand it the procedure at present is that one can challenge such decisions only by judicial review <e> <s> that means that one cannot challenge the merits of the decision one can only say that procedurally it has gone wrong or that no reasonable housing committee could have come to the decision in question <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble and learned lord that may be the case <e> <s> however if a way is new but is not better there is no point in having it <e> <s> surely it must be new and better <e> <s> i think that the noble and learned lord lord hailsham went a little too far in saying that if a way is new it must be worse <e> <s> however there is a justification for that on the words which are sought to be amended that it should be new without the need to demonstrate that it should also be better <e> <s> why do we go only to novelty if there will not also be an improvement <e>", "<cs> may i reply to the point made by the noble lord lord mishcon that if a solicitor advocate would not take a point that or is different from and it might demonstrate that the solicitor advocate ought not to take points in the high court <e>", "<cs> this amendment and the amendment tabled by the noble lord lord mishcon would achieve wholly different objectives <e> <s> the amendment tabled by the noble lord lord mishcon <e>", "<cs> my lords the speeches of those opposing this matter seem to have failed to take into account the revised words of the amendment as now proposed <e> <s> the amendment expressly states the principle that the advocate practising in a superior court is under a duty to act except in circumstances in which it would be unreasonable to require him to do so <e> <s> the noble lord lord boardman said that solicitors are in a different position because they are in partnership <e> <s> the rules will be able to cover that <e> <s> if one of the partners is acting for the other side it will almost certainly be thought that it would not be reasonable to require him to act against his partner <e>", "<cs> my lords insofar as the solicitor will undertake conventional solicitor work his freedom to pick and choose is not being affected <e> <s> it is only the question of whether he or some other partner in his firm or some other partner in some other firm of solicitors will undertake the advocacy <e> <s> therefore the question of coming off the street has nothing to do with advocacy <e> <s> those circumstances relate to the preparatory work not to the brief <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the exchange that took place between the noble and learned lord and the noble lord lord mishcon before either sat down on the last occasion demonstrates plainly that this amendment is right <e> <s> existing rules should survive unless it is plain that they are wrong <e> <s> as the provision stands only one of the designated judges has to have some doubt and the existing rule goes because they shall be deemed not to be so approved unless the lord chancellor and each of the designated judges is positively satisfied that it is right <e> <s> surely that puts the onus entirely the wrong way <e> <s> one should strike down an existing rule only if everyone is convinced that it is bad <e> <s> that would be the effect of the amendment of the noble lord lord meston and i venture to suggest that it is right <e>", "<cs> my lords what then happens if one designated judge does not like an existing rule and all the rest of them like it <e> <s> that means neither the existing rule is approved nor can any other rule be approved because the other designated judges think the rule should stand as it is <e> <s> the bar or the law society has existing rights of audience and there is no rule at all governing some important aspects of the matter <e> <s> surely it should be right that all the rules stand unless and until this body unanimously disapproves a rule so that something has to be put in its place <e>"]
