association any corporate plan or even to say that the directors of a company should do so year-in year-out <e> <s> this must be considered on the exigencies of even the day-to-day decisions of the directors and it is certainly not the function of the articles of association to be used in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper

president of the court of session lord clyde in a leading case stated that <e>", "<cs> my lords first it is my great pleasure to congratulate if i may with the greatest respect my noble friend lord

would my noble friend be good enough to let me know whether her majestys government will be expressing to the government of his majesty the king of spain their gratitude for the very moving expressions of sympathy by the people of tenerife as a result of this disaster <e>", "<cs> my lords in investigating this subject i have found the legal and historical background underlying the creation of the post office monopoly of telecommunications not only fascinating <e>", "<cs> i believe that this amendment is singularly lacking in common sense <e> <s> anyone who allows his car to be used or who shares his car will make absolutely certain that he will not have a whole gang of people jammed into the back of the car with all the damage that might ensue from that <e> <s> i would suggest that for legislation to be introduced on a point like this brings it into serious disrepute <e> <s> the eminent common sense of most people in these circumstances is quite adequate to handle this problem <e>", "<cs> i speak as a somewhat indifferent accountant on this amendment <e> <s> i believe that this amendment flies in the face of reality because the test of profit among other things is indeed almost beyond the measure of an accountant let alone anybody else <e> <s> who is going to measure this element of profit anyway <e> <s> primarily on the grounds of necessity this amendment should fail <e>", "<cs> the noble lord did not say or even suggest really that the established services would be damaged he said that they may be damaged <e> <s> does he have any doubt on this particular issue <e>", "<cs> while i have a certain amount of sympathy for the noble lord lord mishcon i am sure that he will draw great comfort and indeed entertainment if he reads lord bellwins speech on second reading <e> <s> if i remember rightly he made very clear a consolidating measure regarding public service vehicles was in train <e> <s> this will help the first point that was made

regard to the interests of the public <e> <s> i should have thought that that was quite clear <e> <s> what this amendment as drafted is seeking to do is to place a statutory duty upon the traffic commissioners to consider the likely effect on the public <e> <s> in other words they are making it a statutory duty to soothsay or to crystal-gaze on the effect it will have on the public and as a test i do not think that that is the least bit reasonable <e>", "<cs> i put my name to this amendment because i felt a certain amount of sympathy for it but having heard my noble friend the ministers sweet reason on this i must confess that i am totally and completely swung round <e> <s> on reflection i really misunderstood the point underlying this part of the bill <e> <s> i am very much obliged for his clarification <e>", "<cs> there is just one circumstance that i can see in which it definitely would not be in the interests of the public if the applicant should apply for a service where there is no service in existence <e> <s> that is a service which would undoubtedly be a loss-making one and would have to draw upon public funds <e> <s> the traffic commissioners would have to weigh up that balance and they might well come to the conclusion that it would be against the interests of the public to draw upon public funds in those circumstances <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord lord underhill hit the nail on the head when he referred to the number of actions in the high court which attempted to define what occasion meant which is the word used in the previous legislation <e> <s> for that reason i rather welcome the word event <e> <s> i am not a lawyer i may have got this absolutely wrong but i think the test of what an occasion is is a subjective test namely what is an occasion to one person may not be an occasion to another person <e> <s> but an event is a question of fact the test for deciding what an event is would presumably be one of reasonableness and it is perfectly capable of legal tests <e> <s> in that respect i think the use of the word event should be welcomed rather than not and i am looking forward to lord mishcon knocking me about on this one <e>", "<cs> that is very much a subjective test and it is purely a question of fact whether i would welcome it <e>", "<cs> may i ask whether there was any reason why they changed the test from occasion to events <e> <s> i think it would be most helpful to this committee to know <e> <s> i am not suggesting that there is anything sinister about it <e> <s> i would very much like to know for my own purposes the reason why they changed the test of occasion to event <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend responds i may be completely wrong but i believe that in law the traffic commissioners are an office and not persons <e>", "<cs> i rise to support my noble friend and indeed noble lords opposite on this particular amendment <e> <s> i believe that it would be an improvement to the bill <e> <s> i do not wish to repeat the argument but i should like to raise one particular matter which i believe is important <e> <s> it may be argued that with permanent licences there will be more variation of licences and less income from licensing fees which at present cover the traffic commissioners costs when dealing with variations <e> <s> that is true and it was considered whether or not there should be reference in the proposed clause to fees for variations of licences <e> <s> this was not done because it was considered that it would be out of keeping with the general practice in this respect <e>", "<cs> i wish to make a small comment on the amendment <e> <s> i see the necessity for using the phrase proposed to be used under because if noble lords look at subsection they will see it is quite clear that the future tense is used throughout the subsection <e> <s> the subsection starts <e>", "<cs> before my friend resumes perhaps i could point out that there is no amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it has been withdrawn <e>", "<cs> i rise to support my noble friend lord teviot <e> <s> as i am sure my noble friend lord bellwin is aware this is an attempt at clarification <e> <s> it has no object other than that <e> <s> i am sure that he will be as sympathetic to this amendment as he has been to the previous amendments standing in my name <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree <e>", "<cs> i can see a practical problem with this amendment <e> <s> if the traffic commissioners were to hear a case on friday and if it happened to be a bank holiday weekend it would not leave very much time for the applicant to make his application to the minister <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> in the light of his remarks i am most happy to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> i rise to support this amendment but i am in need of clarification with regard to subsection c <e> <s> it appears from the wording of this subsection that there is a presumption in scottish law that if anyone becomes incapable of managing his business affairs he must necessarily be a lunatic <e> <s> i may <e>", "<cs> all that i would say to that is god forbid <e>", "<cs> may i ask a question regarding the amendment to clause <e> <s> the amendment inserts the definition of modification and reads <e>", "<cs> i rise to support my noble friend on this point <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon showed a certain fear for putative shareholders but it is worth saying that any future shareholder <e>", "<cs> i cannot help feeling that the noble lord lord mishcon is inadvertently misleading himself on this amendment when he refers merely to retaining voting power in the successor company <e> <s> surely the voting power is the power when it comes to considering a company <e> <s> to try to divide the voting power in terms of say the rights of interest in profits or capital interest is not possible because those who have the voting power can always vote away the financial interests be it by way of profits dividend or capital interest of the future shareholders <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am very grateful to the noble lord lord ritchie-calder for raising this very timely subject <e> <s> unlike other noble lords i shall not be speaking of the little birds and the little fishes <e> <s> i shall be speaking of another much more important animal namely man <e> <s> i intend

a very nice irony for the noble lord lord mccarthy on more than one occasion when referring to the vocal minority in a union no doubt reflecting the views of the non-vocal majority should use a term which is so often used by his colleagues in the soviet union namely the vocal dissidents <e> <s> i think this is the key to the whole attitude of the noble lord opposite in that what the executives of unions really do fear is the voice of the rank and file <e>", "<cs> my lords if i recall correctly what was said at the committee stage and i think this is important this particular bill changes the word occasion and sets a new test of event <e> <s> i must confess that i rather welcome this because as the noble lord lord mishcon said at the committee stage there have been a considerable number of cases in the high court in order to determine what is a special occasion <e> <s> as i understand it the reason why this is a very difficult test indeed is that occasion is very much a subjective test as opposed to an event which i take to be a more objective test <e> <s> for that reason i prefer the word event <e> <s> but in any case the person who is going to decide whether it is a special occasion or event is one of the traffic commissioners <e> <s> i feel that this amendment is not necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords following what the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran said it is important to remember that fundamentally this experiment is to be in a trial area and the whole object of a trial is to learn <e> <s> unless there is a criss-cross of information between operators in all sectors and indeed with the public in a trial area no one will learn anything from the trial <e> <s> i have certain doubts about making it a statutory duty on operators to disseminate information one to the other <e> <s> i believe it is of vital importance that people should be encouraged to swap information and experience within the period of the trial <e>", "<cs> my lords it is plain to me that the draftsmen have fought gallantly to keep that phrase within the bill <e> <s> in the light of that explanation for which i thank my noble friend and from which i have learned a great deal i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the argument of the noble lord lord mishcon really has considerable merit <e> <s> there is only one flaw as i see it in the way the amendment is drafted which is that if one has a time limit specified within the bill be it or days and i believe that the first amendment should have a different time limit from the second amendment because of the different circumstances then the words as soon as is practicable become unnecessary <e> <s> from a drafting point of view i believe it might be better if those words were taken out and an actual time limit set into the clause <e> <s> if my noble friend lord bellwin would consider that point in his answer i should be very much obliged <e>", "<cs> my lords i am puzzled by my noble friends amendment <e> <s> as i understand it any bus company is perfectly free to dress up their conductors in the uniforms of ss generals if they want to and i cannot really understand why the licensing of bus conductors necessarily affects the dress that he wears <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel i must clarify one point which to me is extremely important <e> <s> at no time did the noble lord

turkey are of strategic importance particularly bearing in mind that they are made for only two hours per week as opposed to two and a half hours a week to greece <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like

friend for that answer <e> <s> while i assume that my noble friend agrees with his right honourable friend when she stated the other day that we will be able to reduce the interest rate when fewer

expensively exhorting people and particularly the young to pledge their credit as hard as they can go bearing in mind the unfortunate economic and social ills that must flow from that practice <e>",

set of objectives set for the civil aviation authority and in particular those objectives in respect of the environment <e> <s> by virtue of section of the civil aviation act the authority has the

<e>", "<cs> as i see it the bodies and descriptions of bodies mentioned in the new clause proposed by my noble and learned friend lord mackay of clashfern are those aspects of local authorities which are fundamentally running a business and it is for this reason that the road passenger transport undertakings of local authorities should in my untutored view certainly be encapsulated in this particular new clause <e> <s> i do not think that the analogy drawn by my noble friend lord sandford of an education service is quite in the same category as that of running a transport service which

discourage cross-subsidisation <e> <s> this is the fundamental reason for tabling this amendment <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> in the light of that explanation i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend and i am sure that the whole committee is for that explanation <e> <s> accordingly i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i accept the point that it was almost certainly a printing error <e> <s> however it resulted in a substantive change in the meaning of the clause and as i pointed the fact out to the department in november i feel

an obvious printing or spelling error one does not want to waste parliamentary time but where the issue involves a totally different word we should be careful not to create a precedent <e> <s> however in view of my noble friends explanation i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend for that full and detailed explanation and if i may say so the explanations appear to be getting better and better <e> <s> i hope that he maintains the same standard throughout the proceedings on the bill <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs>

exercise its powers to meet the social industrial and commercial needs of the british islands to a duty to have regard to must be an immense improvement <e> <s> under the stonehouse act it was virtually a piece of declaratory law which could not possibly be met by anybody let alone british telecommunications <e> <s> in a strict interpretation of the general duty as defined under the stonehouse act the post office as it was then manifestly failed in that duty <e> <s> how can they possibly meet the social industrial and commercial needs of this country <e>", "<cs> that is precisely the same wording as the act and indeed the bill <e> <s> i had indeed read it <e> <s> by switching the duty that is a change <e>", "<cs> in principle i support the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> i find it very puzzling that by virtue of clause on page of the bill an obligation of secrecy should be placed upon the corporation or indeed upon any person in the course of providing the service under this part of the bill but that this is only with regard to the provision of data processing services or services connected therewith <e> <s> as i understand it although i may be quite wrong the amendment of the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran would cover the provision of telephone services which it is a specific duty to provide under clause <e> <s> i find it rather odd too concerning the obligation of secrecy which is sanctioned in clause that hideous penalties for contravention of imprisonment and fines should come about only when the person who abuses this information does so without the consent of the other <e> <s> however i believe that this should be discussed when we reach that particular stage <e>", "<cs> i find it very useful that my noble friend lord trefgarne should have told us of the various provisions scattered all over the statute book for over years with regard to the various offences that people can be charged with <e> <s> they can be charged with invading privacy on the pstn <e> <s> but would it be possible to gather these together and bring them within the body of the bill say into clause so that we know at least what penalties exist in the statute and repeal those provisions in the original statute so that it is quite clear for the public to see where the whole issue of the obligation of secrecy stands <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged for that explanation which certainly clarifies what i laughingly describe as my mind <e> <s> in the light of that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for his comprehensive explanation in rebuttal to the amendment <e> <s> i wish in particular to pay tribute to my noble friend lord swinfen for the valuable point he made which i had neither the wit nor understanding to consider and arising out of that the minister may be able to assist me by answering a question <e> <s> let us suppose that a telephone engineer were to install a telephone and

uses the term <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend for what he has said and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have listened with very great care indeed to my noble

good idea indeed to me <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very much obliged to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran for his assistance and i am comforted by the knowledge that my noble friend will come to this point at a later date <e> <s> however at this stage i must say that i was astonished to hear him say that the amendment would in any way weaken the provisions of clause in particular subsection <e>", "<cs> i defer to that my noble friend is almost certainly right though i should be much obliged to hear detailed argument in that respect <e> <s> notwithstanding that point i consider that my noble friend did me a slight unfairness by suggesting that i did not raise the point that the granting to british telecommunications of special or exclusive rights or

be vigourously opposed <e> <s> it runs to the very philosophy of the bill and although these powers may appear swingeing they are in my view very necessary <e> <s> in arguing the case the noble lord

industrial future of this country should be in the hands of a public trading corporation <e>", "<cs> i have the misfortune totally to disagree with my noble friend lord de la warr <e> <s> i believe that <e>", "<cs> i hope that the government will look at this amendment with very great care <e> <s> i support it in its entirety for two very good reasons it is directly in line with the expressed intentions and views of the secretary of state for industry in his statement on th april when he said that british telecommunications should be free to compete subject to safeguards of fair competition <e> <s> there is the test there and there is exactly the same test in professor beesleys report <e> <s> no less an authority than my noble friend lord trefgarne said at second reading that the governments policy is that british telecom should be free to compete in the provision of telecommunications equipment services provided such competition is on a fair basis <e> <s> this amendment

grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> for giving way <e> <s> during the second reading the noble lord lord trefgarne expressed his disappointment that the analogy between the british telecommunications and the fcc was not drawn <e> <s> it was drawn with the civil aviation authority and the reason why that analogy was carefully drawn was the very simple fact that the fcc are by no means a model upon

blind people are in receipt of a free television licence <e> <s> i wonder whether she would consider some step down in the licence charged for registered deaf people on the grounds that they only receive so to speak half the service <e>", "<cs> my lords will not my noble friend agree that it is well-nigh impossible to encourage let alone to legislate for good taste <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that only recently a friend of mine in an attempt to join her husband who is working in kenya was forced to travel from the south east corner of england to peterborough in order to collect her passport herself at considerable expense <e> <s> to the distress of the peterborough passport office they were stopped from issuing the passport to her <e> <s> this was by people not directly involved in the strike <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him whether he is seriously suggesting that it is the prerogative of the aged to be scandalised <e>", "<cs> i cannot say whether the response by my noble friend lord gowrie pleases the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran but it certainly does not please me not that that particularly matters <e> <s> but what does matter and this cannot be stressed more strongly is that this clause is the nub of the bill <e> <s> we are not talking about a dry piece of administrative law <e> <s> we are talking about the industrial and commercial future of this kingdom <e> <s> there is no doubt whatsoever in my mind that at second reading the noble lord lord byers got this absolutely correct <e> <s> i must ask for your lordships forgiveness but as i believe that nobody can possibly put it better than he did i should like to quote from lord byers at col of the <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to hear my noble friend

where a whim lies in the hands of one man it is infinitely more dangerous than when it lies in the hands of members in the other place and a thousand or so in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> i do not think i have made myself absolutely clear <e> <s> clause must be read with clause <e> <s> the danger in the way it is written lies in giving with one hand the monopoly to run the whole telecommunications system of the united kingdom and derogating from it on the other hand under the provisions of clause <e> <s> if this is done if it is handled in this particular way the position of british telecommunications will not be made absolutely clear and will depend entirely on the mood of the moment <e> <s> i fully appreciate the fact that the present administration is determined to liberalise the telecommunications environment <e> <s> however why is it necessary to vest the monopoly or to maintain the monopoly in the hands of a trading corporation when they have said themselves that they intend to derogate from it <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has stated that the design which the government see as the simplest and clearest way of going about this liberalisation of the telecommunications environment was of course the way which they chose <e> <s> i am sorry to carry on about this but it is very important <e> <s> clause clearly states that <e>", "<cs> why then

under the provisions of clause <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for that explanation and i hope that that explanation will also be helpful to my noble friend lord de la warr in relation to his amendments at a later stage of the bill <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my noble friend said on an earlier occasion that the exclusive privilege was limited to the running of telecommunications systems <e> <s> i am still puzzled i should be grateful for an answer though i would understand if my noble friend were not able to give one immediately why there is

correct and i entirely accept it <e> <s> may i again ask him why there is reference in the bill to the exclusive privilege of providing services when there should be a reference only to the exclusive

directly or indirectly the current business of the post office <e> <s> i fail to see the necessity for this amendment <e>", "<cs> i agree entirely with every word that my noble friend has said <e> <s>

child of the previous administration <e> <s> it is vitally important that the secretary of state be given as much flexibility as possible since it is very difficult to limit the lead time in any

suggestion and i am most grateful for my noble friends full explanation <e> <s> with that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is not important so much that i support this amendment

question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that answer may i ask whether he is aware that if the frequencies which are recommended in

bill <e>", "<cs> i was not of course suggesting anything sinister in the use of the words exclusive privilege as applied to the services my lords <e> <s> however i believe this could be an important point because from an observation made in committee by my noble friend lord trefgarne i understood that the post office had never prayed in aid the exclusive privilege point since the passing of the act <e> <s> apparently what they do pray in aid are their property rights in the equipment that would be the cable junction boxes the telephone instruments the items which come under the terms of the schemes through which they provide the services and it is that about which i am concerned because they have the ultimate sanction of pulling out the plug <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend my lords and it would be churlish of me not to thank him warmly for a much fuller explanation than was received at an earlier stage of the bill <e> <s> with that i beg leave to withdraw the

obtain an international standard with regard to licensing and indeed to bring in the thumbless glove <e> <s> the noble lord referred in detail to the serious injuries that can obtain as a result of

noble friend this question which way did the united kingdom delegates at the council of europe vote on this issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that your lordships house owes a very great debt to shrewsbury and atcham borough council in that they have provoked the premier earl of england my noble friend lord shrewsbury into making a memorable maiden speech and delivering a swingeing attack on the promoters of the bill in that he was deeply concerned as i read it that the consultative process has not been properly gone through <e> <s> my noble friend lord shrewsbury will not remember this

one can possibly be the leader in the arms race when one is in actual fact very far behind <e>", "<cs> my lords in opening i would like to say how i delighted in the rich canadian tones of the noble lord lord shaughnessy in his maiden speech <e> <s> in fact he made me feel less alone than i usually feel in your lordships house because i believed that i was the only person who bore two titular towns neither of which are in the united kingdom <e> <s> he similarly bears two titular towns neither of which are in the united kingdom but one of which is in canada and the other in the republic of ireland <e> <s> this learnt from him and he certainly delighted me with what he had to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i do indeed welcome this clause of course and i take the point that the noble lord has raised <e> <s> but with the greatest respect to him i really am jumping in with both feet arguing with a lawyer for i am not one myself my understanding of this clause is that it is only a clause of construction as bears on the charter of rights and not on the whole of schedule b furthermore if the intention was real that these rights be recognised why was it not written in the positive within the bill of rights instead of in the negative <e> <s> as my noble friend lord renton himself raised in his excellent speech the key words are <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord byers has inferred something which i neither stated nor implied <e> <s> i think that that was very remote from what i said <e> <s> i was simply suggesting that to wash ones hands of these problems and to pretend that they do not exist is very disturbing <e> <s> if one had read the proceedings in another place which were admirable i think that one would have received the message very clearly <e> <s> our only duty is to raise these points and hope that they reach the right hearts <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble and learned lord would give way for a moment in order to back up the point that he was making <e> <s> it was interesting to me to learn that in when the british north america act was passed the word indian was not mentioned even once in either house of the british parliament <e> <s> it is interesting that today and in proceedings in another place on this bill the term indian has been used over and over again <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether the anglo part of mr beausires nationality is satisfactorily established <e>", "<cs> another point that was made very clearly on second reading was the general agreement that these matters were not as the noble lord has just suggested a matter for the british government i think everyone would agree with that <e> <s> but manifestly it is a matter for the parliament of the united kingdom and for the parliament of canada <e> <s> any government of whatever colour who are in power in the united kingdom form an integral part of parliament <e> <s> in other words the government are wearing two hats <e> <s> i quite appreciate why the government find difficulty in these matters but it is as part of the parliament of the united kingdom that the noble lord opposite is referring to them <e> <s> i wonder whether there is any comment on that <e>", "<cs> this is purely supposition but i suspect the reason why there is no direct reference within the charter of rights within the statute of liberties in this enactment is that if there was this protection <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord shinwell made a very important point when he suggested that second reading had indeed passed and that we had had the opportunity to make speeches at second reading <e> <s> however he said implicitly that this debate is liable to descend into total chaos unless it is ordered very carefully indeed on the debate as to whether schedule b shall stand part <e> <s> perhaps i may with all due humility suggest that having dealt with the point of property rights generally as raised by the noble lord lord stewart of fulham we could then pass on to the next provision of the bill which i assume-i do not know will be section and debate that as and when we get through the schedule <e> <s> i think that we will not have any answer from her majestys government at all because they appear totally incapable of wearing two hats simultaneously which on other occasions they seem to have had no difficulty whatever in doing <e> <s> i appreciate their difficulties as far as this is concerned and i appreciate that there are problems here <e> <s> but the fact is that parliament has raised these questions in both houses and that they can only sit there looking embarrassed and attempt to wash their hands of these particular issues is something which i find at the very least disturbing and extremely ignoble <e>", "<cs> the problem with section as was raised on second reading is that it is largely a clause of interpretation and construction and is in no way itself a guarantee of rights <e> <s> moreover it is only a clause of interpretation and construction as regards other provisions in the charter of rights that is sections to inclusive and not as regards schedule b as a whole <e> <s> this position was made very clear in the canadian parliament when the parliamentary secretary of state to the minister of justice mr irwin when referring to this clause said <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend to consider the point raised by the noble lord lord shackleton which he chose to ignore namely whether her majestys government would reconsider the question of reinstating hms endurance in the light of these events <e> <s> indeed these events were forecast in the debate of hms endurance when it was said that such a thing was likely to happen <e> <s> in addition bearing in mind that the west germans have built an ice patrol ship which will be patrolling these waters in the very near future may i ask my noble friend whether that signifies anything to the government regarding their decision on hms endurance <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not keep you long <e> <s> i can only hope and pray that i am received with a little bit more courtesy than was the very courageous noble earl lord gosford <e> <s> the major lesson of english history is that today as ever the estates of the realm the church parliament assembled the judiciary and the free press are as necessary both jointly and severally as they ever were in order to maintain the liberty of the subject in the face of a determined executive <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for my noble friends advice <e> <s> i in no way meant to express any feeling that there was any impropriety <e> <s> my only expression was one of sadness that the government of the day did not encourage a meaningful debate on the schedule at the committee stage <e> <s> that was the impression i was very strongly given despite the fact that everybody agreed not to table amendments and i did not mean in any way to suggest there had been impropriety of any sort <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted that the noble earl has at last spoken from his feet rather than from his bottom <e>", "<cs> i said at the beginning of my speech that i would not be long my lords and i am about to wind up <e> <s> i am confident that those few who have taken a deep and sincere interest in the subject will not now go away and forget the canada they love but will maintain a constant interest in developments in canada <e>", "<cs> my lords while i accept that matching might with might at this particular stage would probably be unhelpful may i ask whether her majestys government would consider seriously in the near future at least matching the considerable economic interest which has been shown in the area by virtually every developed country other than the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask my noble friend lord trefgarne will her majestys government constantly bear in mind their strategic principle and eschew all short-term economic expediency <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the very language that he used namely the plo for all their faults is precisely the same language as the government of the day used when referring to germany between and <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend consider asking her majestys government to promote a religious

that the progress of the british task force is an act of war is nothing if not a monstrous impertinence <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the leader of the house whether her majestys

unfortunate suggestion that somehow her majestys government or indeed her majestys loyal forces are unnecessarily and wilfully escalating military conflict <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to interrupt the

whether at any time there has been any attempt by any partner of the united kingdom within the european economic community to link some of their support in our problems in the south-west atlantic with the discussions on the agricultural pricing policy and the negotiations on the budget <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down this is a terrible impertinence but i must rise for a few moments to support the point she made regarding the external service of the bbc <e> <s> when i was in china only last january it was astonishing to me although i did know in fact that this was so that the russians had been broadcasting for many years to the chinese in english with an astonishing audibility and very close to the frequency upon which the british broadcasts are transmitted <e> <s> it

to deal quickly with his final point <e> <s> he came out with a quite astonishing contradiction in terms <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> he referred to the early leaver reaching state pensionable age

pursue that matter on the good grounds that i do not understand it <e> <s> my noble friend also suggested that one of the evil consequences that i had tried to argue would result from the implementation of schedule was that peter would be robbed by paul and that the early leaver would rightly benefit but that if there were not funds in the scheme then money could only come from the long stayers <e> <s> to put it another way my noble friend used a different term <e> <s> he called it restructuring scheme benefits <e> <s> what do noble lords think that this means <e> <s> that is

to be joking <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend not agree that to use in the question the term massivecomplex is somewhat misleading in this context bearing in mind that in terms of transmitting power the proposed transmitting station at bearley will be the smallest of all the five transmitting stations of the bbcs external services <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in the case of premature and frail babies the monitoring of breathing is standard practice by means of a very simple electronic device <e> <s> would my noble friend be good enough to look into

hope is there for trust in the argentine government generally <e>", "<cs> asked her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not the first time that your lordships should be most grateful to the

any way lessened in its importance <e>", "<cs> my lords the supporters of the argument put forward by her majestys government must feel indeed proud of the way in which the noble lord lord elton has managed to turn an argument on its head with the confidence and skill of someone who spends a great deal of his time standing on his head <e> <s> it is astonishing that the only fundamental point that he made was that the attempt of this amendment to curb admitted racial discrimination within the police should in itself be racially discriminatory <e> <s> i find that argument extremely difficult to swallow <e> <s> i must confess that i will be supporting the argument in the lobbies today <e>", "<cs> my lords would this question not be better aimed at the conscience of the president of the national union of mineworkers <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend recall that when the nationalised industries made vast losses the government used to be upbraided from all sides of the house

way of a postponement of the publication of its report or whether the report will die a natural death <e>", "<cs> of course my lords <e> <s> while thanking my noble and learned friend for his answer i should like to ask him whether the abandonment of the royal commission report is by nature a postponement of the publication of the report or whether the publication of the report will die of natural causes <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble and learned lord for moving his motion which i welcome most heartily may i ask that we never ever have to wait another years for further company law

is somehow wrong or bad that constituents should have the opportunity of getting to know their member of parliament better <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble lord recall that during the course of the debate on th october he relied very heavily on the fact that the four tenderers were british companies <e> <s> will he not agree that even though a company be thoroughly british from a proprietorial

turnover <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend why it is that when governments of whatever colour wish to spend taxpayers money they invariably refer to it as government money yet when they do not want to spend taxpayers money they call it taxpayers money <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that to suggest that this assistance is given to some strikers to purchase a house is quite misleading <e> <s> the mortgagee has already purchased his house and the only relief that is being sought is for interest on a debt <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot begin to match the erudition of the noble lord lord kennet <e> <s> my only rather thin excuse for contributing to the debate is that i have spent some little time mainly in the peoples republic of china so much so that i know peking more than i know hong kong and i know amoy or xiamen as it is now known more than i know kowloon <e> <s> i am convinced that this astonishing achievement of her majestys government in reaching agreement with regard to the future of hong kong together with the the government of the peoples republic of china will not be regarded by the historians of the future as a mere footnote to history

contribute to this debate <e> <s> however i have always believed that the law and indeed the administration of the law is far too important a subject to be left to the experts <e> <s> my only concern

the bill itself suggests and indeed the terms of the bill use it the issue of competence is absolutely central to the argument underlying the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask my noble friend whether i am right in thinking that the fundamental reason why her majestys government have decided to sell their minority interest in british aerospace lies behind the philosophy with which i happen to agree entirely that it is not the business of government to be in business <e> <s> furthermore have her majestys government considered the measure of protection that is afforded to minority shareholders which her majestys government will remain by virtue of section of the companies act which is the section designed for the protection of minorities interests <e>", "<cs> my lords my natural demurity makes me hesitate to press my noble friend but he did not answer in any way my question with regard to section of the companies act <e> <s> i understand the reason why <e> <s> may i ask whether my noble friend would be good enough to write to me on that matter <e>", "<cs> when i first read this clause i could not help but feel somewhat cynically that the only possible explanation

increase in police metropolitan or otherwise or indeed governmental endeavour to watch the watch schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend believe that there can be anybody other than the noble lord lord gladwyn who would not believe that political future is sovereignty written in another way <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble and learned friend <e> <s> at this stage i want to make it quite clear to the noble lord lord hatch of lusby that i had no intention whatsoever of taking a swipe at him <e> <s> on many occasions i have been sorely tempted so to do but not on this occasion <e> <s> all i said was that i draw no comfort from beating him by a mere hours in setting down my amendments <e> <s> i am most grateful to my noble and learned friend for his explanation

shall of course consider with great care what my noble and learned friend has said <e> <s> i could not see the power within the bill where the lord chancellor could perform this duty hence the amendment <e> <s> however i shall look more closely when i have read his argument affecting this amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> not for the first time i have learned a great deal from my noble and learned friend and in the light of his explanation i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones one question <e> <s> is this clause contained in the regulations and in the disciplinary code of the law society <e>", "<cs> that would appear eminently sensible to me <e> <s> i find it somewhat puzzling that the words recommended in the law societys brief which they were kind enough to send me as being suitable for the professional practice of licensed conveyancing do not match up with the wording which they find suitable for their own disciplinary affairs and so on <e> <s> i should have thought that what was sauce for the goose was sauce for the gander <e>", "<cs> as your lordships are aware clause makes provision for the council of licensed conveyancers to make rules prescribing the circumstances in which licensed conveyancers may in effect incorporate themselves <e> <s> there seems to be no overriding reason why there should be provision for recognised bodies <e> <s> indeed as clause is presently drafted there appears to be enough latitude for estate agents banks and building societies to become such bodies <e> <s> i have a real fear that clause may be a trojan horse <e> <s> although i am not practising at the moment as an accountant and a very bad accountant i may add in every sense of the word i recognise that there are very real dangers in the incorporation of people providing a professional service for the simple reason that there lies a real protection for the individual for the client if he has recourse to the person involved either jointly or severally in a suit in the court in the fact that the defendant in such an action need not hide behind the skirts of limited liability <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to my noble and learned friend <e> <s> he referred to the fact that this was really a dispute about tomorrow <e> <s> of course this is one of the problems in this modern day every single bill that goes through parliament is a dispute about tomorrow <e> <s> i wish to god it was a dispute for the next or years <e> <s> one of the reasons that have led to the multiplicity of legislation is that governments can think at the very most only in terms of four or five years <e> <s> if we took more trouble to get our acts right we would need far far fewer of them <e> <s> that is a very much broader matter <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to disagree with noble lords who have already spoken but i find this amendment both preposterous in principle and wholly unnecessary in practice for the simple reason that any litigant has an insurable interest in the trial judge his health and his life <e> <s> the noble lord lord mishcon suggested that this is expensive but that is just not true <e> <s> my figures show that it can be as little as per cent <e> <s> if the additional costs of a retrial come for the sake of argument to the premium would be

amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble and learned friend for that explanation and accordingly i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend satisfied that he is comparing like with like <e> <s> does he really believe that the sale of socks can be compared to the provision of a public amenity such as water <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment worries me for this very simple reason <e> <s> the appointment and dismissal of the crown prosecutors indirectly by virtue of amendment no <e> <s> and directly by virtue of amendment no <e> <s> by bringing in the attorneygeneral the attorney-general is the appointee of the government of the day politicises be it ever so slightly the appointment and dismissal of the crown prosecutors <e> <s> i believe that that would be sad <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend care to comment on one of the major conclusions of the perry committee namely that the relationship between the external services the foreign and commonwealth office and the board of governors not only needs to be clarified but is in urgent need of redefinition <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend consider requesting those asking the two unstarred questions to change the unstarred questions to motions on short debates of two and a half hours a piece <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> will he be surprised to learn that it does not go quite far enough namely he has not stated in any way the efficacy of that particular section <e> <s> why is it that successive governments have flouted the quite clear intention of parliament by virtue of the provisions of that subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords does not my noble friend consider that he has been most seriously ill-advised to hide behind the skirts of commercial decision in his original answer <e> <s> i ask that because the act makes it quite plain that it is the duty of both the secretary of state and the director-general of the office of telecommunications to exercise their functions in such a way as to enable those producing telecommunications apparatus in the united kingdom to act in a fair and proper manner <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the minister the nature of the change in circumstances to which he referred when answering an earlier supplementary <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down is she aware and i am sure she is that i too share a bedroom with my wife while i am disenfranchised but she is not <e>", "<cs> my lords i find this amendment somewhat eccentric <e> <s> it appears to me that what the amendment is asking the tribunal to do is to rule whether the determination of its ruling and direction which it issues is in all the circumstances reasonable <e> <s> i should have thought that if the tribunal itself ruled on the direction it would indeed agree that it was reasonable in the first place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not absolutely certain whether it is the same in the legal profession but if i remember rightly and this is going back about years articled clerks in an accountants firm were not employed by the firm of accountants but were articled directly by contract to an individual partner in the firm <e> <s> if that is the case within the legal profession as well then if i may say so with respect the wording of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor is absolutely correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble and learned friend <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i would support the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale in this regard <e> <s> it is important to note in amendment no <e> <s> that the word land is to be left out <e> <s> it is substantially the point that the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale made that this could cause a tremendous number of problems <e>", "<cs> my lords i just wanted to make the point to those who might think it is only marginally less impertinent to agree with the lord chancellor than it is to disagree with him <e> <s> the reason why my name is coupled to his is simply that i tabled this amendment before he did <e> <s> for the first time in my life i was accused of being both girlish and coy by the clerks and i was advised that i should not take my name away from this amendment <e> <s> that is the only reason why your lordships see this rather strange coupling <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of what my noble and learned friend has said with regard to this particular amendment may i say that i spoke only to this amendment <e> <s> though i understand the reasons why my noble and learned friend suggested that it might save the time of the committee to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and together with this amendment i deliberately did not do so <e> <s> in the light of the first point that he made in response to this amendment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i would support the amendment <e> <s> the problem that the noble lord lord mishcon has raised is a real one in the real world <e> <s> it is simply a question of what the americans call agency capture <e> <s> when bodies corporate or individuals are joined together in the forming of a body corporate to provide the services of licensed conveyancers to the public you have qualified licensed conveyancers and for want of a better term moneyed men who may join them in the formation of a body corporate to provide those services <e> <s> the control of these particular bodies corporate will belong to those who provide the initial capital of the company rather than to those who are professional men providing a service to the consumer <e> <s> i may be totally wrong but this is the very danger that the noble lord lord mishcon is trying to avoid in the general public interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i am greatly comforted by the words of my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor in and i do not think that i use too strong a word his undertaking with regard to this issue <e> <s> i shall of course read what he said with very great care but i believe that his argument with regard to these matters is as i said initially a source of comfort <e> <s> with that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords no one could agree more with the sentiments of the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale than i do <e> <s> my rather pathetic defence is that i did not draft this clause myself <e> <s> however as i have taken responsibility for it i accept his strictures <e> <s> i also entirely agree with what the noble lord lord airedale said but what was more important was that i wanted to hear it from the mouth of my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor rather than from him <e> <s> having heard that i am happy and reassured by my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord in question had made his own notes at the time this question would not arise at all <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that for many years the city of paris clamped vehicles there but they have now completely given it up as a bad job i believe for the reasons which have been mentioned by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> did the ministry consider initially for want of a better term the parisian experience in arriving at their determination to experiment <e> <s> if not have they considered it in the course of the experimentation before coming to their current view upon which we are about to decide <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend

friend has not answered the question concerning how much of the taxpayers money will be needed to finance the manufacture of these aircraft by shorts which has managed to submit a tender which is very much lower than the other contenders <e> <s> furthermore is my noble friend aware that many people will welcome this decision in that it is directly in line with the conservative philosophy of supporting private enterprise in this country rather than state-owned corporations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor for that response and indeed for the most distinguished support that i have received from both the cross-benches and the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> his point is a very valid one and if i may respectfully say so it would certainly cause an odd conflict between sections and <e>", "<cs> as a layman perhaps i may leap in here <e> <s> with respect i would suggest that the proposal of the noble and learned lord lord denning that amendment no <e> <s> is an attempt to re-interpret article which covers the interpretation of rights of custody just cannot be right <e> <s> in his reference to clause the noble lord lord mishcon forgot clause of the bill which says <e>", "<cs> while we are at this point it is also true of article and article they are not there and article about which we have been speaking and article which is missing from schedule <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may intervene briefly the noble lord lord mishcon referred to the deliberate avoidance of taxation but i am sure he meant the deliberate evasion of taxation <e> <s> it will not be lost upon the noble lord of all people that years ago a learned judge said that the avoidance of tax was a personal duty to ones family but the evasion of tax was a crime <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it will come as any surprise to the house least of all to the noble lord lord shackleton if i do not follow the noble lord who has just spoken except to say that there are values other than economic and also that expediency is ever the enemy of justice <e> <s> but i should like to say that to take part in a debate led by the noble lord lord shackleton is both a daunting experience and an extremely stimulating privilege <e> <s> it is my suggestion that it would take a brave and indeed arrogant government to ignore his views <e> <s> those two previous governments who ignored the major recommendation of the first report of the noble lord lord shackleton in to lengthen and improve the runway at stanley so major a recommendation that it was telegraphed to her majestys government well in advance of the publication of the report have both learned to live with the knowledge that the cost of ignoring that advice was not just in money but also in lives <e>", "<cs> my lords my memory serves me that it was one of my noble friends colleagues who originally made the assertion in reply to a question for written answer in another place <e> <s> i am surprised that my noble friend takes credit for that statement because it is one for which i myself should not like to take credit <e>", "<cs> my lords that is as may be <e> <s> the point is that i well remember his response on that occasion when he rather airy-fairily suggested that he did not want to get into the qualitative and quantitative argument <e> <s> but that is a detailed point <e> <s> the major dishonesty of which we must be very careful is that of any government if they are so vague so vacillating and so insecure in their convictions that predators of ones own interests and indeed of the free worlds are encouraged to feed off those interests <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether one of the governments proposals to the argentine government is that they now officially declare at last cessation of hostilities <e>", "<cs> my lords just because a judgment was deemed professional that does not necessarily mean to say that it was sound <e> <s> what if anything can her majestys government do about that <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first apologise to the house for leaping up in the gap on the speakers list <e> <s> i want to raise one point of such

expenditure of billion of taxpayers money by her majestys government can hardly be described as mere exhortation <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not agree that it is not for her to withdraw

friend agree that the day when we should really start worrying is the day when the overseas and long-distance coaches cease visiting london <e>", "<cs> i too am concerned about the necessity for this

more to do with gall <e> <s> i find it very sad that so few noble lords who are not lawyers have contributed to the second reading of this critically important bill <e> <s> that is not a criticism but merely an observation <e> <s> i say that because perhaps the most exciting thing that i find about the bill this is one of the reasons why i welcome it so warmly is that its whole style and form recognise strongly something which might come as a great surprise to those who practise the law at whatever level that is that the law is there for the people of this country <e> <s> that means the entire million people in this country <e> <s> it is not designed for the benefit of those who practise it at any level <e> <s> i say that as strongly as i possibly can because i have been astonished on former occasions and frankly somewhat horrified at the reaction of some of the most senior members of the bench and the bar to these proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords the judiciary in itself has nothing whatsoever to fear <e> <s> i have never in my life met a judge who was in the least frightened of voicing an opinion and getting his opinion across <e> <s> i see absolutely no reason why the judiciary or the bar should be in fear of the bill <e> <s> are the bench and the bar such tender flowers that they need statutory protection <e> <s> i do not believe a word of it <e>", "<cs> following on from what the noble lord lord mishcon has said i wish the amendment stated that <e> <s> it does not refer to the interests of the parties but to the wishes of the parties concerned <e> <s> so often the wishes of the parties concerned are in direct conflict with their interests <e>", "<cs> it is worth stressing that this is not an excessive power <e> <s> under subsection as i read it the power is only to make an order to amend or repeal any provision as a consequence of an order under subsection or to present orders that are incidental and transitional to that major power <e> <s> in the circumstances it is by no means a draconian power <e>", "<cs> in answer to a previous question my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor stated quite clearly that clause did not give power to the lord chancellor to take jurisdiction away from the high court <e> <s> it gives him power to confer jurisdiction on the high court only in relation to proceedings <e>", "<cs> one aspect of the amendment concerns me slightly as the amendment is drafted if an applicant seeks leave from the county court to appeal against the decision that had been made by the local housing authority by virtue of section of the housing act the court is required to be i quote from subsection <e>", "<cs> before we leave this amendment if the words under this section were included after the word direction in clause as in clause the position would be made a great deal clearer <e> <s> undoubtedly the observation of the noble lord lord mishcon on clause makes it absolutely plain that any power to make orders or regulations conferred by this act shall be exercisable by statutory instrument and other than those mentioned will be subject to the negative resolution procedure of either house of parliament <e>

amendment in any way impaired by the fact that it has been placed in what i shall call the declaratory law part of part ii namely clause and not in a substantive part of the bill <e> <s> i am slightly concerned by that <e>", "<cs> i suggest that in terms of time practicality is most reasonable <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord ackner mentioned the practicality with regard to the time taken to

different use of words <e>", "<cs> perhaps on the back of this amendment i may take up the invitation which my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor proffered to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that explanation <e> <s> i was astonished at the number of people who know more about the construction of statutes than i do who did not go to the root of the

few moments ago <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i rise not least for the reason that my name is attached to this amendment <e> <s> another reason for rising is that at a late hour last week my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor accepted a suggestion concerning the institute of legal executives or managing clerks as they were known <e> <s> i referred to the interests of these members and asked for these matters to be considered between now and the next stage of the bill <e> <s> it is for that reason that i do not wish to delay the committee in any way

subject <e> <s> will he be good enough to let me know what direct benefit will accrue to mankind as a result of such studies <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that many would be
