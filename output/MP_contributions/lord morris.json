["<cs> my lords i rise to support my noble friend lord teviot and also the noble lord lord renton because i have serious misgivings with regard to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am concerned that if one asks a man to prove that he did all that he reasonably could it places a greater burden on him than if you ask him to prove that he did that which could be reasonably expected of him <e> <s> i am also rather puzzled as to why the government have departed from the wording that they used in clause which i think is a far better test and simply stated <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him with respect whether he has any sympathy for the device which they enjoy at the council of europe in which there are nation-states but only two official languagesnamely english and french <e> <s> bearing in mind that the council of europe has been in existence and highly succesfully since does he not think that due consideration should be given to this particular point by the european economic community <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness may find it helpful if i say that in the supplementary note to clause in these very helpful notes on clauses which the government have issued copies of which noble lords will find in the printed paper office there is a very clear definition of what the bill means by a <e>", "<cs> from what i have heard from noble lords opposite i get the distinct impression that hundreds of people are queuing up to serve as governors of schools and that these posts are being bitterly contested <e> <s> i do not think that that is the case and i should like clarification on that point <e>", "<cs> i must support my noble friend on this point <e> <s> the noble lord lord stewart of fulham mentioned twins <e> <s> as a twin i feel i should record the fact that at the age of or thereabouts my twin brother and i both took the same entrance examination <e> <s> i passed it with flying colours and he failed it miserably <e> <s> our parents came to the conclusion that it would be wrong to divide us so we went to the same school <e> <s> the result of all this is that my brother is still as thick as he ever was <e>", "<cs> it is with very great trepidation that i speak of very serious reservations with regard to this amendment <e> <s> i speak to this amendment as the father of a handicapped childand i seriously believe that this amendment really is pie in the sky because i know from bitter experience that there are very few special schools and very few special educational establishments in the country <e> <s> this is a fact of life <e> <s> so when those who have spoken to this amendment speak of parental preferences or of the hope of parental preferences there are none <e>", "<cs> i should answer the noble lord opposite <e> <s> the point that he made is a fair one <e> <s> i found that the help one gets from the special schools in terms of information and in every single way is enormous <e> <s> they go to tremendous lengths to consult with parents so far as the decisions on the schooling of their children are concerned so far as information is concerned and so far as what is best for the child is concernedand they do so to a greater extent than happens with the parents of children who are in a more fortunate position <e>", "<cs> my lords in considering this clause i put to your lordships the premise that if one looks to the language one will find the truth <e> <s> i believe that my noble friend lady young has seriously misled herself or rather has seriously been misled in that she said in her earlier remarks that the local education authorities still have a duty to provide <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend and as a result i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend not agree that one of the arts of government is the ordering of priorities <e> <s> furthermore would he not agree that cuts across the board which have been suggested can hardly be described as a subtle demonstration of that art <e>", "<cs> it is always a delight to talk to the noble baroness and in view of what she has said i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>"]
