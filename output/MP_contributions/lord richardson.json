["<cs> my lords some four years ago the first tri-service advisory body to the ministry of defence was set up <e> <s> it is a civilian body and i have the honour of being its chairman <e> <s> it is for that reason that i as a doctor crave your lordships indulgence for making my maiden speech in a defence debate <e>", "<cs> my lords the unstarred question which the noble lord lord annan has asked the government has two parts to it <e> <s> first he inquires whether satisfactory provision has already been made for medical education in london <e> <s> i agree most strongly with the noble lord lord annan and the noble lord lord garner that the government cannot but feel that the provision is inadequate <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord hill of luton i was a student of the late lord adrian and formed an admiration and a love for him which was very commonly held <e> <s> it was thus with great delight that i listened to the enormous success of his son when he made his maiden speech this afternoon <e> <s> my pleasure at this however was considerably muted by the fact that he said many of the things that i had wished to say and said them so much better than i would have if i had attempted to say them <e> <s> so i must confine myself strictly to matters that he did not stress although he mentioned them <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations and pleasure at having heard the maiden speeches of the noble earl lord erne and the noble baroness lady ryder of warsaw <e> <s> both said things that must have had great interest to your lordships and in particular to a doctor <e> <s> towards the end of his speech the noble lord lord rochester referred to what seems to me the very pertinent wording of lord winstanleys motion <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord porritt described this issue before us as simple <e> <s> i agree with him <e> <s> i think the evidence for this was amply put by the brilliant preliminary and short opening address by the noble lord lord nugent of guildford <e> <s> i wish to say straight away that my profession the medical profession is profoundly grateful to the noble lord lord nugent for seeing that this issue that they consider vital is once more before your lordships house <e> <s> when i presume to speak for the medical profession in a united sense i am indeed presumptuous but i have behind me the weight of the british medical association as your lordships have been told and more than the weight of the royal college of surgeons alone the weight of all the colleges that meet together as a conference all <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak as the immediate past president of the general medical council who was concerned from the point of view of the council the regulating and registrating body of the medical profession with the implementation of the national health service act <e> <s> it worked very well <e> <s> i know that the noble baroness the minister and indeed all noble lords and baronesses who have spoken this evening regret that those provisions cannot for eec legal reasons be continued <e> <s> i am however concerned about what i see as a gap <e> <s> we have been talking about national health service employees government employees where employers have to decide about the competence of those they propose to employ and how in the case of doctors they will use the existing mechanism <e> <s> that mechanism works and i feel sure that it will continue to work <e> <s> but what about those who come to this country who are not employed by the national health service and whose employers are not concerned to have them tested for their linguistic competence or those who will have no employers except themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords by a happy chance there was published last year a booklet called <e>", "<cs> i am not a psychiatrist but i have been informed by psychiatric opinion that although the likelihood of effective treatment of psychopaths cannot be expressed as very hopeful in fact perhaps it is diminishing it is nevertheless thought that the age bar is no longer relevant and it was a mistake that it was ever put in <e> <s> the informed view that i have received is that attempts should be made to treat psychopaths of all ages albeit despite the not very hopeful feelings in regard to the prognosis <e>", "<cs> briefly i am certain that would be the case in any well-ordered hospital <e> <s> there could be no question of a patients being left without some medical supervision with the ability to prescribe drugs that are necessary in an emergency or indeed to prescribe drugs the order for the dispensing of which has lapsed <e>", "<cs> no doctor could fail to have great sympathy with the views expressed by the noble baroness lady masham that patients should be properly investigated and that organic disease should not be missed in psychiatric hospitals <e> <s> but i must point out that the training of psychiatrists contains a very high element of training in organic medicine at a sophisticated level <e> <s> certainly those who achieve consultant status in obtaining the higher diplomas <e>", "<cs> may i follow the noble lord lord winstanley who has put to your lordships the sequence in consultation and decision-making about the advice to be given to patients and to their relatives <e> <s> in parenthesis i should like to defend my profession against lord rentons suggestion that their instinct is to agree with each other <e> <s> i believe that your lordships can think of examples where doctors disagree <e> <s> the opinion having been formed by the doctors with one two or even more consultations sometimes from different disciplines within medicine it is normally presented to the patient and to the family <e> <s> then as the noble lord lord winstanley quite rightly said if the treatment and advice is refused the matter ends there <e> <s> the doctors make the best of the job as they see it a bad job in the interests of the patient <e> <s> i feel that your lordships would agree that while the purely medical period of forming an opinion is in process it should be conducted on the same sort of principles as in organic disease with the discussion and the formation of an opinion from perhaps several different opinions <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot avoid a feeling of sadness over the fact that the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i crave your lordships indulgence to allow me to leave the house before the end of the debate and i offer my apologies to the noble lord the minister and to my noble friend lord rugby <e> <s> i have an engagement of many months standing that i feel i cannot possibly break <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by saying how fascinated i was as a brother professional of the noble lord lord winstanley by the account he gave to your lordships particularly about the problems of leucotomy the changes that occur in the treatment situation and the dangers that attach to treatment <e> <s> he stressed to your lordships what was the situation or years ago when patients were subjected to electro-convulsive therapy <e> <s> the whole situation is now quite different as he made very clear to your lordships <e> <s> i feel that in our considerations we must allow enough room for manoeuvre in case a treatment such as a hormone treatment becomes manifestly less dangerous or even not at all dangerous so that we are not too rigid in our definition of special concern <e> <s> i feel sure that the noble lord lord winstanley would agree with that <e>", "<cs> my lords i will endeavour to be brief <e> <s> i was particularly grateful to my noble friend lord hunter of newington for finding time in his far-reaching survey of the health services to mention medical officers of health and the great importance of their work in the past which has been taken over by the community physicians <e> <s> i was extremely pleased to hear what the noble lord the minister had to say about community physicians and their great importance because i must tell you that community physicians feel that their position is threatened <e> <s> there is a faculty of community medicine which was set up by the three royal colleges in great britain and the president of that faculty has informed me that they are suffering considerable anxiety <e> <s> one reason is historical <e> <s> in they lost their security of tenure which had been given to them by an act of parliament for a long period for the very good reason that they could be in contention with their employers <e> <s> they could still be in contention with their colleagues <e> <s> that is the historical side <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak as a doctor and therefore i want to emphasise some of the points that have been so ably made by the noble lord lord seebohm that affect the practice of medicine particularly in this country <e> <s> radiographers are the people who take the photographs when we go to hospital and they in their practice are quite essential to the whole of radiography in this country <e> <s> they are an independent profession although they are answerable to radiologists who are of course fully qualified and specialist qualified doctors <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him a question <e> <s> when he said that anyone could put the name or the title doctor legally in front of his name in this country he does not recognise that it is a criminal offence to pretend <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware when he said that the decision as to whether a case was an emergency or not was a matter of clinical judgment that in all cases it is indeed a matter of clinical judgment and that the judgment is not taken for reasons other than clinical or by people other than those qualified to take that judgment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord lord nugent of guildford is right as he is in so many things when he says that the medical profession will apply medical exemptions very carefully and conscientiously and will try to minimise their number because there is so little justification for them to do otherwise <e> <s> i am equally sure that they will wish to follow the suggestion of the noble baroness lady stedman that temporary exemption should be used and that exemptions should be reviewed from time to time <e> <s> i think that this means that doctors who will be concerned with giving exemption will be determined to do so scrupulously and i hope that the fee that has been discussed between the minister of transport and the bma will be seen as reflecting the possibility of a great deal of careful work having to go into the signing of and estimating the justification for the certificate <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to speak upon one point and one point only but it has a direct bearing on the private/public mix <e> <s> it concerns private practice within the nhs hospitals <e> <s> i wish to make it quite clear that i am unequivocally committed to the continuation of the nhs and have spent my life in it <e> <s> my views are therefore entirely based on my wishes for the prosperity in a wide sense of the nhs and they are not influenced by any interest in private practice although i have practised privately and in hospital <e> <s> simply expressed i am convinced that private practice within the nhs is for the good of the nhs and its patients <e>", "<cs> my lords no one has to persuade your lordships of the importance in the practice of medicine of communication and confidentiality <e> <s> therefore i have no subject in that direction <e> <s> i have however arrived with a brief from the british medical association and had the fascinating experience of hearing my clothes or what i thought were clothes being stolen by the noble and learned lord a past lord chancellor <e> <s> it was slightly disturbing but it was fascinating and indeed humiliating to realise how very much better he made use of exactly the material that i had in my hand <e> <s> i am however left with a minimum of clothing in a brief from the bma about the importance to patients <e> <s> this is not concerned with doctors and the doctor relationship but with the doctors concern for patients as patients <e> <s> i refer to clause which deals with compensation for unauthorised disclosure <e> <s> if the clause becomes law a patient would be required not only to prove unauthorised disclosure which is fair enough but that damage has occurred <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether when he is considering the whole of this report he will take particular note of the importance of persuading the public that the government and all concerned really mean to take the subject seriously <e> <s> mental health is a subject about which it is difficult to persuade the public to be serious in the light of other pressures and other demands <e>", "<cs> my lords any of those doctors who had mutual work with the noble lord lord ennals when he was secretary of state would expect his maiden speech to be of the quality that it was today and would not presume to congratulate him because that is what one would undoubtedly expect <e>", "<cs> my lords the difference in the way that we should think about the mentally ill and the physically ill is very small and the way in which we should attempt to relieve the mentally ill who have returned to the community is indeed compatible with the best medical principles as practised throughout medicine today <e> <s> we believe and in this of course the government encourage us that patients should not be in hospital longer than they need be and that they should be cared for properly when they return to the community <e> <s> this is widely accepted and the periods in hospital for physical illness are always reducing <e>", "<cs> my lords there is little that is specific in this report and in our discussions up to this point about the position of medical research <e> <s> it is for this reason that i am particularly grateful to the noble lord lord sherfield for giving me the opportunity of making some points to your lordships points that in a way may be quite unnecessary in that no one can doubt the importance of medical research to the individual but there are signs of the importance of medical research to the economy of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he can tell the house the cost of the board membership of which is entirely voluntary <e> <s> furthermore may i ask him whether he appreciates that the members of that board not only represented all the specialties of medicine but also nursing and indeed the chief medical officer of the department of health attended and that those board members were men who had taken special care and trouble to study and understand in detail the problems of the armed forces medical services and were not just a collection of distinguished academics or specialists <e> <s> can he assure the house that the savings on the abolition of this board can be justified by the loss of a unique and entirely unchallenged source of advice unique and unchallenged in the experience of the armed forces medical services <e>", "<cs> my lords to sit on your lordships committee under the chairmanship of the noble lord lord gregson was to have a splendid coaching class in the art of amiable penetrating inquiry <e> <s> the report before your lordships indicates the truth of that contention <e> <s> it is not surprising therefore that the noble lord emphasised very clearly that the main recommendation related to a voluntary code of practice <e> <s> this conclusion was reached after very careful discussion <e> <s> the trade unions do not agree <e> <s> the royal college of nursing does not agree <e> <s> the bma does not agree <e> <s> the royal college of physicians through its faculty of occupational health does not agree <e> <s> the possibility envisaged by the committee is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure you were all much impressed by the lucidity and the manner in which the noble baroness lady cox introduced this question <e> <s> it was in fact no surprise to me <e> <s> she is the daughter of an illustrious surgeon who wrote a textbook of medicine whose brevity and lucidity were such that it enabled me to compete with my cambridge examiners years ago <e> <s> my only anxiety this evening is that many of the points that i wished to make were made by her and that you my lords will have the same sensation that doubtless my examiners had that i had read the book but had not understood it nearly so well as the author had <e>", "<cs> we have been talking about the meaning of words <e> <s> as a doctor i wish to take up a moment of your lordships time in talking about the meaning of words to doctors who will have to deal with these problems <e> <s> the noble baroness lady seear said that mental health was a vague term <e> <s> i assure her it is not a vague term to doctors <e> <s> they understand it and they use it constantly although it covers an enormous spectrum from the frankly insane to the sadly anxious <e> <s> cosmetic means nothing in terms of surgery except for face-lifts and putting straight noses and matters such as that <e> <s> it is a very ill-defined term to the minds of doctors and as the noble lord has just said it would be a very vague term in the courts <e>", "<cs> i certainly see the point which the noble lord lord hatch has raised that women of a certain ethos and belief could become mentally ill if they are not allowed to conform with their beliefs and that it could lead to tremendous conflict <e> <s> that situation is bound to arise <e> <s> i cannot do more than say it might well be that expert opinions most carefully considered in their giving could lead to special requests for this operation to be done <e> <s> i cannot see that there could not be administrative arrangements in order to allow it <e> <s> it would have to be done by ensuring that impartial opinion of the highest level is obtained so that those who are willing to do these operations for money are not enabled to do so because of the very weight of opinion it would have to support <e>", "<cs> i shall answer the question put to me by the noble lord lord hatch <e> <s> the answer is that the words proposed would not constitute any barrier to the proper practice of medicine <e> <s> those words are such that they should be carefully considered as to whether they provide a clear enough substitute for custom and ritual <e> <s> that is what the noble lord lord hatch is asking should be done <e>", "<cs> if there is an abnormality which is a significant abnormality in the assessment of a case it should be dealt with medically <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness the minister aware that on th october last year at a meeting in the other place between her right honourable friend the minister of health and representatives from those concerned in the region of st thomas hospital and the district the minister said there was no likelihood of any of the three teaching hospitals in that area being closed <e> <s> he went on to say that the worst thing that could happen would be that those hospitals should be destroyed by attrition <e> <s> is the minister aware that the staff of st thomas hospital of which i am an exmember will be reassured by what she said but only up to a point <e> <s> st thomas hospital is facing an acute incompatibility <e> <s> it is being required by the region on the one hand to take over <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that st thomas hospital is being asked to take over many commitments while at the same time having its budget reduced to the extent of approximately million a year <e> <s> finally <e>", "<cs> my lords finally is the minister of the opinion that the noble lord lord cledwyn put an extremely important question when he asked whether these hospitals should be treated nationally rather than as local problems <e>", "<cs> my lords as a doctor i think i can claim to be particularly grateful to the noble lord lord prys-davies for putting down this motion and particularly for the clear way in which he has asked questions <e> <s> already your lordships have made clear the invaluable and essential services to medicine as a whole that are given by the academic staff of hospitals <e> <s> already i think it is possible to make a statement about the questions implied in the motion <e> <s> what is the state of academic medicine <e> <s> it is near to desperation and the morale barometer is falling to hurricane levels <e> <s> the effect on the nhs is a very present and increasing threat to efficiency and a certain threat in the future to standards <e> <s> the reasons for that have already been clearly stressed the threat to teaching and to research <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware of a specific example that illustrates a point made in the last but one question and which concerns the north devon hospice trust of which i have the honour to be president <e> <s> it is a newly-formed trust in an area which is not especially wealthy <e> <s> it has budgeted for its out-patient functions which are its sole functions it has no beds of its own and to extend its day-care services which are enormously <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords who have already spoken i too welcome the report <e> <s> i also appreciate the lucidity and completeness of the comments made upon it by previous speakers which allow me to focus my remarks literally on one word <e> <s> my comments will relate to the interests of medical students who have occupied so large a part of my thinking during my lifetime <e>", "<cs> my lords i too have had the privilege of knowing the noble lord lord butterfield for years <e> <s> i was mildly interested when he spoke about going in to bat <e> <s> my interest was considerably increased when he mentioned cambridge more than once because he used to go in to bat for an oxford cricket xi <e> <s> we all hope that we shall hear a great deal from him in the future <e> <s> knowing him i know that he will be eloquent <e>", "<cs> my lords in common with many of your lordships i felt considerable gratitude toward the noble lord lord hunter when i saw that he had tabled this motion so quickly after the publication of the white paper <e> <s> like the noble lord lord winstanley i feel acute anxiety over the timing of discussions having experienced the telescoping of time by successive governments in the discussion of important matters relevant to medicine and the health service <e>", "<cs> for years i was a non-executive medical member of the teaching hospitals and governors before they were abolished <e> <s> i find it difficult to imagine how they could possibly come to the conclusions that would satisfy the non-medical governors if the experts were not present and if those experts did not have local significance as well as medical eminence <e> <s> i strongly support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords having been trained as a doctor i have an instinctive dislike of the thought of any control through regulation or legislation of a doctors duties towards his patients <e> <s> for the most part young doctors are extremely keen they certainly should be to learn and to work with patients during the early years of their training <e> <s> they stay on duty because that is their wish <e> <s> they follow the cases through because they know that that is how life will have to be for them and they know that that is how they should carry on their affairs <e>"]
