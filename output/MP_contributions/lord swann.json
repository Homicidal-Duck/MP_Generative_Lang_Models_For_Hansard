["<cs> my lords it must always i think be a matter for some alarm to make a speech in a new environment and in none so much as this august one <e> <s> the noble baroness lady david has laid a bait so infinitely attractive to someone who has been an academic for most of his life that i found the temptation unable to be resisted <e> <s> but the whole business is alarming the more so in that of all the issues which she might have chosen what could be more contentious than this and therefore more unsuitable for a maiden speaker <e> <s> if to noble lords my speech may seem odd on occasions i hope they will attribute it to what as a biologist i recognise as displacement activities which are peculiar or irrelevant things which an animal does or which a human animal says when confronted with wholly unresolvable conflicting pressures <e>", "<cs> my lords so many noble lords have made so many valid points that i think i can easily be brief as the noble lord lord byers hoped we all would be and as indeed we all have been <e> <s> however i must fleetingly point out one or two things <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords my not very many lords i too hope that the government are going to act on these recommendations <e> <s> i had been feeling up till now that the governments response had about as much steam in it as the heating pipes of the house of lords until a few minutes ago and i take it therefore as a good omen that the chamber has become decidedly warmer in the last few minutes <e> <s> nevertheless one must give credit where credit is due and i at least welcome albeit only a very small move in what i believe is the right direction recommended by the rampton report the home secretarys announcement that he is going in for some experimental monitoring of the amount and extent of the employment of ethnic minorities in the civil service <e>", "<cs> my lords i doubt whether the noble lord lord sherfield needs yet another congratulation from the most junior new boy of his committee <e> <s> nevertheless i should like to join with the other members of the committee in saying that he has done a splendid job with a rare capacity for distilling wisdom from a plethora of opinion <e> <s> i want to pick up what i think is the most important thing that emerges from all the evidence that came in and i believe that other noble lords will feel the same namely the feeling that in recent years governments have in some way downgraded the status of scientific advice <e> <s> noble lords have talked solemnly and seriously on this matter and i hope i shall not be thought frivolous if i take a more lighthearted look at it because true words are often spoken in jest <e>", "<cs> my lords i too like the noble lord lord ashby and i suspect one of two others am one of lady whites conscripts <e> <s> to be honest i do not think that she need have bothered with me because others have said almost everything that i would have said and they have said it with much more knowledge and authority <e> <s> since the hour is late i am not going to paraphrase the same things that have been said <e> <s> there are a handful of points i should like to raise one of which has been said before but i want to repeat it <e> <s> the others have not been picked up and are perhaps worth mentioning briefly <e> <s> this is a remarkably well-written report <e> <s> i have read a fearful lot of government reports in my day and i have been responsible for the production of quite a number <e> <s> i cannot think of one that is so clear and is so well written <e> <s> as a result of effortless reading one knows what it is all about <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are all agreed that this is a most unusual report it is unusual because it is written by an unusual man and by him alone it could certainly never have been written by a committee for after all and as a biologist i have always relished this is not a camel a horse designed by a committee <e> <s> it is only necessary to read the first page of the report and then chapter where the nature of the social sciences is explained with great elegance to realise why governments find them baffling and confusing and above all irritating <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble viscount lord buckmaster but unlike him and unlike the other noble lords who either have spoken or are going to speak i can count myself only a novice in the matter of ethnic minorities <e> <s> my initiation which was sudden and bewildering took place only a little over two years ago it came about because nearly five years ago in the final months of the last labour administration and as a response to the report of the select committee on race relations and immigration the then government set up under the chairmanship of mr anthony rampton a committee of inquiry into the education of children from ethnic minority groups <e> <s> the membership of the committee was completed by the next conservative administration <e> <s> the terms of reference were quite wide ranging beyond the educational system <e> <s> and because it was suspected that west indians did particularly badly at school the committee was asked to make an interim report directed specifically at that problem <e> <s> they set about their task i know with much vigour <e> <s> they paid a great many visits they sought much evidence and early in they presented their report <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble lord lord rea for raising this matter <e> <s> i am sure like him and others that this is quite a serious hazard <e> <s> when one talks about food poisoning one tends to think of a few days or weeks of discomfort and very often no more than that <e> <s> on the other hand as the noble lord lord rea said a number of people although not many die from it <e> <s> the reason is usually that the salmonella bacterium has gone out of their intestines and into their blood <e> <s> one might normally expect that to be controlled by antibiotics but as the noble lord mentioned it is becoming increasingly clear that quite a lot of the salmonella bugs have become resistant to bacteria and indeed some of them have become alarmingly multiply resistant <e>", "<cs> my lords i like earlier speakers think this is an admirable joint report <e> <s> it covers a whole series of problems and decisions that have to be made in the world of research and development and all against a very welcome background of concern for our industrial decline something which has in fact been going on for years or more but which accelerated very much indeed in recent years and which is all the more puzzling because of the high status of british research <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i too may be forgiven if i leave this interesting and important debate before the end but i have a long-standing and inescapable engagement in a good cause <e> <s> as a natural scientist or perhaps in honesty i should say once a natural scientist as well as once a member of two of the scientific research councils i first thought of talking about the areas i know most of but i guessed correctly that there would be no shortage of noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree in large measure but i would also say that there is no clear distinction between what one might call the social end of the biological sciences and the biological end of the social sciences <e> <s> if one wishes to remove the word sciences i see no objection science really only means knowledge <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of his distinguished career in finance and industry i am sure that it comes as no surprise to any of us that the noble lord lord williams should have given us a maiden speech of such exemplary clarity and wisdom <e> <s> i am sure that i speak for all of us when i say that we hope to hear him many times in the future <e> <s> may i also echo the words of former speakers about our two other maiden speakers the noble and learned lord lord silkin and in particular an erstwhile fellow academic and old friend of mine the noble baroness lady warnock <e>", "<cs> unlike the noble lord lord mottistone i do not want to oppose the question that clause stand part but i have one reservation about the clause <e> <s> first i welcome very much indeed the proposal that scheme members and their dependants can now find out all about their company schemes <e> <s> regrettably there are still some companies loath to provide such information <e> <s> as chairman of the company pensions information centre again i warmly welcome the raising of the level of awareness about how pension schemes work the benefits they provide and their cost <e>", "<cs> i must take issue with the noble baroness <e> <s> it has been my modest experience that the public sector on occasions such as this is extremely cavalier about giving pensions to hard-working members of the public <e> <s> it took me seven years despite many promises to achieve a pension as chairman of the bbc <e> <s> i am glad to see that my director-general is being brought into the fold <e> <s> i think it is entirely right and proper <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> i am aware of the point she raises about the amendments effect in terms of money <e> <s> in fact as the years go by it becomes a trivial difference but i agree that initially there is a difference <e> <s> however i do not wish to pursue the matter and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill covers a wide range of complex issues and you will be relieved that it is only in one area that i feel competent to speak <e> <s> it concerns occupational and personal pensions <e> <s> like many of us i suffered from the vagaries of pensions but it is only during the last year or so that i began to learn about them in earnest when i became chairman of the company pensions information centre a post previously held with distinction by the late lord byers <e> <s> some of your lordships will know what this organisation does but for those who do not i should say that it provides detached education and information for a wide range of bodies ranging from employers and trade unionists to accountants and citizens advice bureaux <e>", "<cs> one of the disadvantages of being a cross-bencher is that one finds oneself sympathising in considerable measure with powerfully held views on both sides of the committee <e> <s> anticipating that this would be the case i put down amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it would be helpful i believe if i say that i am delighted to hear what the noble baroness the minister has said and to say that i shall not be moving amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i must indeed thank the noble baroness and perhaps remind her that in this very house a year or so ago commenting on something that i had said she said that she felt like mrs mopp and she wished to ask could she do me now sir <e> <s> she has done me twice this evening splendidly and most graciously <e> <s> i shall try to respond equally graciously and so i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i share the concern of those who have spoken in favour of this amendment <e> <s> i also share the worry about the doubts that have been expressed by those who are against it <e> <s> but i shall not go over the ground that many noble lords have already covered ably and i want to look at the problem from rather a different point of view <e> <s> i think i can claim rather a lot of experience of the problem having been vice-chancellor of the university of edinburgh throughout what was called the student revolution in the late s and early s <e> <s> and unlike members of the government and in common with only a very small handful of noble lords i have had to deal with near riots and attempts to prevent visiting speakers from being heard on a scale far worse than anything we have now <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i too may be excused if i have to leave as i fear that i will before the end of this important debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i too thank the noble lord lord annan for starting this debate and speaking with his usual panache and perception though i feel bound to remind him that when his committee was investigating the bbc i do not remember him being so complimentary to myself and the noble lord lord bonham-carter <e>", "<cs> my lords although he has had to leave i want to add my tribute to the noble lord lord dainton a very old friend of mine for his characteristically perceptive maiden speech <e> <s> i want also to congratulate the noble lord lord sherfield and his colleagues on an extremely valuable report <e> <s> i can only hope that the government will not merely welcome it as so often happens with such reports but will actually do something about it and especially the first three recommendatons <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first of all to thank the noble lord lord croham without whose report we should never have had this debate <e> <s> i did not expect the noble baroness to agree with what i said but i thank her nonetheless for responding so deftly on behalf of the government <e> <s> perhaps i may finally address a word or two to the speakers or if i discount myself those of your lordships who have spoken and who have raised a remarkable number of extremely interesting and diverse points some critical of the report and some supportive of it <e> <s> finally if it is not presumptuous i congratulate those speakers including myself twice over for our skill in concluding this debate in almost precisely the allotted span of two and half hours <e> <s> i ask leave to withdraw my motion <e>", "<cs> my lords given the present unhappiness of the scientific and academic world the initiative of the noble lord lord sherfield is particularly timely <e> <s> i regret having to apologise to your lordships for the possibility that i may have to leave before the end of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords as chairman of the company pensions information centre a small organisation which i think will be well known to some of the ministers officials and which provides information on the endless legislative complexities of every sort of pension not only to industry but to trade unions and others as well i should like to draw your lordships attention briefly to some implications of clause about which i am concerned <e>", "<cs> the minister said that hope springs eternal <e> <s> it did and thanks to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter it still does <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords a quartet of cross-bench peers all of us scientists have felt most concerned with the issue of academic freedom raised in the bill <e> <s> a while ago we decided that there should be tabled a reasoned amendment on second reading <e> <s> as only one peer can put his name to an amendment under that procedure i did so last week <e> <s> we had not expected that the use of this procedure set out in standing orders as a means of inviting the house to put on record a particular point of view in assenting to a bill would cause so much concern on all sides but it did <e> <s> i rapidly came to the conclusion that it would be counter-productive to persist and regretfully i withdrew the amendment <e> <s> well-worn platitudes come to the rescue on such traumatic occasions and what began as nothing ventured nothing gained ended up as discretion is the better part of valour <e> <s> i comfort myself retrospectively by thinking that one lives and learns even at the age of <e>", "<cs> my lords it is nearly eight years since i was chairman of the bbc <e> <s> much in this debate carried me back to the kind of issues i had to wrestle with all too frequently <e> <s> before i say a little about them i should first like to thank my noble friend lord bonham-carter who battled with me in the bbc <e> <s> i echo most strongly what he said about the proposed broadcasting standards council <e> <s> it is either very silly or very dangerous <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble lord lord donoughue who i thought showed an unusually extensive understanding of how the bbc actually works <e> <s> finally i should like to thank the noble lord lord annan who has saved me from saying a number of things that i wanted to say by saying them much better than i could have done <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to endorse the comments made by a number of members of the committee <e> <s> i went to edinburgh university as an englishman and came back years later as an adopted scotsman <e> <s> the scottish universities are indeed different <e> <s> the whole education system in scotland is different <e> <s> all these kinds of bodies are dominated by the south-east of england and i hope profoundly that they will indeed include a scotsman <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for his response <e> <s> it has certainly helped my thinking and no doubt that of others as we approach report <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to make one small point <e> <s> i am well aware of the complexities and difficulties of the tenure problem <e> <s> it has not existed for all that long in the cast-iron way in which it exists in some universities at present <e> <s> indeed it exists only in some universities and not all <e> <s> on the other hand if things go as planned in the bill universities will have a rather considerable internal injustice because tenure has an actuarial value <e> <s> we shall end up with people who have tenure because they have been in post for a while and others who have been appointed more recently or have been promoted and do not have tenure <e> <s> there will be a situation unless the government do something about adjusting salaries where people doing the same job are on a different contract or a different salary <e> <s> that is already giving rise to a good deal of unease <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that my noble friend lord bonham-carter initiated this debate even if i am sad that it should have needed to be initiated <e> <s> there is a need for such a debate <e> <s> we have heard a wide exchange of views and a great deal of wisdom and i particularly congratulate my noble friend lord annan who knows much about broadcasting <e> <s> if i do not agree with everything that he said i certainly agree with a great deal of it <e> <s> i agree or disagree variously with what other speakers have said <e> <s> because my noble friend lord annan and others have expressed their views so well many of the points i had intended to make have already been put forward <e> <s> therefore i have reached the conclusion that although there are a few points i shall make later i should perhaps speak about a few recollections of my time at the bbc which are relevant to the subject of our debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i think like every noble lord who has spoken that we owe a great debt of gratitude to the noble lord lord nelson of stafford and his committee <e> <s> i am sure that its report must rank as a classic among select committee reports <e> <s> if the government adopt its recommendations one cannot <e>", "<cs> my lords i see the noble lord lord denham looking a little uneasy <e> <s> i did not mean to provoke minutes of discussion <e> <s> i thank those noble lords who have supported our amendment <e> <s> i should also like to thank my noble friend from edinburgh days <e> <s> he was a noble friend because he used to advise me in those days <e> <s> sometimes i took his advice and sometimes i did not <e> <s> this time i genuinely thank him of the points he has raised <e> <s> one needs much more time to discuss those issues <e> <s> i did say that i did not think any amendment could guard against undue bureaucratic interference <e> <s> i doubt whether such interference is legally definable <e> <s> to that extent the amendment in the names of the noble lord lord adrian and myself is intended as a marker <e> <s> it could be said that it does not advance the cause one iota but does it follow from what the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has said that the phrase in clause of the bill which lays down that the national curriculum should promote <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor a question <e> <s> is not the need for clause connected with the recent scandal of the university college of cardiff where the principal refused to accept the advice of the ugc and therefore made his institution bankrupt <e>", "<cs> my lords verbose waffle or depressing as i called it does not matter <e> <s> i am sad <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may echo on behalf of the cross-benches the thanks that have been given to the ministers <e> <s> i could not conceivably have contained my patience for as long as they did <e> <s> much of what i wanted to say about the universities has already been said much more eloquently than i could have said it by the noble lord lord beloff and so i shall he brief on that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords as it is my amendment which is being amended for the second time if not possibly the third i should like to say straight away that i warmly welcome the governments amendment <e> <s> it does exactly what we wanted and it is phrased much more elegantly than was ours <e> <s> not only do i welcome the amendment but so i discover do my noble friends lord beloff and lord halsbury who added their names to it and the noble lord lord adrian who regretfully must be in the middle east <e>", "<cs> my lords it is perhaps characteristic of cross-benchers that they do not know which way they are pointing <e> <s> as different speakers have held forth i have found myself leaning to both left and right <e> <s> however after a good deal of thought i think i lean primarily in the direction of my noble friends lord adrian and lord beloff <e> <s> my difficulty is that i agree very much indeed with the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> the way that the government threaten to and on occasion have held up publications is deplorable <e> <s> it is not something that any charitable foundation would ever dream of doing <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say a brief word welcoming the amendment of the noble lord lord skelmersdale <e> <s> i do not think i understand these matters but in so far as i do i feel it is reassuring to the people who are worried <e> <s> i thank the minister also for taking note of what was said in this house <e> <s> i am particularly glad that he will write to the university world and explain we hope in words of not too many syllables and in a friendly manner just what it is all about <e> <s> the majority of research workers in the universities or anywhere else do not have the faintest idea what their rights are and it is just as well that they should know <e>", "<cs> my lords once again as a cross-bencher i find myself in agreement with the noble earl lord russell and the noble lord lord trafford <e> <s> i wish to make one small point <e> <s> it may arise from this bill or from some other bill <e> <s> i should like to remind the government of a famous saying of the late president truman of the united states <e> <s> i do not know the exact background which led him to say it <e> <s> however he said something that is of high relevance for a secretary of state his department a government and the whole of society <e> <s> he said get the facts or the facts will get you <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall also be brief <e> <s> everyone seems to be nice to the minister and i too should like to be nice to him <e> <s> he has done what i have to say ministers sometimes do not do <e> <s> earlier i quoted president truman <e> <s> i remind your lordships of what john henry newman said about this which we were edified to hear from the noble lord lord st john of fawsley during our proceedings on the education reform bill <e> <s> he said that it was a matter for praise and encouragement rather than reproach when a government listened and altered their view <e> <s> i find it pleasing that the government have done so <e> <s> i am sure that my fellow cross-benchers agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot help looking back somewhat nostalgically to the days when a white paper was a white paper <e> <s> i also rather dislike the gloss outside and in a different sense of the word inside as well <e> <s> what are they trying to sell us <e> <s> it makes me suspicious <e>", "<cs> my lords nothing has cheered me more in this debate than to hear the noble lord lord beloff commenting on the junior minister responsible for higher education <e> <s> i too keep a sharp eye on what that gentleman says <e> <s> in consequence i was puzzled to read in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry <e> <s> will the house allow me one more minute <e> <s> in short i hope profoundly that the government will cease to rely on the wholly inadequate figure of per cent <e> <s> return when the real return on the research of universities supported in part by the ugc and the research councils looks more like per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> if we express that as a percentage of the total expenditure on universities it comes out at as much as per cent <e> <s> research being about one-third of the whole <e> <s> it looks rather as though universities could be returning to society at large per annum up to half their total cost <e> <s> can the government find any better bargain than that <e> <s> are they not foolish in the extreme to try to get it on the cheap and to smother it with <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall make only the briefest of comments on the amendment of the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> i am very much in favour of it <e> <s> it aims to get rid of a manifest anomaly and injustice and i am persuaded by the arguments that the noble lord deployed at earlier stages <e>", "<cs> i am troubled by the amendment <e> <s> in saying so i declare an interest of sorts <e> <s> some years ago the noble lord lord rothschild and i spent a great many hours looking at and experimenting on the process of fertilisation <e> <s> this did not involve human eggs or human sperm there was little of that in those days but eggs and sperm which looked extremely like human eggs and human sperm though in fact they came from an invertebrate animal <e> <s> both of us spent many hours watching under the microscope and carrying out a variety of experiments <e> <s> we discovered a good many things which go on in the early stages but i shall not give the committee a biological lecture on that <e>", "<cs> i know that the time of pm has been bandied about as a moment when something might happen <e> <s> i shall be very brief <e> <s> for most of my life i have been a scientist but i shall not talk about the science of this problem <e> <s> others have done that and can do it much better than i can <e> <s> very tentatively and with some apprehension i want to voice an amateur thought about the logic and the morals of this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am troubled because i do not think that noble lords have picked up what the noble lord lord walton said <e> <s> undoubtedly there are facets of the matter which require a qualified medical practitioner <e> <s> but there are rather few medical practitioners who would be happy with for instance testing the fertility of human sperm and the storage and keeping of embryos <e> <s> a number of such activities need highly skilled scientific treatment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to say a word or two about what i conceive to be the real justification in the governments mind for the bill before us <e> <s> they spell out a number of times in the white paper of that they claim and i shall in some degree dispute this that the social return that is to say the financial advantage that a graduate receives in terms of his increased earnings is far higher than the financial return that a university receives on producing a graduate <e> <s> there is an appendix and an annex devoted to that <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to give your lordships the results of some calculations which i have done though they may well be wrong <e> <s> i do not have my calculator with me <e> <s> i have done a little mental arithmetic <e> <s> i was considering what i would have thought if i were in charge of this scheme in the days when i was principal of edinburgh university <e> <s> i do not believe for one moment that it could be carried out for less than about minutes per student and probably a lot more <e> <s> edinburgh university had students so that is minutes per annum <e> <s> that equals hours which is weeks something like eight-man years would be involved each year <e> <s> it would have involved quite a lot money as well as a lot of wasted time by intelligent people <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree with what the noble lord lord thomson and the noble baroness lady birk have said about the amendment to which i was glad to add my name <e> <s> the amendment is essential if the government are not to generate a great deal of ill will towards themselves <e> <s> i say that as an erstwhile chairman of the bbc <e> <s> i remember well the volume of <e>"]
