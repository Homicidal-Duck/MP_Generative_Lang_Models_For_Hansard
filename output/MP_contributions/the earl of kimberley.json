<e> <s> is he aware that last july which i agree was not in the time of this government discussions were taking place between the department of health and social security the home office and the treasury over the disposal of these funds <e> <s> secondly is he aware that the national and medical councils on alcoholism are charitable bodies <e> <s> therefore if the brewers society and the licensed victuallers association have given their blessing to donating per cent <e> <s> to charity would this not cut down public expenditure by having the two alcoholic councils subsidised by that instead of by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him this he said that rolls-royce were uncertain that there was a market for the <e> <s> by the present speys and jtds will not be allowed to land at any airport but there are over of these in existence today <e> <s> therefore i should like to ask the noble lord whether he would not agree with me that there is a market for a new quiet dry engine of this thrust and power <e>", "<cs> my lords while my noble friend is referring to the rb may i ask whether he has any news about japan forming a consortium with rolls-royce regarding production of this in bristol <e>", "<cs> my lords if much improvement following the agreement does not occur would the government consider suggesting that the western countries ought to boycott the olympic games in moscow <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that we are way down the list of

four years <e> <s> does he not agree that it is time the brewers society proposals were put into action <e> <s> further does he not agree that some of the money should go towards rehabilitating the unfortunate alcoholic in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord wells-pestell and hope that my new position is better <e> <s> this increase in the problem has been caused partly by general ignorance of the illness coupled with a reluctance to recognise the scale of the problem <e> <s> the services for the sufferer and the family are still inadequate <e> <s> in industry both management and the trade unions do not very often recognise the problem drinker <e> <s> in i suggested that some proportion of the tax revenue from drink should be earmarked towards helping to meet this nationwide disaster which let us face it costs us millions of pounds in shoddy work accidents and absenteeism <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall sum up very briefly <e> <s> i am most grateful to all noble lords from a variety of walks of life who have participated in the debate <e> <s> i consider that those who have taken part represent a very good cross-section of the community <e> <s> i must agree with what the right reverend prelate said about young people drinking what he called the hard-stuff <e> <s> as the right reverend prelate said drink may be more expensive now than it was before the war but on the other hand wages have gone up <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say what is the governments policy towards the russian factory ships which are at present sitting in falmouth

caledonian were allowed to operate in competition with british airways on domestic routes the services improved out of all recognition <e> <s> would he not therefore agree that competition on the

time there was a pirate whose biography was written by james thurber <e> <s> the pirate hated the letter o as his mother had been drowned when his ship sank as she was stuck halfway in and half-way out of a port-hole <e> <s> this pirate owned an island and he ruled over it very benevolently but because he hated the letter o he had it abolished from the alphabet <e> <s> this made life very difficult for courting couples as i love you became ilveyu <e> <s> it was even worse for a girl called ophelia oliver as her name became phelia liver <e> <s> the inhabitants finally rebelled and the

the warsaw pact countries which may perhaps encourage the russians or the soviet union to expand in the south and the east would my noble friend consider that it might be worth negotiating with south africa to reopen the naval base at simonstown <e> <s> secondly would he consider it perhaps pertinent to get together with some of our western allies to help china with modern defence equipment <e>",

which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that not very satisfactory answer may i ask whether he would agree that the decision by the dutch

say that if by chance in the near future there is a debate in another place about this we may be able to have a debate on this subject again in your lordships chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend for that answer may i ask whether he is aware that these broadcasts portray the soviet union in such a favourable light that they actually extol the virtues of communism and as a result help to persuade certain people to support the olympic games in moscow <e> <s> secondly is it not time that the whole of our country supported our prime minister and the president of the united states in these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that answer may i ask whether he is not aware that about two years ago there was a debate in your lordships chamber about doing

months for this to be reported in the free world <e> <s> thirdly does not my noble friend agree that if the russians used chemical warfare in afghanistan and it took months to find out this was much too late <e> <s> we must try to find out now <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships house as usual should be very grateful indeed to my noble friend lord kinnoull who has put his finger on a very important topic tonight perhaps i should say on two because he seems to be an equal expert on live fish and mechanical birds <e> <s> there is one point which he raised about which i would like to ask my noble friend straight away it is whether he could give us some information as to when the licensing deal with mcdonnell douglas ceases <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend a question

helicopters which would exclude the united states time is of the essence <e> <s> furthermore is he aware that if the eh aircraft is to be launched we should achieve around per cent <e> <s> of this market <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for that answer <e> <s> is he aware all things being equal that if the american torpedo was built it would do the united kingdom industry an industry which has been built up very successfully by sting ray a lot of harm and furthermore it may damage sting rays export potential <e> <s> secondly would he agree that in the past decisions to buy american conventional weapons have often proved to be much more expensive than originally anticipated and also that any offset work in the united kingdom has often been very disappointing <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that the ever-increasing anti-trident

said they did not have any money <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend said that ufos had been officially reported or acknowledged by the ministry of defence in may i ask him how many of those

enlarge upon it a little and say whether the royal naval reserve is being increased <e> <s> perhaps we shall be in dire need of them very shortly <e> <s> can he perhaps give some firm figures for the territorials <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that a few weeks ago a seminar on civil defence was held by the all-party defence group and that a report of the proceedings at that seminar

ask him two questions <e> <s> if hardship could be proved would that rule be allowed to be waived <e> <s> also is it possible for my noble friend to elaborate on whether there are any further benefits which the unhappy widow would be unable to obtain <e>", "<cs> my lords would not my noble friend agree that even if an agreement were reached with argentina that they should pay us reparations they might be in the position of being unable to pay because they have very little money and that therefore it would be very nice if they owed us a debt and were in our debt which would keep us in a slightly stronger position <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend not agree that the situation in gibraltar has changed a lot in the last two years <e> <s> if the inhabitants of gibraltar had a ballot today as to whether they wanted the frontier opened the answer is that they probably would not <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that answer may i ask whether he would agree that the uproar that this decision has created in the national trust largely engineered by professor hutchinson a leading light of the cnd is not a great example of the cnds promotion of unilateral nuclear disarmament through pseudo-objectivity <e> <s> would he further agree that the same technique is used by the working party report of the church of england of which canon paul oestreicher last years vice-chairman of the cnd is a member <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend not agree that the time has come to regard some of the organisers of the so-called peace movements as being openly hostile to our own country as well as to the whole of the western alliance <e>", "<cs> my

friend not agree even if the intermediate range missiles were cut down to on each side that bearing in mind that the soviet missiles have three warheads this would make a difference to to so there would not be parity <e>", "<cs> my lords if this experiment is to last for a year can my noble friend say whether the similar experiment of traffic lights at hyde park corner which is a complete disaster is also going to last for a year <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> can he tell me when the new civil defence legislation will come into being <e> <s> will he also give an assurance that councils will comply with the new regulations or that the government will

the cnd who are not friendly to this country should be recognised on future occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that the warsaw pact suggestion that there might be a freeze on nuclear weapons is just another ploy on their part in the hope that we might delay siting cruise missiles in our country <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had many diverging speeches on the subject of grenada today <e> <s> to me as a layman it appears that for reasons best known to itself the foreign and commonwealth office may seem prepared to wash its hands of british influence in the few

why the governor general did not include great britain in his cry for help the other day <e> <s> my noble friends lord home of the hirsel and lord soames elaborated on that point <e> <s> it is interesting to know that in a conference in washington on th and th october last year the secretary of state mr schultz said that the united states would not seek to foment violent unrest in communist countries but considered it a responsibility both moral and strategic to meet the call for help from those seeking to bring about change <e> <s> the appeal from the organisation of eastern caribbean states under its treaty is to me directly in line with that statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not particularly including the cia in this subversion work <e> <s> every country has its equivalent of the cia <e> <s> i was merely stating that countries which can fall prey to repression by the soviet union usually get stamped on <e>", "<cs> my lords i will happily tell the noble lord lord kennet

this anti-americanism that does us so much harm occurred when the shadow foreign secretary mr healey virtually accused mrs charles the prime minister of dominica of not telling the truth <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house is grateful to the noble lord lord jenkins for his question tonight because possibly the air may get cleared a little before the end of the question and perhaps quite a number of erroneous impressions which have been circulating not just in this house but throughout the whole of the united kingdom may get cleared <e> <s> much as i thought that the noble lords argument was extremely good i am afraid that i do not agree with very much of what he said <e> <s> however i was extremely pleased that both noble lords deplored what had happened to my right

kents talks <e> <s> he spoke for minutes and he spoke remarkably well <e> <s> in those minutes he laid at the feet of everybody in that room about people that everything that had gone wrong in the

lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> may i ask him first whether he agrees that the adam smith institute policy would suggest that the nimrod awacs could be replaced by a lightweight awac force <e> <s> would he not agree that perhaps the airship could fill that role <e> <s> secondly since research and development is very necessary would he say that there was any possibility that the ministry of defence and/or the department of trade and industry might be able to help towards this so that the contractors could supply the right sort of craft <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like

also for wool although i am not very knowledgeable on sheep farming matters <e> <s> then one could consider the rest of agriculture <e> <s> there are trees which will grow in areas such as the falklands with modern methods of aboriculture and i am sure that is worth pursuing <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say for how long the americans keep a one dollar bill in circulation <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not agree that the soviet union was bound to leave the talks in geneva when cruise and pershing missiles arrived in europe because they could not lose face due to
