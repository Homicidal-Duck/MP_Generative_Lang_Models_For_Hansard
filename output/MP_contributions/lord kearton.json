["<cs> my lords perhaps i may begin by expressing my appreciation for the kind remarks which have been made by my predecessors in this debate when they referred to my baptism in your lordships house <e> <s> it was an inspiration as the noble lord lord gregson said to sit under the chairmanship of my noble friend lord sherfield in conducting this quite complex inquiry <e> <s> it was also depressing as i believe was stated in paragraph of the report to realise as the witnesses answered questions that the future was slipping from our grasp <e> <s> we were in fact contemplating the further decline in both european and british strength <e>", "<cs> my lords it was a privilege to sit on this committee under the chairmanship of my noble friend lord rochdale <e> <s> as he said it is a complex subject <e> <s> he guided the committee through it brilliantly and i think his exposition tonight has been a model of lucidity <e> <s> the very complex questions have been put fairly before your lordships and the reasons for the recommendations of the committee have been very clearly and concisely explained <e> <s> the support he has had from my noble friends lord rhodes and lord tordoff make it i think unnecessary for me to do more than to say that i warmly commend the conclusions of the report expressed as they are in the form of opinions <e>", "<cs> my lords in my closing remarks i hope to be brief <e> <s> i should like to thank all those noble lords and particularly those noble baronesses who have spoken so eloquently in the debate <e> <s> my noble friend lord flowers must feel gratified by the wide approbation his report has received <e> <s> everybody congratulates lord flowers <e> <s> it is literally a report without price <e> <s> it could be that arrangements should be made to price it at a much higher level than did the stationery office and then to make arrangements for complimentary copies to be sent to the miners unions and to all people who take a legitimate interest in this question because the object of the commission as has been stated is to inform to instruct to guide and to put us generally on the right path <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my good fortune immediately to follow my noble friend lord torrington and to congratulate him on his superb maiden speech <e> <s> he has demonstrated in this speech his very powerful analytical mind his great knowledge of the industry and the extraordinarily constructive comments that he always has to make on very complex subjects <e> <s> i was one of the many on lord kings nortons sub-committee f who learned a great deal from my noble friend lord torrington <e> <s> it is customary to say on these occasions that we all hope that the maiden speaker will speak much more frequently in future <e> <s> this is certainly the case with my noble friend <e> <s> in this house i have noticed as a sometime attender that either the very young or the very old speak best and those of us in the middle do not speak too well <e> <s> i think my noble friend lord torrington although no longer in the very first flush of youth is one of the younger speakers whom we would like to hear very much more <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me great pleasure to support the motion moved by my noble friend lord halsbury <e> <s> i cannot hope to match his eloquence but then i think very few of us can <e> <s> in addition my lords i pray for your indulgence for what i have to say i am speaking as one who has had some years association with atomic matters and in fact an active association until months ago <e> <s> at various times i have had the privilage of serving under my noble friend lord plowden and my noble friend lord sherfield when they were chairmen of the atomic energy authority and i think the house needs no reminding of what a vitally important and valuable contribution lord plowden and lord sherfield made in the early development of atomic energy in this country a development to whose success the noble lord lord hinton of bankside has paid tribute <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my good fortune and privilege immediately to follow the noble viscount lord hood and to congratulate him on a superb maiden speech <e> <s> not only was it lucid and most elegantly expressed but it was based on practical matters and on a lifetimes practical experience <e> <s> the house is very much indebted for the contribution which the noble viscount lord hood has made to this debate and i am sure the whole house will join with me in hoping that the noble viscount having cracked his duck as it were will now frequently take part in debates in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not a member of sub-committee d nor have i any interests to declare other than those of a consumer and taxpayer <e> <s> i must <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow my noble friend lord tanlaw in saying what a privilege it was to sit on sub-committee f under the chairmanship of the noble lord lord kings norton <e> <s> the noble lord is a very shrewd chairman with a gift for getting the very best out of his witnesses and keeping his colleagues under the closest of close <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a pleasure to sit on any committee under the chairmanship of the noble lord lord kings norton <e> <s> he conducts his committee through very complicated documents with briskness and efficiency and always comes to a firm conclusion <e> <s> the report on the carriage of goods by road is no exception <e>", "<cs> my lords it was a privilege to sit on sub-committee b under the chairmanship of the noble lord lord greenhill <e> <s> we dealt with a complicated subject <e> <s> we had masses of documentation and masses of statistics but the noble lord lord greenhill of harrow steered us through this maze with calm efficiency and courtesy which it was really an education to experience <e> <s> the way in which he brought out the best in all our witnesses was also something which betrayed his long experience in the diplomatic field <e> <s> it was also a pleasure to be here for the maiden speech of the noble lord lord kaberry <e> <s> the noble lord lord kaberry was not only eloquent but he demonstrated by his comments that he had actually read the report <e> <s> at least he had certainly read the part of the report which dealt with textiles and he made some extremely interesting comments on it <e>", "<cs> my lords it was a privilege to sit on sub-committee b under the chairmanship of the noble lord lord brimelow to deal with the distribution servicing and pricing of motor vehicles <e> <s> in my view lord brimelow got to the heart of the matter and i warmly endorse the report its summary and conclusions <e>", "<cs> my lords as all members who served on the committee have already said it was indeed a privilege to take part in this investigation under the chairmanship of the noble lord lord gregson <e> <s> his acuteness the depth of his knowledge his patience and his persistence were quite extraordinary <e> <s> the investigation was very thorough <e> <s> there is a list of those who gave evidence mostly written some verbal <e> <s> there were about organisations <e> <s> they included industrial commercial and financial undertakings the trades union congress the universities many professional bodies research councils trade associations the ministry of defence etc <e> <s> seventeen witnesses gave verbal evidence and as the noble lord lord richardson and others have said were very closely questioned <e>", "<cs> my lords may i offer my congratulations to the right reverend prelate the bishop of durham on his eloquent and very thoughtful speech <e> <s> i was also most impressed by the deep understanding he showed of the aims of science and technology and of his sympathy with those aims <e> <s> the optimism he brought in his conclusions was most welcome and like the noble baroness lady elles i trust that we shall have the pleasure of hearing from him many times on a variety of subjects in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i can be brief <e> <s> i should like first to thank once again the members of the subcommittee who must be very pleased that the report has given rise to such an interesting wide-ranging and comprehensive debate <e> <s> i should like to thank all noble lords and baronesses who have taken part in the debate <e> <s> speeches have been powerful and eloquent <e> <s> finally let me say how much i appreciated the concluding speech of the noble baroness lady young <e> <s> i think that she covered an immense amount of ground and was most positive and constructive <e> <s> what she said together with the speeches of sir geoffrey howe over the past months have convinced me that the government are moving forward towards a closer european union i say this to the noble lord lord thomas of swynnerton however one defines that phrase <e> <s> i think that we are getting there and i can only say that i hope we get there quickly <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my good fortune to be the first member of your lordships house to congratulate the noble lord lord butterworth on a remarkable and noteworthy maiden speech <e> <s> the noble lord lord butterworth speaks from great experience and with great insight and great wisdom <e> <s> i was particularly struck by his references to the new courses started at warwick to bring engineering design up to the best computational standards <e> <s> it is a programme of which i have some knowledge and in it warwick university under the noble lord lord butterworth broke new ground new ground of a kind which is most important to the future well being of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin by congratulating the noble lord lord clitheroe on his thoughtful and constructive maiden speech <e> <s> like other noble lords i very much hope that we shall frequently hear him in this house <e> <s> the name clitheroe has certain significance for me because nearly years ago one of the first chemical plants for ici with which design i was associated was built at clitheroe to make catalysts for chemical processes and i think that that plant much improved is still there <e>", "<cs> my lords the afternoon wears on and i shall be brief <e> <s> i first add my own congratulations to those of my noble colleagues to the noble lord lord strathclyde for his very interesting eloquent and constructive maiden speech <e> <s> if i may say so it was very beautifully delivered <e> <s> i had the privilege of knowing his grandfather <e> <s> in fact it was his grandfather who told me that a strath was scots for valley <e> <s> i did not know that before <e> <s> i may say to the noble lord lord campbell of croy that i am ignorant in these matters but that was the case <e> <s> i am sure that the first lord strathclyde would have been very proud of his grandson had he heard his contribution here today <e> <s> we all very much hope to hear more from him in the days to come <e>", "<cs> my lords as a member of sub-committee f i had the privilege to serve under the chairmanship of the noble viscount lord torrington <e> <s> his chairmanship was at once strong subtle and decisive <e> <s> the fact that a fairly large committee arrived at a unanimous report is a tribute of the skill with which he guided us <e> <s> i feel rather like the noble lord lord sherfield in saying that my contribution can be very brief in that i stand behind the recommendations of the report <e>", "<cs> my lords in winding up the discussion i should like very sincerely to thank all those noble lords who have taken part in the debate <e> <s> i should particularly like to refer to the noble lord lord plumb whose contribution was so powerful <e> <s> we are delighted that he has appeared here to make his maiden speech and we look forward to many more speeches from him on european affairs in particular <e>", "<cs> my lords coming ninth in the list of speakers i find that most of the things i might have said have already been said more powerfully and more effectively <e> <s> however there are one or two considerations which it may be worth while to draw to the attention of your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord sherfield i welcome the thrust of the governments white paper <e> <s> i hope that when acost is fully functioning its deliberations are fairly transparent so that we know not only the results of its discussions but also the reasons for its decisions <e> <s> although the government accept the thrust of the report of the select committee it is very coy on the question of finance <e> <s> the hamburger customer would say the bun is very nice but where is the beef <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me great pleasure to support my noble friend lord nugent in his plea for rospa <e> <s> i had the honour to be president for some years <e> <s> rospa went through a very bad patch about years ago <e> <s> it was then a very worthy organisation but very unprofessionally run <e> <s> on his appointment years ago the present director general transformed the whole running operation and the morale and effectiveness of rospa <e> <s> like the noble lord lord nugent i do not think its reputation has ever stood higher than it stands at present <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that most people in north buckinghamshire regard milton keynes as a great success story not least because of the efforts of the noble lord lord perry of walton in establishing the open university so successfully there <e> <s> also is he aware of the vast amount of both domestic and foreign investment in commercial and industrial enterprises <e> <s> can the minister tell the house how much private investment has been made in milton keynes <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may begin by paying tribute to the chairmanship of the committee by the noble lord lord nelson <e> <s> it was a long arduous and exacting inquiry <e> <s> without the noble lords inspired leadership we should often have been bogged down <e> <s> as previous speakers who were on the committee have said his guidance and good humour took us through a major task <e> <s> we are all grateful to him <e> <s> i should also like to echo the tributes paid by the noble lord to our two specialist advisers sir john butterfield and professor walter holland <e> <s> as a lay member it would have been impossible to have played a constructive role in the committees work without the guidance and help that those two expert and remarkable men gave to us <e> <s> as the noble lord said we and the house are deeply in their debt <e>", "<cs> my lords just to wind up i express my sincere thanks to all those members of the committee who spoke with such authority thoughtfulness and eloquence in fleshing the skeletal account i gave of the contents of the report <e> <s> i should also very much like to thank those members of the house who were not members of the committee who made such a powerful contribution to the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all those who contributed to the debate <e> <s> at the beginning i expressed the hope that the debate would be both informative and instructive <e> <s> it has indeed proved to be just that <e> <s> we have had a remarkable range of speeches of great depth <e> <s> all aspects covered in the report have been touched upon by the different speakers <e> <s> we had from the noble lord lord bruce a contribution which if i may say so we have come to expect but we are none the worse for that <e> <s> i should like to thank in particular the secretary of state for his thoughtful constructive and positive reply to the points made in the report <e> <s> he left me and i am sure the whole committee satisfied that he representing the government is moving in the <e>", "<cs> i wish to support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord shepherd <e> <s> i had the honour of serving under him on sub-committee b as he said the report had the unanimous support of the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak to the amendment to which i have put my name <e> <s> as a member of sub-committee b i should like to support the amendment of the noble lord lord shepherd which he moved so eloquently and if i may say so so reasonably so reasonably in fact that i cannot imagine that any responsible minister could possibly disagree with the case that he put <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> i would say to the noble lord lord renton and the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes that sub-committee b received evidence from small producers that the cost of electricity was doubled by the anomalies of the rating system <e> <s> despite what the noble lord lord renton said the present situation has meant that small producers are very unfairly discriminated against <e> <s> the sole purpose of the amendment is to ensure that that does not happen in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords the trade unions are organised essentially on a company basis <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister care to modify an earlier answer <e> <s> with reference to the treasurys circular the general government expenditure during the s was as follows in per cent in per cent <e> <s> and continuing with per cent <e> <s> per cent <e> <s> and so on <e> <s> the rise took place during the s and was per cent per cent <e> <s> continuing with per cent <e> <s> per cent <e> <s> per cent <e> <s> per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> is it not true that only within

experience of japanese as well as of world affairs <e> <s> i should also like to thank the minister for his very comprehensive reply to the points made in the report <e> <s> perhaps i may also respectfully congratulate him on the way in which he delivered his speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot speak for the committee because those developments have arisen in the past few days <e> <s> my comments referred to my own views <e>", "<cs> my lords in making the final remarks in this long debate perhaps i may first thank the noble earl for the tone of his comments in his summing up of the various points made <e> <s> the impression gained by me is that there is an enormous amount of common ground on all sides of the house as the minister said <e> <s> we all seem to be agreed on targets <e> <s> the exact way in which we attain them is still under discussion <e> <s> in other words it comes down to tactics now and not to strategy <e>", "<cs> my lords i also add my voice in support of the amendment <e> <s> i very much agree with the points made by the noble lord lord adrian in regard to medical students and also the points made by the noble lord lord rea <e> <s> with the noble lord lord rea i was a member of your lordships select committee which visited america during its inquiry into medical research <e> <s> in company with the noble lord lord flowers i am currently on the committee dealing with the future of heart research in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the excellent work being done by the eastern european trade council under the
