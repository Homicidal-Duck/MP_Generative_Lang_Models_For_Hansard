<e> <s> her majestys government have no plans to widen eligibility for the occupational pension <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the total of pension and allowances received by a war widow depends upon the circumstances of each case <e> <s> however the main difference between the widows of those killed in service in and in is that only the latter are assured of receiving a pension under

a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords we have calculated that this order will sustain up to jobs in the defence industry over the next four or five years <e>", "<cs> my lords i assume the noble lord is referring to the recent discovery of a technical defect in one of the royal navys nuclear-powered submarines following which a programme of inspections of all such vessels has been set in hand as a prudent precautionary measure <e> <s>
