is an important alternative <e>", "<cs> following on the exchange between the noble and learned lord the lord advocate and the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey it seems that the only justification the government have for rejecting the amendment is fear of a few bent solicitors <e> <s> the police obviously already have the power to delay informing anybody else almost indefinitely

thought that was far more important <e> <s> if by some mishap the amendment is not accepted will the lord advocate indicate whether the government may be prepared to accept at a future stage an amendment to clause to provide that not only should the time of the detainees arrival at and departure from the police station be recorded but also the time at which his solicitor was informed <e> <s> that would at least help us to monitor how this is working in practice <e>", "<cs> can the noble and learned lord say whether in principle the government would be prepared to consider favourably an amendment to clause on the lines that i suggested so that after a year or so one would be able to gauge how the legislation was working in practice <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to speak on this

labour liberal and cross-benches and even to some extent from the government benches turn out to be so much eyewash the government have absolutely nothing to lose by accepting the amendment because

wish these clauses to be deleted from the bill <e> <s> i therefore cannot see any reason why the amendment should not be accepted <e>", "<cs> does the noble earl not agree that when this house voted to abolish the death penalty about years ago to the best of my memory it was the conservative party who proposed and voted for a five-year trial period <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether the government have given any consideration to the idea of levying stamp duty not on the purchase of property but upon its sale as is done in certain other countries <e> <s> this considerably

that somebody who owns a semi-detached pair of houses and lives in one should be required to allow the tenant to repaint the exterior of the adjoining one any colour he likes <e> <s> it may seem a trivial point but it seems to me to weaken the whole concept of private property rights <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for what he has said <e> <s> i think that the government probably

far as i know never before in history have private tenants been given the right to do more or less as they wish with someone elses property on the basis that the consent cannot be unreasonably withheld <e> <s> of course i take the point that it all hinges on the concept of what is unreasonable <e> <s> i think that possibly my amendments to clause might cover the point rather better and we

estates ablaze with colour and so on <e> <s> of course this is a magnificent idea but i was not talking about council estates <e> <s> i was talking about private individuals and this is a totally different matter <e> <s> if the government had excluded private tenancies from this clause there would have been no worry at all but for the first time in history so far as i know they are giving private tenants the right to make these very wide-ranging improvements to which the landlord is virtually forced to agree unless he has extremely good and rather narrow grounds upon which to object <e> <s> my lords this is a matter of principle and i am afraid i cannot withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is time that somebody from these benches rose to support this amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord bellwin mentioned priority and cost <e> <s> i wonder whether your lordships realise how minuscule the cost of accepting this amendment would be compared to the cost of subsidies to householders by means of tax relief on mortgage interest and subsidies to council house tenants <e> <s> the combined cost of the latter two that is to say subsidies to council house tenants and tax relief on mortgage interest amounts to no less than times the cost of this scheme if we take the figure suggested by the noble lord lord banks of million <e> <s> but even if we take the figure of million suggested a few months ago by the noble baroness lady young it is still times the assumed cost of the scheme <e> <s> furthermore if we accept the extremely well reasoned contention of the noble baroness lady faithfull the net cost of the scheme would be far lower because of the saving in the payment of supplementary benefit and rehousing costs so your lordships will see that the disparity is even greater <e> <s> i hope therefore that you will support this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely accept the last part of the noble lords statement <e> <s> it was inevitable in a bill of this complexity that there should be some accidental criss-crossing and it was kind of him to make that apology <e> <s> however i am saying to him that the loophole should not be closed because the point is that this is a loophole which is freely available to people who want to go into it with their eyes open and to take advantage of the same facilities as are available to them when they wish to buy flats on short leases knowing full well that they are buying a wasting asset <e> <s> it seems extraordinary that a party which so bitterly opposed the act and i have a mass of quotations to prove this should apparently have changed their mind in a surreptitious way <e> <s> i rather feel that they should have been more open about it <e> <s> if they were wrong in should they not say so openly now <e> <s> obviously i have no prospect of changing the governments mind on this so i must beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord very much for what he has said <e> <s> in fact it appears that lawyers are not wholly agreed that section of the act does have the effect that he says it has <e> <s> this is the difficulty about it <e> <s>

lords i should like to support the government on this amendment <e> <s> may i point out to the noble lord lord strabolgi that if this amendment were carried and an owner-occupier were living in his house at the time that this part of the act came into force if he were subsequently posted abroad on a three-year contract and if he wanted to let his house on a shorthold tenancy while he was abroad he could not do so <e> <s> so if the noble lord lord strabolgi reflects upon that perhaps he would think again about pressing the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not terribly keen on this amendment for the following reason <e> <s> in practice most landlords are only too happy to retain a good tenant or even an average tenant because the problems involved in switching tenancies are considerable <e> <s> the trouble is that there are many ways in which a tenant can be a bad tenant without specifically breaking the terms of his tenancy agreement <e> <s> therein lies the difficulty <e> <s> however if acceptance of the amendment would lead to bipartisan agreement on shortholds then i believe that despite my misgivings it would be worth accepting <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord bellwin and the government very much for this amendment which will avoid accidental unfair retrospection which i know the government would not wish to embark upon <e>",

parliament or elsewhere is contrary to the traditions of a free society <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble viscount explain why it is considered perfectly all right for labour <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to support this amendment for which the noble lord lord

that explanation <e> <s> i am not entirely happy with it but i should like to think about it again between now and the next stage <e>", "<cs> i readily acknowledge that the amendment as drafted has flaws but i do not accept that they are fatal flaws <e> <s> i take some of the points made by the noble lord but i think he has overlooked subsections and which introduce that degree of flexibility

situation where most of the electors in a given local authority area do not pay any rates or pay rates which are so heavily subsidised as to be negligible in practice you do not get that control in a fair way <e> <s> of course i would not think of pressing the amendment tonight but i want to take it back and look at it again before the next stage <e> <s> at the moment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should intervene briefly because i was one of the few noble lords on second reading to come out in favour of these charges and <e>", "<cs> i am unhappy about the

place on second reading but it did take place upon an amendment which was effectively a wrecking amendment if the amendment had been carried the bill could not have received a second reading <e> <s> following that division the bill received an unopposed second reading <e>", "<cs> my lords as we appear to be speaking on three amendments i should like to support the noble baroness lady birk in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> when we discussed this clause in committee i drew attention to the evident unfairness in the governments intention not to grant relief in respect of domestic properties which remain vacant <e> <s> the noble earl lord ferrers talked about sticks and carrots and said that this was the necessary stick to induce landlords to let empty properties <e> <s> however it has been drawn to my attention since then that in a commons reply on th may the minister mr tom king said that the government had reached the conclusion that this was not an effective way of inducing landlords to let which seems to contradict entirely what the noble earl said in committee <e> <s> for that reason i am reinforced in my contention that this claim is unfair to owners of domestic property and certainly so far as amendment no <e> <s> is concerned i hope that the government will think again <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord bellwin for having given what

purposes in this country as he himself said it cannot be applied quite across-the-board <e> <s> as he said there are a small number of local authorities which are likely to cock a snook at the

intervene in view of the compromise amendment no <e> <s> which i have tabled and which follows immediately upon the one that we are discussing now <e> <s> as i have made clear at earlier stages i take

sending out of proxy forms <e> <s> if he cares to check with my speech made in committee he will see that i specifically mentioned that i was well aware that it was not the law and that it was merely a stock exchange requirement <e> <s> the noble lord went on rather to contradict himself by referring in some detail to section of the act which as he said imposes obligations upon companies as regards proxies <e> <s> it makes it an offence punishable by a fine of to send a proxy form to some shareholders but not to others so to that extent the law already concerns itself with to quote the noble lord the detailed administration of company affairs <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> is he aware that a conservative member of parliament the honourable member for paddington who is a former assistant prison governor wrote recently that the conventional suspended sentences had been a failure <e> <s> following on from that because it is generally acknowledged that the first month of imprisonment is the most traumatic if convicted prisoners were sent to serve the first three or four weeks of their sentence in prison and were then released to return to their normal occupation knowing that if they put one foot wrong they would be back to serve the rest of their sentence would this not have a much more dramatic deterrent effect and therefore have the effect of lowering the prison population overall <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that interesting reply which reveals that this bulky net is essentially set to catch foreign nationals rather than united kingdom citizens <e> <s> can the noble lord say for what reason foreign nationals or non-patrials are detained when embarking approximately how many are prevented from leaving the country in the course of an average year and what percentage that number represents of the total number of people leaving this country <e> <s> secondly is it not true that any foreign national seriously wishing to evade immigration controls has only to travel from the united kingdom to the republic of ireland and if that is the case is not this whole paraphernalia of controls on embarking passengers

in todays debate proposing instead to wait until the bill reached the committee stage <e> <s> however since that time there has been evidence in the press of what appears to be a skilfully concerted campaign and i am certainly not accusing anyone in this house of being involved in it to bamboozle the public together with those members of both houses of parliament who are not closely in touch with

the question of child safety it is not to change the subject <e> <s> i shall have quite a bit to say about clause which deals with children wearing scat belts in committee i would only say now that if it goes through unamended it will effectively outlaw that valuable institution known as the school run whereby parents living in a certain street or a certain village take it in turns to pile five six seven or eight children into their cars and run them to school each day <e> <s> the abolition or the virtual abolition of this useful custom will involve many tens of thousands of parents in

death of a hunger striker and that bbc s newsnight allocated no fewer than out of minutes to this event <e> <s> furthermore at least three-quarters of those chosen by the bbc to comment on this matter were broadly sympathetic to the hunger strikers whereas for example the young mother brutally murdered by the ira in londonderry a few weeks previously while collecting census forms received very little attention or sympathy by comparison <e> <s> does the noble lord not agree that this is deplorable <e>", "<cs> my lords are there any comparative figures for deaths caused to motorcyclists cyclists and pedestrians before and after the introduction of compulsion given that there is evidence from new zealand that subsequent to the introduction of seat belt compulsion fatalities and serious injuries caused to motorcyclists and pedestrians went up quite sharply possibly as a result of over-confident or careless driving by motorists who had been led to believe that wearing seat

legal limit of alcohol in his bloodstream at the time who not only had his prison sentence suspended for somewhat inconsistent reasons but was banned from driving for a mere months which of course is no longer a ban than that which is applicable to very much less serious offences <e> <s> would the minister agree that such short periods of disqualification for killing people unlawfully not only have little deterrent value but are perhaps something of an insult to the families of the victims <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister say why when the government have a majority of in another place they are still evidently intimidated by minority pressure groups and why in view of majority public opinion they do not introduce a government bill to bring the english shops act into line with the far more liberal and more appropriate acts prevailing in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i must start by declaring an interest albeit a technical one <e> <s> i happen to let a number of houses and cottages but i am happy to let them at less than the market rate for what might be termed conservationist reasons if that does not sound priggish <e> <s> in other words i prefer to let them to village people at a so-called fair rent rather than let them to commuters who may be willing and able to pay the full market rent which of course is generally higher and sometimes considerably higher <e> <s> so this bill if it becomes law would scarcely affect my position one way or the other <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the most reverend primate for giving us an opportunity to debate this important subject <e> <s> the constraints of time necessitate concentration upon one or two aspects only of this complex problem <e> <s> i therefore intend to concentrate on the appropriate punishments for crimes of violence <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the amendment <e> <s> i must declare an interest both as a trustee and as a direct landlord although the acreages involved are modest in each case <e> <s> for the government to accept the amendment would not mean that they were condoning the breaking of existing contractual agreements freely entered into although in passing i must say that even if it did mean this it would not be the first time that a conservative government condoned a breach of existing contractual agreements <e> <s> the recent <e>", "<cs> is the noble earl

grenada <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble lord say whether the use of water cannon might not have saved many police and indeed pickets from injury <e>", "<cs> although i was here for only part of our second reading debate on this bill i subsequently read from cover to cover the <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that in a civilised world self-determination should be the main consideration to be taken into account when determining sovereignty and that whatever happened or did not happen years ago does not alter that principle <e>", "<cs> surely this conservative government

from the question asked by my noble friend lord allen of abbeydale is the minister aware that according to a report in <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that the report demonstrates that the habit of smoking is times more likely to lead to premature death than is the habit of driving a car without wearing a seat belt <e> <s> can he therefore explain why smoking remains legal and quite rightly so whereas driving without a seat belt has been made illegal <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate the noble lord lord broxbourne on his elegant and able maiden speech <e> <s> i do so with all the more pleasure because a great many years ago my family owned land in the village from which his title derives <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness lady jeger pointed out this amendment appears to contain a printing error <e> <s> is there any way that we can rectify that at this point or do we have to let the amendment go through as it stands and put it right on third reading <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> surely most of us whatever our political affiliation or lack of affiliation would endorse the maxim if there is one thing worse than public monopoly it is private monopoly <e> <s> if this amendment or something very like it is not agreed to then i fear that a private monopoly or at best a private duopoly is what we are likely to end up with in the long term at the expense of the consumer <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that if the average persons time is valued at a modest an hour and if people were delayed for up to an hour and a half which may be an underestimate the cost to the general public of this demonstration is in the order of million in lost time alone to say nothing of the cost of air pollution from exhaust fumes and of petrol wasted by engines ticking over <e>", "<cs> may i make a committee stage point on subsection of clause of this bill <e> <s> would the minister be so kind as to explain why it is only organisations concerned in terrorism and connected with northern ireland which may be proscribed by the secretary of state by order <e> <s> what about terrorism connected with scotland wales or the middle east for example <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the minister a question about clause <e>", "<cs> if i might help the noble lord the minister as i understand it the home secretary in the normal way has no power to ban citizens from the common travel area and he may have difficulty in banning the entry of citizens from other ec countries and possibly the commonwealth <e> <s> but it appears that the acts of terrorism referred to in clause <e>", "<cs> i shall of course write to the noble lord if he is unable to satisfy me on this point can the home secretary exclude from entry to this country someone from the irish republic who had been concerned with terrorism elsewhere in the world than in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> i have great sympathy with what the noble lord lord fitt has just said but would not the cases which he described he covered by the words without reasonable excuse in subsection <e>", "<cs> could the minister say whether as a possible compromise one could insert at the end of this clause <e> <s> no prosecution shall be brought under this section without the consent of the director of public prosecutions or the northern ireland equivalent <e> <s> would that be a possible safeguard that would merit support from all quarters of the committee <e>", "<cs> is it really the case that aircraft hijacking would be embraced by subsection of clause as it stands because subsection of clause limits the acts of terrorism covered by this clause to acts of terrorism connected with northern ireland affairs <e> <s> so unless the aircraft was hijacked by the ira or the inla it would not be included in subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs>

to per cent and to propose a <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to have to take issue yet again with the noble lord lord bellwin for whom i have the greatest respect and who has done a truly magnificent job this evening in defending with all sincerity what many of us with equal sincerity believe to be the indefensible <e> <s> i fully take his point about garages but surely the effect of the amendment as drafted would be to enable tenants to purchase at a large discount houses with gardens or with land attaching of as much as two acres <e> <s> from looking up the act that would be the effect of the amendment <e> <s> of course there may not be many local authority or housing association houses with as much as two acres of land attaching but certainly in rural areas there are many council houses

enfranchisement <e> <s> the british property federation as i understand it from my brief conversations with them take the view that if a conservative government with a truly massive majority an almost unprecedented majority in the house of commons turn out to lack all sympathy for the very genuine problems of property developers then there is absolutely no point in entering into large urban development schemes ever again as any subsequent government that we are likely to have are likely to be even more unsympathetic towards the problems of property developers <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> the government defend their extension of the principle of leasehold enfranchisement on the ground that the principle has already been accepted <e> <s> this is only true

the complexity of this bill is such that i did not fully grasp what the noble lord lord bellwin said in reply to an earlier question about the per year maximum ground rent which appears in paragraph of this schedule <e> <s> did i understand correctly that he was making the point that the british property federation had fears on this score over something called the holly lodge estate which were in fact groundless <e>", "<cs> despite the many reassurances given by the minister this afternoon particularly on such matters as the discounts applicable when a cheaper house than that which he or she already lives in is bought on behalf of the tenant under the scheme and which marginally improve the amendment in relation to how it originally appeared to a layman i am afraid that i still think that <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that the freedom of certain groups to demonstrate not in hyde park or some similar open space on a sunday but through the crowded streets of central london on a weekday in fact conflicts with the freedom of the vast majority of ordinary people to go about their lawful business without undue obstruction or delay <e> <s> are the government sure that

population of the falkland islands in considerable danger than the constant stream of pro-argentine propaganda emanating from certain quarters in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords if i cannot share the unqualified enthusiasm of most of your lordships for this bill it is essentially for three main reasons <e> <s> first as a strong supporter of the freedom of the individual i am naturally hesitant about any extension of censorship which i find as objectionable as i do seat belt compulsion the hysterical anti-smoking campaign to which we are currently being subjected or any other aspect of the nanny state <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord somers will have plenty of time to speak in due course if he will kindly allow me to continue <e> <s> for the same reason i believe even more strongly in the maxim that an englishmans home is his castle and i have over-heard a number of members of parliament express the belief that this bill as it stands does not go far enough and that the police ought to be given the right to raid the homes of private citizens if they suspect that an illegal video film is being shown or is even being stored there <e> <s> i do not suppose that any amendments to this effect would necessarily be agreed to by your lordships although having heard the noble earl lord attlee i am not so sure <e> <s> but i cannot help worrying that this bill or rather

scheme set out in clause were guaranteed to be no more than million in the first year and approximately million in the next couple of years as the government claim the amendment might not be quite so

the noble baroness lady birk for her support <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble lord lord bellwin for setting out his case <e> <s> he says that the governments intention is not to favour beneficiaries under this particular clause that it is not to give them any more advantage or subject them to any greater disadvantage than applies under the right-to-buy legislation generally <e> <s>

every tiny detail <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of allegations of arm twisting would the noble lord not agree that many if by no means all of the independents on these benches having carefully evaluated the arguments decided of their own free will to support the government both verbally and in the division lobby <e>", "<cs> as a pretty consistent proponent of the freedom of the individual i

the argument of the noble lord lord moyne proves if proof were needed the governments skill in arranging for these debates to be held so late in the evening <e> <s> this is not a party political motion as must be obvious <e> <s> nor is it an underhand tactical delaying motion as the noble lord lord houghton has explained despite the slightly cynical laughter emanating from the proponents of fluoridation when he said so <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has put me in something of a dilemma <e> <s> it seems that we are getting further and further away from democratic control over the whole issue <e> <s> to say that local authorities have no expertise in medical matters may well be true but we are talking about issues other than purely medical ones are we not <e> <s> it is a difficult point <e> <s> it seems to me that my amendment if accepted would not oblige health authorities to act against their better judgment <e> <s> they would have merely to pay rather more attention to representations made from whatever quarter than would otherwise be the case <e> <s> perhaps it is a matter of fine legal definition and a matter of <e>", "<cs> my lords i was hesitant about intervening in this debate following as i do so many distinguished noble and learned lords but i felt that i ought to do so in view of the many suggestions that have been made to the effect that parts of the bill if implemented would inevitably impinge upon the freedom of the individual <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am glad to support this amendment <e> <s> had i known before last friday by which time it was too late that this amendment was featuring on the list of amendments my name would have joined those of the noble lords lord tordoff and lord ardwick on the marshalled list <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that those of us with suspicious minds sometimes wonder whether the government do not actively encourage tourist coaches to park opposite the palace of westminster so as to prevent too many noble lords getting to the house in time to ask supplementary questions <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness not agree that the united nations is largely to blame for the present impasse in that to describe swapo in a partisan fashion as the sole authentic representative of the namibian people is much the same as describing the labour party as the sole authentic representative of the british people <e> <s> both are strong in the north of their countries but do not represent the whole nation <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord not agree that this whole affair would appear to be something of a propaganda stunt directed against turkey and to a lesser extent against britain in that nearly all turkish cypriots who formerly lived in the south and the west of cyprus have now gone to live in the north and conversely most greek cypriots who formerly lived in the north and north-east have now gone to live in the south and west and that thanks to the commercial drive and initiative displayed by the greek cypriots the economy is booming there are plenty of jobs available and that there is therefore no need for this couple to come to live in england <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord kilbracken for giving way <e> <s> i must say that i am very attracted by the simplicity of amendment no <e> <s> but sensing that almost certainly it will not be acceptable to the noble baroness lady vickers and the other sponsors of this bill i tabled amendment no <e> <s> by way of compromise a compromise which as i hope to show is actually rather nearer her point of view than the point of view of the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i think that it might be for the convenience of the committee if i were now to explain amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i believe that the amendment is not only superfluous but technically cannot now be moved by virtue of the previous amendment having been carried <e>", "<cs> in general i strongly support the amendment of the noble lord lord kilbracken <e> <s> i wonder whether he is aware that under section of the road traffic act a hovercraft is classified as a motor vehicle <e> <s> should not therefore the words left or disembarked from be added to the bill <e>", "<cs> if the noble baroness lady vickers does not wish to say anything perhaps this is the moment for me to reply <e> <s> i am of course well aware that the criminal law revision committee recommended the inclusion of subsection of clause into the bill <e> <s> but with all respect to the learned individuals concerned i wonder is they were right in doing so <e> <s> from the point of view of a layman i have always believed that justice must be seen to be done and it is often difficult for laymen to follow the reasoning of their learned brethren <e>", "<cs> i have listened with the greatest interest to the comments of noble lords in all parts of the committee <e> <s> i will first pick up the very interesting point made by the noble lord lord shepherd when he referred to the provision whereby judges can recommend that persons sentenced to life imprisonment for murder should serve a minimum term of imprisonment <e> <s> the trouble with such a provision from the point of view of public relations and its impact upon the public at large is that the minimum recommended sentence the period of time involved is expressed in net of remission terms rather than gross of remission terms <e> <s> therefore it does not have the same impact <e>", "<cs> my lords the trouble with the amendment of the noble lord lord mishcon is that the phrase sexual purposes is so incredibly wide-ranging <e> <s> my noble friend lord tweeddale has already given us the example of a young man who walks down the kings road propositioning girls of his own age <e> <s> i should like to give another example albeit a less attractive one <e> <s> let us suppose that in a city centre one new years eve shortly before midnight a drunken reveller steps off a bus staggers towards the first female reveller he sees and says ere luv give us a kiss <e> <s> she says shove off or words to that effect <e> <s> he then approaches another girl does exactly the same thing and gets the same response and quite rightly so <e> <s> this is undoubtedly offensive behaviour and not behaviour to be condoned but is it really right that it should be caught by this bill as would be the case if the amendment of the noble lord lord mishcon were accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support the amendment partly because it prevents a hideously ugly phrase from being incorporated into a statute and partly because it avoids the nonsense of trying to catch people who have just alighted from buses trams trolley buses if any still exist taxis or hovercraft <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord <e> <s> lord houghton has challenged me this is the moment i think for me to explain why i have added my name to the amendment <e> <s> i did so because it incorporates with one exception the essence of the amendment then amendment no <e> <s> that i was unable to move at committee stage last friday for procedural reasons but which received a great deal of support in all quarters of the committee <e> <s> the amendment now under discussion differs from mine in one way <e> <s> i admit to being slightly unhappy about the phrase <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i would explain to the noble and learned lord lord silkin that i did not draft the amendment <e> <s> i cannot see anything wrong with the wording but i simply added my name to an amendment that was already in existence <e> <s> i am afraid therefore that i cannot help him there <e> <s> so far as the noble lord lord mishcon is concerned this is precisely in essence the same as the amendment to which i spoke last friday <e> <s> i did not move it because his amendment no <e> <s> was carried <e> <s> however i spoke to it at length and received a great deal of support from various quarters of the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i may be able to assist the minister before he sits down finally <e> <s> the reason the concept of annoyance was not incorporated into the bill is simple <e> <s> the amendment of the noble lord lord mishcon was carried to include the word persistently and it was technically impossible for me to move my amendment no <e> <s> which included the words persistently or i underline the word or verbally ten times in a manner likely to cause <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord

think that will give us adequate time <e> <s> i sense that the general feeling of the house is that this amendment should be withdrawn at this stage but i reserve the right possibly to return to it at the next stage of the bill <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords because of the somewhat silly rules governing the time limits for private members bills in another place rules which do not allow adequate time for discussion and full deliberation between the various stages in each house of parliament we are forced to have what amounts in effect to a committee stage debate on these first two clauses in so far as the rules of the house permit which is rather confusing <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord give an assurance that if the word immediate is not included then only if people can see the offence or are within earshot of the offence only if those conditions prevail will there be any question of prosecution <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord again but he would agree would he not that the dictionary definition of a neighbourhood includes a region or a district <e> <s> that is a very large area <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness gives us a certain minimal reassurance in her description of the procedure which is normally adopted when the concentration exceeds milligrams per litre <e> <s> but she did if i may say so despite alleging that much higher concentrations are safe say that the normal figure was between and milligrams which seems to indicate that anything much in excess of that is considered unsafe

support all i can do is beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> unlike with the previous pair of amendments there are no technical aspects involved here to confuse the issue it is perfectly straightforward <e> <s> if there is danger to health there is danger to health if there is not there is not <e> <s> the noble baroness repeated the governments contention that fluoridation is an entirely safe procedure <e> <s> not for the first time i find myself wondering why the government do not have the courage of their convictions and accept this amendment <e> <s> it does not cost the taxpayer anything <e> <s> there is nothing in the amendment which would lead to extra cost or trouble for any of the parties concerned <e> <s> if they are really convinced that fluoridation is per cent <e> <s> safe and that no evidence is likely to come to light in the future to force them to change their mind what on earth do they have to lose by accepting the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disappointed at the reply given by the noble baroness <e> <s> her replies are quite often disconcertingly effective but this is not one of those occasions <e> <s> the examples she gave imply that my amendment would give the health authorities absolutely no discretion <e> <s> she implied in effect that my amendment is tantamount to saying that they must act in accordance with representations and so on <e> <s> that is not the case <e> <s> the trouble for the government is that they are hoist with their own petard because they have effectively conceded no less than three times within the past two months that the phrase have regard to which i suggest is as different as it can be from the phrase act in accordance with <e>", "<cs> my lords i am bound to say that i thought that the noble lord lord campbell had spoken because i jotted down what he said and i should like to reply to it <e> <s> he was talking about party manifestos <e> <s> many of his honourable friends in another place are extremely embarrassed and upset that this fluoridation has been sprung upon them and their constituents without warning

as the party least hostile of all the major parties to the concept of individual freedom <e> <s> now alas that perception has i think changed very considerably <e> <s> conservatives are now thought to

result of the by-election at brecon and radnor is announced <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down i wonder whether he could answer one question <e> <s> he suggested that those of republican sympathies in the north should be shielded so far as possible from symbols of the monarchy <e> <s> does he i wonder believe that the converse should apply in other words that those of unionist sympathies in the south such as remain should also be shielded from symbols of republicanism and if not why not <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not here at committee stage and i had no foreknowledge of these amendments which i saw for the first time only a few moments ago but i am delighted to know that the mind of the noble lord lord banks and my own mind have evidently been running along the same lines ever since the budget approximately four months ago <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i cannot possibly support the amendment it goes much too far <e> <s> inadvertently no doubt it brings private motor cars within the ambit <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to hear that <e> <s> however in case there is any inclination on the part of the government to accept the amendment there was a serious attempt in another place to include private motor vehicles i should like to say why i think this should not happen <e> <s> consider the case of a family consisting of a husband wife and

the children and a flagon of cider for her husband and herself <e> <s> the picnic is duly consumed in a lay-by <e> <s> the children polish off the cans of coke and lemonade but as cider is nowadays normally sold in litre size screw-top flagons the parents have no inclination to consume the whole bottle and the one-third of a litre that is left is duly repacked in the picnic case <e> <s> the

behold the handcuffs are snapped on metaphorically if not literally <e> <s> i do not think that this is the sort of thing that we would want to happen <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i briefly put one slightly different question to him <e> <s> he maintains that the negative procedure provides adequate safeguards <e> <s> just possibly it does but is it not the case that by convention your lordships chamber in contrast to another place has no effective powers when the negative procedure as opposed to the affirmative procedure is employed <e>", "<cs> i think it might be useful if

conservative back-benchers to say nothing of your lordships <e> <s> unless we can be assured that there was no back-door deal i hope that noble lords will support the noble lord lord tordoff in the division lobby <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask if he is suggesting that the government which sanctioned the sweeping licensing reforms in scotland a few years ago lost electoral support in consequence <e> <s> i am very sure they did not <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord finally sits down i wonder whether he can confirm that it was under the government of his right honourable friend mr harold wilson as he then was that scottish licensing laws were so drastically liberalised with such beneficial effects upon alcohol-related crimes <e>", "<cs> my lords to pick up a remark made by the noble lord lord mishcon so long is the queue of cross-benchers trying to get a word in edgeways that more often than not they need a drink more than most <e>", "<cs> my lords i strongly support this important pair of amendments <e> <s> the bill as presently drafted gives a future secretary of state quite alarming powers <e> <s> i stress the word future because while

sports ground as defined in the criminal justice scotland act and as essentially restated in this bill are extraordinarily sweeping <e> <s> sporting event means <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that the licensing laws ought to be the same north and south of the border <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i could not quite hear what the noble lord lord harris of greenwich said and

detract for a moment from the excellent opening speech made by the noble lord lord glenarthur <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for that reply <e> <s> would he not agree that in general the safer and more secure an individual feels the more relaxed and hence inattentive he becomes and the

help feeling not for the first time that northern ireland is being treated almost as a colony and a th century colony at that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i briefly point out that fish is expensive in the territory in question as it is in most islands nowadays for various reasons <e> <s> it is therefore not consumed to any degree by the population as a whole but only by the people who can afford it <e>", "<cs> we have become broadly accustomed over the years to government proposals <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly take up a point made by the noble lord lord campbell <e> <s> he pointed out that in this country a distinction is made between taking a motor vehicle without consent without authority and car theft <e> <s> that i entirely appreciate <e> <s> i was well aware of that <e> <s> the point i was trying to make was that in most countries as far as i know that fine distinction is not made for better or for worse <e>", "<cs> clause seeks to raise the minimum amount of criminal damage measured in terms of monetary value below which the offence is triable only summarily with a maximum possible prison sentence of no more than six months <e> <s> the clause does not seek to raise the minimum figure merely in line with inflation <e> <s> none of us i think would quarrel with that <e> <s> instead it raises it very substantially in real terms <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble earl that any limit that is set is of necessity an arbitrary one <e> <s> there will be this curious anomaly whereby if damage is over the top the maximum sentence of imprisonment rises fold <e> <s> that is a problem which we are always going to get <e> <s> all i am arguing is that in this instance the limit appears to be too high <e> <s> i am sure the noble earl will agree that it has risen way above the rate of inflation <e> <s> in the course of his answer he has corrected some figures of mine <e> <s> it is a little difficult when several acts are referred to to find out exactly when the limit became but certainly the limit is well above the rate of inflation <e>", "<cs> unlike the noble lords on the opposition benches i do not automatically take a lofty elitist scornful view of these amendments <e> <s> on the contrary although i have many criticisms of detail i sympathise with the concern of the noble viscount over these evil crimes and what is to be done about the growing incidence of them <e> <s> this concern undoubtedly echoes majority opinion in the country <e> <s> i do not think that anybody can seriously deny that <e>", "<cs> in common with distinguished noble lords on what i think we still call the alliance benches i gave notice that i would oppose this clause altogether because i believe the existing maximum penalties to be adequate but i am attracted by the amendment put forward by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> i think it represents a reasonable compromise between the position of the government and what one might call the liberal cross-bench position <e> <s> i would support the amendment if the opposition were to press it to a division <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for what he says about writing to me and i look forward to that <e> <s> he asserted that a -year maximum imprisonment for non-violent cruelty is not one whit too long i am sure that he agrees that violent cruelty is already covered by other statutes <e> <s> however the minister has not been able to explain if that is the case why the government who after all have been in power now for over eight years have left it at one-fifth of that level all that time <e>", "<cs> time and time again we have heard of the horrors and dangers of prison overcrowding and we have been warned of the absolute necessity of reducing the prison population in this country <e> <s> but here in this clause the government propose to raise the maximum prison sentence by a factor of no less than three and one half <e> <s> undoubtedly people convicted of the offence in question have been very naughty <e> <s> yet what is the point of sending wholly non-violent mainly middle-aged men to prison for several years at enormous cost to the taxpayer and imposing ever greater strains upon the prison system in the process <e> <s> much less wasteful alternatives are available <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the somewhat technical explanation given by the noble earl <e> <s> but he has said nothing about the suggestion of combining massive fines with short sharp prison sentences <e> <s> that still seems to me to be the answer for crimes which do not cause pain or suffering to individuals <e> <s> this applies not only to this particular offence but also to many others <e> <s> of course bribery and corruption are thoroughly undesirable practices which should be strongly discouraged <e> <s> but as i am making what is in a literal sense an after dinner speech i cannot resist pointing out that governments of all political complexions practise electoral bribery as a matter of course <e> <s> taxes are invariably cut in the year preceding a general election government contracts are awarded to firms with factories located in marginal constituencies and so on <e> <s> this occurs not only in the united kingdom but also in france the united states west germany and elsewhere <e> <s> indeed the entire common agricultural policy could be said to be one gigantic exercise in electoral bribery <e>", "<cs> i start by saying that my noble and learned friend lord wilberforce entirely supports my opposition to the clause <e> <s> most of us thought that the clause would be considered yesterday <e> <s> alas that was not to be and my noble and learned friend unfortuantely has other commitments this evening <e>", "<cs> the minister has pointed out that under the clause as it has been drafted the crime of insider dealing becomes an arrestable offence <e> <s> i think that is the strongest leg of his argument with respect <e> <s> the normal practice surely is to see how an existing law works out before changing it <e> <s> this law has only been in effect since st july and it is far too early to see <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter and to the noble earl lord onslow for their support <e> <s> in reply to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter i should like to have omitted the escape clause although the noble lord lord mishcon says it does not mean what the layman may think it means <e> <s> that may be so <e> <s> however i thought it would be better not to aim too high and to select an amendment which would be broadly acceptable to the committee and also to the other place which of course would have to examine this amendment if it were to be passed here <e> <s> he may be aware that a distinguished honourable friend of his in another place put down an amendment to increase the minimum disqualification to years <e> <s> that was not called by the speaker but there is certainly a body of thought in another place which thinks that my amendment is if anything rather on the soft side <e>", "<cs> of course the noble lord is absolutely right <e> <s> those are the people we should be thinking about first and foremost <e> <s> the noble earl lord caithness talked about penalties and perhaps i concentrated too much upon the punishment aspect <e> <s> but although i see this partly as punishment i also see it as a means of protecting other road users i really do not think that these sort of people ought to be on the road <e> <s> there is perhaps a case for saying they ought to be made to take another driving test before being allowed back on the road again after <e>", "<cs> i should like to take up the point made up by the noble and learned lord lord elywn-jones <e> <s> is the minister satisfied that the existing controls on crossbows are strong enough <e> <s> it is true that in the last session a successful private members bill circumscribed the acquisition and possession of crossbows by the under-s <e> <s> as far as i know there is no evidence that it is the under-s who are responsible for the misuse of crossbows which has occurred in various parts of the country over the past few years <e> <s> given that crossbows are a much more lethal weapon than any air weapon is there not a case for requiring them to be licensed in the same way as shotguns <e>", "<cs> i believe it was in the region of per cent <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lords lord hutchinson lord rea and lord pitt for their support <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord pitt put his finger on it <e> <s> i did not expect for one moment that this amendment would be accepted with open arms by the government <e> <s> but nor did i expect to be turned down so totally flatly a course which seems extraordinarily unreasonable <e>", "<cs> i was not talking about drugs at all <e> <s> i was talking about gold coins watches cigarettes alcohol and so on <e> <s> the customs are allowed to search people for all things on which duty has not been paid but the police are not allowed to search suspected jewel thieves for jewellery in this way <e>", "<cs> the committee has just rejected or at any rate deferred one amendment which would have promoted the freedom of the individual <e> <s> however i hope that the committee will look favourably upon this amendment because i believe it to be worthy of acceptance <e>", "<cs> the amendment has a lot to commend it <e> <s> i missed the first few sentences of the introduction by the noble lord lord meston but it seems to me that if we are to have what is in effect censorship at all in this matter and i am not at all sure that there ought to be censorship then it is only logical that all sexual assaults should be covered <e> <s> after all serious indecent assault involving forced oral sex for example can be every bit as shaming and traumatic as rape for the victim and her family so there is certainly logic in the amendment proposed by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> with regard to the intervention of the noble lord lord meston i do not really see where male chauvinism comes into it <e> <s> i understood that militant feminists were in favour of total parity for the sexes <e> <s> obviously there are several exceptions to that rule and this appears to be one of them <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord graham sits down he used the emotive words dirt and distress in talking about present betting shops <e> <s> i frequently have occasion to park near betting shops <e> <s> i have never heard any noise emanating from them <e> <s> i have rarely seen much dirt and certainly very little distress <e> <s> i wonder if he would care to elucidate a little more what he means <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether we could have some guidance from the government as to the merits or demerits of this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a most gratifying reply <e> <s> i should like to say how grateful i am to noble lords in all quarters of the house who have spoken in favour of the amendment and to the noble earl and the government for accepting it <e> <s> i think that the general public who have recently demonstrated such anguish and concern over this problem will also be very grateful to the government <e> <s> once again i thank the noble earl and all those who have supported the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i put my name down to this amendment because it expressed a feeling that i have had for some time <e> <s> i wonder whether the government would consider the provision of a modest and i stress the word modest degree of compensation to all those who are wrongfully arrested or detained and not only to those who are wrongfully convicted <e> <s> that would reconcile the public to the greater number <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble earl accepts that this amendment does not seek to change the current practice of the customs and excise in any way <e> <s> that answers the partial objection raised by the noble lord lord trafford <e> <s> all it seeks is enlightenment <e> <s> i would say that it stands or falls on its own <e> <s> the investigations currently being carried out by the right honourable member for the city of london and westminster south have no bearing upon this amendment <e> <s> it is perfectly obvious that it will be many months if not years before any legislation can result from that investigation given the crowded parliamentary timetable <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house it seems to me that it would perhaps assist the the government in their deliberations if the feeling of the house were tested now <e> <s> no <e> <s> very well <e> <s> i should like to say to the noble earl that the reason why i drafted the amendment in the way i did is that intimate searches are already covered by the police and criminal evidence act and therefore it seems superfluous to repeat that cover in this amendment <e> <s> however perhaps there is some technicality of drafting that i have missed <e> <s> with the noble earls at least partial assurance for the moment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as someone who believes like the great majority of people in this country that punishments for the worst examples of murder the hyde park and regents park bombings for example or the fordingbridge murders ought to be more rather than less severe i confess that i have mixed feelings about the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones for his valuable support <e> <s> he put the case for the amendment far better than i was able to do <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble lord lord harris of greenwich and also to the noble and learned lord lord hailsham for his partial albeit highly qualified support <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the minister for enlarging on his letter which was ambiguous in one or two respects <e> <s> he has stated that the statistics to be published will be on the general lines which i and other noble lords who supported my earlier amendment envisaged <e> <s> i am happy with that assurance <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord lord beaverbrook explain in connection with amendment no <e> <s> ac what is the legal position if the person attempting to seize the illicit recording was physically obstructed by the person in possession of that recording <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble and learned lord agree that with the exception of public figures important enough

objections made by the noble earl lord caithness <e> <s> i do not think in practice that they would come to very much because i cannot believe that many local government electors would vote in favour of the material which i described earlier <e> <s> however i think the whole issue needed an airing <e> <s> with that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> having made it clear earlier that i broadly support the government on clause i urge them to give sympathetic consideration to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am not so happy about amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i can understand the reservations of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter about paragraph a of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am not sure that i entirely agree with him but i can understand his reservations <e> <s> does he not agree that there can be no possible objections to paragraphs b c and d of amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> although i am still unhappy about certain aspects of clause even as it has been amended i agree with the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter and the noble baroness lady blatch that it would be quite illogical to exempt one medium and one only <e> <s> furthermore i do not think that the clause as it stands is quite the threat to the theatre that the noble lord lord jenkins and his supporters suppose <e> <s> i dare say that they have in mind the romans in britain as one of the plays that

think that noble lords need have any worries on that particular score <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord not agree that a local authority owning a theatre could not possibly be caught by the clause unless it were deliberately to put on something entitled for example a season of homosexual drama and advertise it widely as such <e> <s> unless it were to do such a thing it could not possibly be caught by the clause <e>", "<cs> i cannot agree with the noble earl at all because he would no doubt soon suggest abolishing the television licence <e> <s> that would be just as logical <e>", "<cs> i have no information <e>", "<cs> does not the noble lord agree that anyone who can afford to buy dog food can afford to buy a dog licence <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to disagree with my noble friend lord henderson but i largely agree with my noble friend lord halsbury <e> <s> i contend that amendment no <e> <s> would give us the worst of all worlds <e> <s> it would confine the restrictions which are to be imposed by clause solely to the question of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship whatever that curious phrase may mean <e> <s> thereby it implies that promiscuous homosexual relationships such as those which until recently were said to be found in the bathhouses of san francisco and new york in which men were said to have sexual relations with or different men every year are in some way preferable to stable quasi-family homosexual relationships <e> <s> given the aids epidemic that must appear to most people to be quite insane <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand everything which the noble lord lord ritchie is aiming for with this amendment and i have a certain sympathy with it <e> <s> i certainly agree with his criticism of the words pretended family relationship <e> <s> but i wonder whether the noble lord has his wording quite right <e>", "<cs> my lords until just over hours ago i thought that this amendment had everything to commend it <e> <s> after all it seemed a reasonable assumption that one could undoubtedly promote bisexuality in other words encourage people to try it out with those of the same sex so as to discover whether it was slightly more pleasurable or amusing than heterosexuality <e> <s> but one could not promote pure homosexuality if i may coin a phrase which is something one is either born with or acquires at a very early age <e>", "<cs> my lords i wholeheartedly support the amendment <e> <s> as i said when speaking to amendment no <e> <s> surely it is much better to encourage or at any rate to tolerate stable homosexual relationships than it is to encourage or tolerate promiscuous homosexual relationships which can do so much harm if indulged in to excess even leaving aside the question of aids and

<e> <s> as someone who unlike most of the governments critics today broadly supports the government on clause perhaps i may make this point <e> <s> section as it is to become will get off to a very much better start if the government could see fit to make just a few more concessions to those who rightly or wrongly are worried about this clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i have one reservation about

reasons for her wording and should like to enlarge the question to ask whether at least a brief act of traditional christian worship should not automatically be provided for all children unless their parents specifically request otherwise <e> <s> i say brief because it is counter-productive to bore children and i say traditional for reasons which i shall come to <e> <s> this has nothing to do with

can effectively be taxed at several hundred or even several thousand per cent <e> <s> because of the failure to index gains arising prior to st march <e> <s> does that not encourage investors to go

realise that i am in a minority in this chamber tonight but to my mind it is the greatest of pities that the government were not prepared to wait and see whether the extensive curbs which they have already and rightly imposed upon local government profligacy where it exists actually do the trick before hastening to abolish the rating system and substituting the community charge in its place

rather unfair if the property owner who has tried to sell the property but has not succeeded is suddenly faced with a large bill <e> <s> the government are protecting the person whose property is unsold after three months <e> <s> should they not give some albeit lesser protection to the owner whose property is unsold for up to six months <e>", "<cs> i fear i take a dissenting view <e> <s> is not one of the problems with the amendment that in many cases the adult children of the diplomats concerned live in their properties in the united kingdom <e> <s> it would be quite unfair if they were to be able to live at a very low effective rate of poll tax in what could be quite a large and valuable property <e>", "<cs> what is the position if the diplomat in question owns two homes in this country as many quite possibly do a main residence and a country cottage <e>", "<cs> what is the position if the diplomat in question owns two homes in the united kingdom a main residence and a country house or cottage <e> <s> would he pay the standard community charge in each case <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that one of the main factors pushing up the price of houses is the

give relief from the community charge where domestic properties are vacant for three months <e> <s> logically speaking therefore they should apply the same formula to industrial and similar properties

unfavourable treatment they receive in terms of tax rates and subsidies in comparison with their continental counterparts <e> <s> as the bill stands not only their land that is their vineyards but the buildings used in their business are to be treated as wholly agricultural bringing them into line with all other agricultural enterprises <e> <s> if that is not the case should this not be put right at a later stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> that is on the whole a satisfactory answer <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i should like to ask whether or not he is aware that lincolnshire county council to which the noble baroness lady stedman referred which is a conservative controlled council is run as an extremely tight ship <e> <s> i think that if there had been any economies which it could have made it would have done so <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the noble earl has answered the pertinent point made by the noble lord lord mcintosh which was also on my mind about teachers

doubtless without meaning to <e> <s> i have not got the brief with me but as i remember it was explaining why the government propose to exempt caravans from the provisions of the bill but not second holiday homes <e> <s> the reason was that whereas caravans depreciate in value houses appreciate <e> <s> houses as such depreciate in value albeit perhaps not as fast as caravans this situation is masked by the housing boom which we have now <e> <s> what appreciates is the site on which the houses stand <e> <s> without realising it the government have an excellent argument for site value taxation in their own briefing <e>", "<cs> i warmly support the amendment so ably moved by the noble baroness <e> <s> however i have to say that whatever the theoretical objections and i appreciate

transport will not reverse the decision unless we write the safeguard into primary legislation <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that point <e> <s> however does the minister agree that neither he nor his honourable friend in another place can possibly bind their successors <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne has made a very telling point <e> <s> theoretically we can vote down an order when it is brought in but in practice we hardly ever do <e> <s> i cannot remember the last time it happened it must be once every years or thereabouts <e>", "<cs> i pointed out last week that the supporters of this bill for all their good intentions do not seem to understand the ordinary day-to-day problems which are faced by parents <e> <s> it is all very well saying as my noble and learned friend did that <e>", "<cs> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> like the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne i do not think given the public opinion polls cited by the noble lord lord nugent that there would be a large number of parents going to the trouble of signing the declaration stipulated by the amendment <e> <s> those few who chose to do so would almost invariably have sincere and valid reasons for doing so <e> <s> for example their children might suffer from chronic or recurring conditions or even temporary conditions not serious enough to be

compulsion <e> <s> nor have i ever denied that on balance seat belts save lives overall <e> <s> the operative phrase is on balance <e> <s> seat belt compulsion may save lives just as vaccination saves

criticised the voting procedure set out in part iv of the bill at this time of the evening i shall concentrate entirely upon one or two aspects of part i <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister began by

shotguns have also been with us for a long time albeit for decades rather than centuries <e>", "<cs> before the minister sits down can he confirm that as the law stands at present the individual living in a block of flats in a city to whom he referred would be almost automatically entitled to a shot gun certificate unless he had a conviction or was deemed to be of bad character <e>", "<cs>

stand firm <e>", "<cs> surely the other answer to the noble viscount is that a rifle or a pistol has a much greater range than a shotgun and is therefore much more dangerous <e>", "<cs> i follow the

has been well made by the noble lord lord swansea <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down does he not realise that the power is already in the bill to add to the list of weapons to be proscribed <e> <s> if it can be added to why cannot it be subtracted from <e>", "<cs> my lords following strong pressure from government back-benchers in another place as i understand it the government effectively conceded albeit somewhat reluctantly that chief constables would not be allowed to deprive people of their shotguns without very good cause <e> <s> it is therefore surely essential that the amendment is agreed to if the government are not to break faith with their own back-benchers in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may briefly support this amendment and ask the government to look at the practicalities of the matter because unless the amendment is agreed to there is a danger that when an individual wants to acquire another gun during the currency of his existing certificate he will find it very difficult to do so <e> <s> people do not buy shotguns only upon the expiration of their existing shotgun licence <e> <s> that will make life very difficult in the normal course of events <e>", "<cs> my lords this may be an opportune moment for me to speak to amendment no <e> <s> which is a slightly less radical alternative amendment as regards the government to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the noble viscount lord mountgarret said that he was not very happy about the age limit <e> <s> i must congratulate him on the mildness of his phraseology <e> <s> many of us are extremely worried about the implications of government amendment no <e> <s> as it stands which is why we have tabled amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the trouble that the noble earl lord ferrers has taken in trying to defend a rather difficult position <e> <s> however there were certain inconsistencies in his reply <e>

is far less lethal <e> <s> but that perhaps is a minor point <e>", "<cs> my lords although the compensation provisions of clause appear on the face of the bill to be universal and all-embracing the parliamentary under-secretary surprisingly announced in another place on st march that dealers would be excluded <e> <s> that seems to he quite wrong and furthermore potentially subject to challenge

to our rather more complex but less ambitious amendment and simply have lengthened the period of time from three years to five <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what the noble earl says but perhaps i may remind him that the right honourable gentleman of whom i spoke when i introduced this amendment and who in was home secretary in the conservative administration wrote to mps in november of that year

amendment no <e> <s> if it is in order to do so at this moment mainly on the grounds that a pledge was given in another place that something along these lines would be introduced <e> <s> there was not time to do so <e> <s> now seems the right moment to accept such an amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in contrast i strongly support the amendment <e> <s> i hope that noble lords on the main opposition benches who quite rightly in my view are constantly calling for the replacement of the negative resolution procedure by the affirmative resolution procedure when other contentious bills such as the poll tax bill the housing bill and so on are being debated will remain true to their principles and support it in this case as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for listening so

constable would have given the parents a firearms licence in the first place <e> <s> as regards the propriety of introducing such a provision at this stage i said specifically at report stage that we

this amendment <e> <s> all of us whatever our widely varying views on the bill as a whole want the committee to succeed and stay in business for as long as necessary <e> <s> this amendment would not

trading laws and that if its proposals are adopted it will be the first time in over years that people will be imprisoned for selling bibles on a sunday <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to put a few questions to the minister <e> <s> i had not realised that these two quite different orders were being taken together <e> <s> i understand the reasons for requiring some products to be sold in metric

products which must be sold in metric units or to add the metric equivalent of products which must be sold in imperial units <e> <s> surely that is an unnecessary infringement of freedom <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord can answer one question <e> <s> he appears to be in favour of the broadcasting media being allowed to do whatever they wish without censorship of any sort <e> <s> logically therefore the noble lord should be in favour of the bbc and itv being free to transmit hard-core pornography and incitement to racial hatred <e> <s> is that really what the noble lord wants

perhaps inevitable pre-christmas confusion a printing error would seem to have substituted his name for mine on the list of speakers <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that as the noble lord lord molloy indicated a great many of the road traffic accidents which occur in built-up areas are caused by motorists taking their eyes off the road in a desperate attempt to discover where on earth they are <e> <s> therefore in addition to the problem with the department of transport signs will her majestys government make it compulsory for local authorities to ensure that the names of all

night and while reserving my position i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if the government do not wish to reply now i take it from their silence that they are prepared at least to

accept this amendment for the reasons advanced so cogently by the noble lord lord prys-davies tonight and for the reasons put foward by so many members of the committee of all political persuasions and none at the committee stage of this bill when we were discussing an amendment of my own that related to the definition of the word terrorism <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has not replied to my charge that the governments definition of terrorism in the bill excludes any question of intimidation <e> <s> earlier this evening i spoke to a noble lord who was a most distinguished qc <e> <s> he

amicable and satisfactory outcome as that resulting from my amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am staggered by the fact that the committee does not seem to have woken up to the essential illiberalism of

sentence in full in that foreign country so that for that country the slate is wiped totally clean should nonetheless be hauled before a court very probably after having been arrested beforehand as provided by subsection b in order effectively to be punished a second time for the same offence <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord graham for sharing my unease over this matter <e> <s> like him and the noble lord lord harris i fully understand the governments motives which are admirable i am just unhappy about the means they propose to achieve the end <e>", "<cs> from the point of

iron curtain <e> <s> this being so rules sometimes have to be bent not to protect the commercial interests of the united kingdom which is what some of the later clauses are concerned with but to protect the actual lives of the people of this country <e> <s> the important thing is that such bending of the rules as there may be is strictly proportionate to the danger faced in other words that it should not be excessive <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble lord is right in saying that the main purpose of defence is first and foremost to defend the united kingdom at home rather than abroad but i still hesitate about the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords important though the quality of our water supply undoubtedly is is it not a purely domestic matter which has nothing to do with creating a level playing field in advance of <e> <s> does the minister agree that our domestic water supply is no more a legitimate concern of the common market than our national health service the schools curriculum restaurant hygiene or speed limits on motorways <e>", "<cs> my lords unlike the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter i support this amendment even though i fully agree with him that the words a section of the public are extremely imprecise <e> <s> a section of the public could mean per cent <e> <s> or even per cent <e> <s> of the public <e> <s> that is fine but it could equally well mean one-tenth of per cent <e> <s> of the public which is a different matter altogether <e>", "<cs> i am partially satisfied by the noble earls reply but only partially satisfied <e> <s> he talked about our interests being endangered <e> <s> so much hinges upon the precise interpretation of the word endangered <e> <s> questions of interpretation have come up at earlier stages of this bill and again today <e> <s> if one could be sure that the full rigour of the law would apply only if the interests of this country were really endangered i should have no worries <e> <s> what makes me hesitate is the fear that the law might be used in a case of mere trivial disadvantage <e> <s> however i do not feel strongly enough about this matter to divide the house so i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lords who have spoken in favour of what the noble lord lord ezra rightly terms a modest amendment a modest question of shareholder protection <e> <s> i am very disappointed at the governments response as i leant over backwards to revise this amendment to make it technically perfect and to narrow it in order to exclude shareholders who are living outside the united kingdom <e> <s> i also said that i would not proceed with the other shareholder protection amendments which might have been slightly more controversial <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister or the government given any consideration to the desirability of establishing a standing advisory commission south of the border given that the position of the dwindling minority in the republic is not entirely satisfactory in all respects <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble lord lord cledwyn for initiating this debate <e> <s> some of the

support the government and to congratulate them on their common-sense in this matter <e> <s> i certainly hope that we shall not go on to central european time because we are not geographically part of

noble lord lord stanley <e> <s> nobody likes compulsory purchase but over the decades people have become reluctantly reconciled to it provided that it is the country as a whole or at least a substantial part of the country as a whole which benefits <e> <s> but it is a very different matter when one has compulsorily to make sacrifices for the benefit of shareholders in private companies

attainment of further integration of the ec without jeopardising either national interests or cultural identities not just britains would be a difficult and delicate task <e> <s> why therefore attempt the task one wonders <e> <s> it is not as if further political integration were a prerequisite for fostering friendship between peoples <e> <s> indeed the opposite may be true as i shall argue later

people were encouraged to learn japanese mandarin russian or arabic in preference to danish flemish or modern greek or even in preference to french german or italian desirable though the latter undoubtedly are from a purely cultural point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment strongly <e> <s> the noble earl lord radnor and the noble lord lord monk bretton have already given specific examples of how extremely unsatisfactory the present state of affairs is <e> <s> how much worse will it be when private profit-making companies are allowed to ride roughshod over farmers and other landowners both large and small including by the law of averages some perfectly ordinary householders <e> <s> what makes it even worse is that these are at present immense powers conferred upon non-privatised companies not quite as great as those conferred upon vat inspectors but heading that way <e> <s> the powers have been in existence for barely years and were not even preceded by an act of parliament with the full scrutiny of both houses which that would have entailed but instead the provisions were implemented by means of a statutory instrument <e>", "<cs> my

do not intend to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords irrespective of its detailed content this emerges from our deliberations as a wholly misconceived bill <e> <s> it is misconceived because it tackles the symptom rather than the disease and only one of the many symptoms at that <e> <s> the disease is the surplus aggression and violence of young males in this country <e> <s> the phenomenon is endemic in britain for a variety of reasons including the absence of national service in britain compared with the situation that still prevails on the continent the encouragement by the present government of the get-rich-quick property boom society at least until october with the consequence that a substantial segment of young people felt excluded from the alleged benefits of that society our inadequate and probably under-funded state education system and the virtual breakdown of discipline within that system and a breakdown of family cohesion of which the highest divorce figures in europe announced two days ago are only one aspect <e>", "<cs> although unlike the noble baroness lady turner of camden i support this bill on the face of it at any rate this series of amendments to clause seems very reasonable <e> <s> on the basis that it creates sweetness and light to give way to ones opponents from time to time on matters of lesser importance i hope the government will give serious consideration to this series of amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all noble lords who have spoken and in particular to the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon for his support <e> <s> the noble lord lord colwyn seemed to imply that this was an anti-fluoridation amendment <e> <s> it is not <e> <s> it is an anti-excessive fluoridation amendment <e>",

house will accept them <e> <s> they would merely restore the position to what it was years ago prior to as the noble earl reminded us <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord lyell will not i think expect me to give the same welcome to this bill as has been given by previous speakers nor am i able to do so <e> <s> anyone who criticises a bill the title of which begins with the innocuous sounding

parliamentary under-secretary of state for northern ireland while speaking in the standing committee in another place when he said that the word fair <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government given any

up their minds as to what is a right and proper fine it is unusual for the government to raise it by a factor of five but there we are <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to all noble lords who have spoken in support of this amendment in particular to the noble lord lord bonham-carter for his second intervention <e> <s> i listened carefully to the minister <e> <s> he made the point that unemployment is not a mirror image of employment <e> <s> sometimes it is and sometimes it is not <e> <s> to the extent that it is not an amendment of this kind is all the more important because one cannot deduce one from the other <e>", "<cs> i did not expect to get very far with this amendment nor indeed have i i am grateful to the minister for explaining that in his view it is extremely unlikely that a fine of

work out in practice <e> <s> with that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this has been an unusually interesting debate <e> <s> i turn first to the noble lord lord prys-davies <e> <s>

the case <e> <s> i doubt whether acceptance of this amendment would affect more than or people in the whole of northern ireland <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may first reply to the noble lord lord bonham-carter <e> <s> he stressed that there are no formal quotas in the bill <e> <s> that is true <e> <s> but goals and timetables the phrase in the bill inevitably lead to informal quotas <e> <s> if a firm is found to employ more of one group and fewer of another than the religious balance pertaining in an area of the province indicates the firm will be heavily leant upon for example to advertise job vacancies only in those newspapers read largely by members of the unrepresented group and so on until such an informal quota is attained <e> <s> it will take longer but the end result will be the same <e>", "<cs> further to what my noble friend lord dunleath has said i wonder whether the noble lord can explain precisely what the term on merit means <e> <s> does it mean purely academic qualifications <e> <s> does it mean length of service with another company <e> <s> or does it include those intangible qualities that most employers everywhere in the world look for in employees which may have nothing to do with academic qualifications and have everything to do with their good nature their ability to get on with other people and so on and so forth <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord mottistone arrived this afternoon i expressed concern about a similar provision in clause <e> <s> i echo his worries about this provision in clause <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble viscount lord brookeborough and the noble lord lord mottistone for their support of the principles of this amendment <e> <s> i am also grateful to my noble friend lord hylton for the first part of

jobs in the world where former membership of the security forces is absolutely vital for the effective carrying out of the job <e> <s> however there are a great many jobs where former membership of the security forces is extremely useful and desirable if not essential <e> <s> it is obvious from what has been said that what applies everywhere else in western europe and in most of the world cannot be applied uniquely in northern ireland because of the overkill aspects of the bill <e> <s> so many aspects of the bill represent overkill <e>", "<cs> i fully support amendment no <e> <s> to which i have added my name <e> <s> moreover i think that there is also quite a lot to be said in favour of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the purpose of amendment no <e> <s> is to put a very modest brake on the powers of the commission <e> <s> the commission already has very wide-ranging powers granted to it by specific provisions under the bill <e> <s> therefore to allow it still further powers powers which would be very much resented on the mainland let us not forget were they to be applied here in respect of religion race sex age politics or anything else under the vague category of any other special consideration is tantamount to giving the commission <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord hylton for his support <e> <s> what the minister said confirms my supposition that the essential thrust of clause is political and not religious <e> <s> in a way it is curious that amendment no <e> <s> is not grouped with this one <e> <s> there were some misgroupings earlier when amendments were grouped together which should not have been and now these two have not been grouped together when they should have been <e> <s> however it may well be that the amendment of the noble lord lord blease is superior to mine in various other respects and i look forward with interest to what he has to say <e> <s> for the moment i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for explaining the regulations <e> <s> the wording is extremely complex even tortuous <e> <s> i suppose that is inevitable <e> <s> perhaps i am particularly slow-witted this evening but i found the regulations difficult to interpret and i hope that the general public will not also find them so <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble earl lord swinton is absolutely right in suggesting that the other place will have to look at the drafting of the amendment <e> <s> while we are all agreed on the merits of the principles of the amendment i am convinced that the noble lord lord williams of elvel is correct in suggesting that the grammar is wrong <e> <s> so far as i can see one cannot secure a duty <e> <s> i am certain that the wording will have to be tidied up in another place <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord jenkin of roding sits down for the second time perhaps i may put one point to him <e> <s> the individual who seeks to buy his council house is far more likely to run into difficulties in practice if the local government officer with whom he has to deal is secretly rather than openly opposed to the sale of council houses <e>", "<cs> my lords notwithstanding the last two supplementary questions will the minister concede that the mappin webb building is far more pleasing to the eye than will be the building scheduled to replace it and for that matter far more pleasing to the eye than are the remains of the rose theatre <e> <s> with that in mind will not her majestys government have second thoughts bearing in mind <e>", "<cs> i also have reservations about amendment no <e> <s> standing in the name of my noble friend lady saltoun <e> <s> i prefer amendment no <e> <s> in the name of the noble baroness lady carnegy <e> <s> however there is no doubt that my noble friend has given powerful and cogent reasons for deleting subsection or at least drastically modifying it <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may put one question to him <e> <s> he favours a common retirement age of <e> <s> let us suppose that the average life expectancy for both men and women increases by five years over the next years which on past patterns may be something of an underestimate <e> <s> would he still then be in favour of the retirement age being as low as <e>", "<cs> my lords since the life expectancy of men is six or seven years shorter than that of women is the minister aware that on average men draw their state retirement pension for or years less than women despite making exactly the same contributions <e> <s> is this not grossly unfair and ought it not to be rectified as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the whole point of imposing common standards throughout the community is to facilitate the free movement of goods and services among the member states <e> <s> does he not agree that our domestic water supply has no international or cross-border connotations and it is therefore entirely unsuitable for intervention by the european commission <e>", "<cs> my lords one fully acknowledges the nuisance caused by some parties to local residents <e> <s> however does the minister agree that throughout history the younger generation has enjoyed shocking the older generation <e> <s> therefore the more hysterical the older generation becomes about so-called acid house parties the more stimulated will be the younger generation to try to attend <e> <s> is it not time that a sense of proportion was adopted towards this transient phenomenon <e>", "<cs> my lords following on from the intervention of the noble lord lord nugent does the minister agree that the eastern and western most extremities of the european community are just as far apart as the eastern and western most extremities of australia <e> <s> australia conforms to geographical realities in having three time zones and therefore logically the european community should do the same <e> <s> does the minister agree that the three time zones do not impede the efficient functioning of australias economy nor should they impede the efficient functioning of the economy of the european community <e>", "<cs> my lords as i was not here when we debated this matter in committee perhaps i may say that i strongly support the principle of this amendment whatever technical defects there may or may not be in the drafting <e> <s> i believe that it would be utterly immoral if landlords were allowed to pocket moneys paid to them by tenants in respect of rates which are no longer due <e>", "<cs> my lords having read with extreme care the earlier criticisms of the noble lord lord coleraine of clause made both at second reading and at committee stage i do at one level very much sympathise with him <e> <s> but on another level i have to point out that successive governments for almost years have interfered clumsily with the law of contract and with the rather more metaphysical law of supply and demand insofar as these laws relate to housing <e> <s> because of this any major shift in the law is bound to dash somebodys expectations <e> <s> those who have such hopes consider them to be legitimate but objectively speaking i do not believe that that can be so however much one may sympathise with those who are caught out <e>", "<cs> my lords having been rather lukewarm over the previous amendments moved by <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord rippon had not taken any care whatsoever to ensure that i was here <e> <s> however i was on the point of leaping to my feet to move his amendment in the absence of anyone else rising to do so <e> <s> it is a very sensible amendment <e> <s> the retail price index has increased a good deal more than five fold since whichever month in that year one happens to choose <e> <s> the amendment is therefore not only logical and sensible but if anything somewhat modest <e> <s> i am delighted that the government have moved it for us <e>", "<cs> my lords despite the criticisms of the prime minister emanating from the opposition benches will the noble lord the leader of the house agree that one cannot blame her for losing patience with commonwealth double standards <e> <s> so many of the commonwealths member states are either dictatorships one-party states with poor human rights records as was revealed in amnesty internationals report earlier this week economic rivals of south africa or in one case a state which officially discriminates against its large ethnic minorities in the fields of job opportunity and access to university education <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment for perhaps unusual reasons <e> <s> in principle i have always disliked social engineering legislation of this nature preferring that aims should be achieved by persuasion rather than coercion <e> <s> however if one happens to be one of those people who at present appear to be in a majority who approve of banning by law discrimination on the grounds of sex or race i do not see how it is either logically or morally possible to oppose banning discrimination on the ground of age <e>", "<cs> my lords i too must start

to amendment no <e> <s> i in turn take the opportunity to draw his attention to the fact that at least one of the corrections in a long list of corrections that has been supplied to us is itself in need of correction that is the correction to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i merely take the opportunity to mention that point now so that the government can correct the correction before we arrive at amendment no <e> <s> later this week <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that if the current per annum of subsidy to each higher rate taxpayer were done away with by limiting tax relief on mortgage interest to the standard rate of tax there would be plenty of revenue available for equalising war widows pensions and for many other desirable measures as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not

very commendably and very effectively encouraged an enormous growth in the number of small businesses in this country <e> <s> substantial numbers of redundant miners steel workers and others have been encouraged to start a new life by becoming self-employed which by and large they have managed very successfully <e> <s> does he not agree that it would be a tragedy if these people were driven to the wall by the high interest rates about which we have just been speaking accentuated by the unethical tactics of a few mainly monopsonistic large organisations <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord

they had been illegal the police would have acted long before now <e> <s> obviously i was mistaken <e> <s> of course one accepts the noble lords reassurances <e> <s> but in order to dispel the widespread impression that in the matter of free speech some are decidedly more equal than others can the noble lord assure the house that the police will be instructed automatically to protect meetings at which the right of free speech within the law is to be exercised from physical attacks by those whose aim is to extinguish such traditional rights <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that luxembourg has six seats in the european parliament whereas on a per capita basis it would have only one that the republic of ireland has seats whereas on a per capita basis it would have only six and so on and that in contrast the united kingdom france and west germany are under-represented on a per capita basis <e> <s> does the noble lord agree that it is quite unthinkable that the

gardner who speaks with such great knowledge <e> <s> i take the point made by the noble lord lord tordoff <e> <s> it is very difficult to get the wording right <e> <s> if one were to specify the

he reminded us the whole idea of giving tax relief for the private medical expenses of the over-s is controversial <e> <s> we have had reminders of this several times this afternoon already <e> <s> i for one certainly share those misgivings <e> <s> on balance i concluded that they <e>", "<cs> my lords my optimism in that respect has to be dashed then <e> <s> i hope that there will be time for the government to think again about it and to limit this tax rate to the basic rate of tax <e> <s> to do otherwise would be quite without merit <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i did not make myself clear enough <e> <s> i obviously did not mean that all medical conditions could be cured by an osteopath <e> <s> however i must say that in my experience and in the experience of a great many of my friends and acquaintances where injuries to the back limbs and joints have occurred ordinary medical treatment usually combined with physiotherapy has not worked on more than half of those occasions <e> <s> however whenever we have seen an osteopath he has generally within a short time cleared up the condition in question <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble viscount sits down may i ask him further to the reply he gave to the noble lord lord tordoff whether it is the case that if and when we reach the age of we shall have to exchange our present green and white driving licences for the new pink

out an excellent case for it <e> <s> we have to recognise that the united states of america in particular is claiming more and more jurisdiction over what goes on outside its own frontiers <e> <s>

incorrupt non-racial multi-party democracy could be created in south africa <e> <s> would the noble lord acknowledge however that such a democracy is an extremely rare phenomenon on the african continent and that we should not therefore entertain excessive expectations <e> <s> secondly would the noble lord agree that african tribal minorities and asian and european minorities have fared extremely badly on the african continent over the past few decades <e> <s> despite the undoubted good faith of mr mandela is it not the case therefore that minorities have every reason for

compensation out of their own pockets <e>", "<cs> my lords like thatcherite conservatives i am in favour of adults being encouraged to stand on their own feet <e> <s> one could only wish that the bill leant rather more in the direction of individual judgment and choice and rather less in the direction of paternalism <e> <s> however individual freedom of choice cannot be exercised <e>", "<cs> my

deceived into buying food or anything else which is not what it appears to be <e> <s> therefore i have no hesitation in supporting this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords quite apart from the fact that

principle forecast <e> <s> it is resented for a good reason <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the general public worries far too much about nuclear warfare and far too little about chemical warfare which is a more likely possibility and could be almost as devastating in its consequences <e>", "<cs> my lords it was significant that the question appeared on the order paper on a day when there were also two short debates <e> <s> the first dealt with the chaos prevailing in the market for rented farmland which led to the virtual drying up of that market as a result of

immune from political pressures generally in favour of inflationary policies particularly when countries such as greece are involved <e> <s> does he also agree that the supposedly olympian bundesbank has been leant on heavily by the west german government to hold down interest rates pending the unification of the two germanics even though on the basis of purely economic considerations a rise in interest rates would have been justified <e>", "<cs> despite the persuasive argument of the noble lord lord underbill i oppose the amendment <e> <s> if this assembly/parliament in which small

is no such act <e> <s> the word and is redundant <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not time that we abandoned the illusion that we can control the complex affairs of nations which are situated several hundred or several thousand miles away from our own country <e> <s> will the minister agree that realistically the best help we can give is come what may to maintain those oases of security and stability the british sovereign bases and in particular dhekelia which is the one part of the island where turkish and greek cypriots can meet on equal terms <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that non-committal reply <e> <s> does he not agree that the central issue is that the flat rate poll tax has transferred large sums of money from those who are only modestly well of f to those who are very well of f it is that specific aspect of the poll tax which nearly everybody in this country regardless of political affiliation considers to be unfair <e> <s> if only for the sake of self-preservation while the finance bill is still in committee in another place will the government not consider amending the bill so as to restore the relative net spending power of high and low earners respectively to what it would have been if domestic rates had not been superseded by the poll tax <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble earl says that community charge benefits are substantial

well structured <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord lord irvine for giving us the chance to debate this subject <e> <s> however i must confess that i too am somewhat perplexed as regards the precise significance of the prefix civil <e> <s> one knows that social justice is a subjective concept which bears little relationship to ordinary straightforward justice but until the noble and learned lord lord hailsham spoke i had imagined that there was no material difference between civil liberty and straightforward liberty <e> <s> however it seems that i may have been mistaken <e> <s> i agree with the noble and learned lord that even the use of the word liberty on its own is unsatisfactory <e> <s> it is a word that one tends to associate with rather grandiloquent transatlantic rhetoric which stems no doubt from the franco-american alliance of the late th century <e> <s> i shall stick with the good anglo-saxon term freedom <e>", "<cs> my lords anyone who rises to speak more than halfway through a list of speakers has two duties first to try to correct if possible errors of facts and judgment which one believes ones opponents may have made and secondly to advance any arguments for ones own side that have not yet been made <e>", "<cs> my lords at the beginning of my speech i suggested that the noble baroness lady <e>", "<cs> my lords a strong tide of public opinion against the existing boundaries has already been underscored by a number of noble lords notably by the previous speaker <e> <s> it is worth remembering that this is nothing new <e> <s> public opinion has always been against the idea of humberside <e> <s> that has certainly been the case south of the humber where i live <e> <s> i remember seeing opinion polls in lincolnshire

retract his words <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord yet again but i was speaking of the sixties in inverted commas not without inverted commas <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree that the duty of a minister of the crown is to propose policies that are best for britain in preference to any other political entity just as french ministers always act in the best interests of france <e> <s> that being so is not his right honourable friend to be congratulated on his speech <e>", "<cs> my lords given that per cent <e> <s> of nhs income already comes from charges will the noble baroness say whether her majestys government have considered levying a nominal bed-and-board charge on those patients amounting to approximately per cent <e> <s> of hospital in-patients who could well afford it <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that years ago the british and free french set aside their traditional commercial and cultural rivalries to fight side by side against a common enemy <e> <s> does he further agree that as today there is no common enemy naturally traditional rivalries must to some extent reassert themselves <e> <s> will he confirm that on a purely unofficial person-to-person level relations between the british and the french are probably better today than they have ever been <e>", "<cs> i am pleased to support the amendment which like all the amendments is practical and is by no means a wrecking amendment <e> <s> it merely brings more sense into the bill <e> <s> as the noble lord lord stoddart has said the amendment would exclude shetland ponies and most donkeys <e> <s> there are few donkeys which are higher than nine hands <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may take the opportunity to correct the assumption of the noble lord lord gisborough that horse does not include ponies <e> <s> if the noble lord will look at clause he will see that for the purposes of the bill horse includes pony <e>", "<cs> as the noble viscount rightly guessed i totally oppose the amendment for a number of reasons <e> <s> in the first place it is incompatible with existing personal safety legislation or nanny state legislation depending on ones point of view <e> <s> at the moment it is perfectly legal to drive a post- car on a private road without wearing a seat belt <e> <s> pre- cars can be driven anywhere without the driver having to wear a seat belt of course <e>", "<cs> we have had an interesting debate and i am most grateful to the noble lord lord mancroft for his support <e> <s> this was particularly valuable because of his extremely thorough knowledge of all matters equestrian and his great experience <e> <s> he also stressed the need for having legislation on the statute book that was enforceable so as not to bring the law into disrepute <e>", "<cs> i am not sure how much todays ministry of transport knows about horses <e> <s> i shall let that pass <e> <s> the noble lord lord boardman stressed the word permit <e> <s> the trouble is that the unfortunate owner has to prove that he did not permit it <e> <s> it is all very well for my noble friend lady masham to say that she sticks up a notice saying that people must wear hats <e> <s> that is possible in some cases but not in others <e>", "<cs> i do not think it is possible to prove either way unless there is something in writing about it <e> <s> if everyone has to produce a legal document to prove that he has urged riders of his horses to wear hats it will make the country more bureaucratic than it is already <e>", "<cs> i said at the outset that i was speaking to both amendments together <e> <s> i would not dream of pressing the first but not the second <e> <s> i hope that the noble viscount does not think that i would do such an underhand thing <e> <s> if that were the case it would be up to other members of the committee to press the amendment themselves <e> <s> of course the <e>", "<cs> i am slightly puzzled by my noble friends explanation of the amendment <e> <s> it seems to be at variance with the words of the amendment which imply that before drafting the regulations the secretary of state will take advice from the organisations concerned <e>", "<cs> can the noble baroness say whether it is proposed that sikh children should be exempted from wearing helmets <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i cannot withdraw my amendment <e> <s> if both houses of parliament thought it right that the affirmative procedure should apply to regulations governing the wearing of seat belts by children logically we cannot deny applying the same procedure to this bill <e> <s> it represents a more major change in the law because the front seat belt legislation was already in place when the rear seat belt legislation was passed <e> <s> therefore it was not such an innovation <e>", "<cs> as regards amendment no <e> <s> my support for it was based upon the use of the queens english <e> <s> i do not believe that one can include in the definition of a horse an ass or a mule any more than one includes in the definition of a motor car a bus lorry or motor cycle <e> <s> with that proviso i am inclined to accept the argument of the noble baroness lady nicol on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down has he ever heard of a case of anybody ever riding a foal <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down perhaps i may ask him this question <e> <s> is he suggesting seriously that the mother of the noble lord lord stoddart would have put him on the back of a foal on the public highway <e>

dangerous to put anything heavy on its back <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene <e> <s> in answer to my noble friend last night i telephoned a friend who has enormous experience in the riding world and herself trains horses <e> <s> she said that under no circumstances can a foal be older than six months <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord elton has introduced the bill with his usual clarity and fluency <e> <s> i do not imagine that he expects me to welcome it with open arms if so his assumptions are correct even though i freely acknowledge that the bill does not create a new offence

labour benches objected to the inclusion of these words in the motor vehicles wearing of rear seat belts by children act where precisely the same considerations as she has just advanced apply <e>",

lord lord addington suggested that anybody would put a saddle and bridle on a foal and take it onto a public road that is what we are talking about <e> <s> we are not speaking about perching a child on a foal of under five months in a field in order to take a photograph even assuming that that could be done holding the foal by a halter <e> <s> we are talking about taking an animal onto a public highway <e> <s> i think it is extremely improbable <e>", "<cs> my lords that is perfectly true <e> <s> i should indeed like to narrow it certainly so far as concerns exempting people who act in good faith <e> <s> with regard to the range of animals i rather feel that we lost that battle last time round <e> <s> i wish that that were not the case and that the rest of the committee had seen the force and merit of our arguments but it did not seem to do so <e> <s> at this stage or at third reading it would be a waste of time to pursue that point <e>", "<cs> the noble lord said confidently

birth certificate <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend said that we were going over the same ground again <e> <s> that is not correct because the amendment is more finely targeted it is a compromise and it has many precedents <e> <s> it avoids the defects of the amendments on the same basic subject that i moved at earlier stages <e> <s> i am to some extent heartened by the legal advice that my noble friend has obtained from the department on the precise meaning of the word permit but the word is ambiguous <e> <s> one can permit both actively and passively <e> <s> i am not per cent <e> <s>

article in to days <e>", "<cs> the committee may wonder why someone who is known to look askance at restrictive legislation and the excessive use of rules and regulations nevertheless has added his

enormous pleasure to a large number of people in london and south-east england <e> <s> they are mainly respectable middle-aged people who tend to have listened to the station since it opened in the mid s <e>", "<cs> i wish to reply if i may <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble viscount lord caldecote for his powerful support and to the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> i am particularly grateful to the noble lord lord annan for his powerful and detailed support <e> <s> he made only one error but it was a significant one <e> <s> radio caroline is not illegal because it is operated from a foreign vessel with a foreign crew in international waters <e> <s> her majestys government have at present no jurisdiction over it <e> <s> it would take more time than we are allowed to reply in detail to the noble earl lord ferrers but he mentioned that the penalties against drug smugglers are greater than the penalties that are likely to be imposed on radio disc jockeys <e> <s> i suppose that we must be thankful for small mercies <e> <s> we are talking about overkill and about a wholly disproportionate reaction to a minor irritance rather like sentencing someone to years imprisonment for parking on a double yellow line <e>", "<cs> i understood that we were running out of time <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that it will have to be a more lengthy debate because these matters cannot be rushed <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to the noble lord lord mcnair the noble baroness lady birk the noble lords lord mcintosh and lord orr-ewing and above all to my noble and learned friend lord wilberforce for their splendid support <e> <s> my noble and learned friend with his massive experience warned us of the serious and worrying international consequences for this country if the amendment is not accepted <e> <s> the noble earl uncharacteristically was somewhat illogical <e> <s> if radio caroline causes interference why did the government recently allocate the wave band on which radio caroline hitherto broadcast to another company thereby incidentally putting radio caroline off the air for the time being <e> <s> that does not seem like the action of a government who are genuinely worried about interference <e>", "<cs> that is a very honest answer <e> <s> it reinforces my feeling that we must test the opinion of the committee <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for his reply <e> <s> obviously time is short and he has had no time to reply at any great length <e> <s> i am afraid that he was under a misapprehension when he replied to amendment no <e> <s> bc which says nothing about preventing the enforcement officers from searching a ship <e> <s> that would have been so if that amendment had referred to line of the text <e> <s> however it refers to line which relates to searching people <e> <s> that is why the amendment is important <e> <s> i do not object to a ship being searched but i object to people being searched <e> <s> i do not think that that is necessary <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for his reply <e> <s> i note with interest that he says that there is a precedent for including a paragraph of this nature <e> <s> the seven-page legal opinion that i have in front of me takes a rather different view <e> <s> it states that it represents a very wide immunity and is particularly objectionable when it is remembered that it is proposed to be exercised extra-territorially <e>", "<cs> my lords in speaking to earlier amendments the noble baroness lady birk and the noble lord lord barnett drew our attention to the fact that relatively few members of the general public complain about bias in tv programmes <e> <s> that may be so but i felt that they drew the wrong conclusions from that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am fortunate enough to live for most of the year in a local authority area which a few years ago took strong measures against dog fouling <e> <s> the improvement in the quality of life since has been startling <e> <s> one would like to see the great benefits of the elimination of that nuisance extended to all urban areas <e> <s> for that reason i warmly welcome that amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i see that the amendment has been grouped with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> however the noble lord lord stanley of alderley did not speak to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely pleased to hear that as they deal with totally separate topics <e> <s> it is much better to deal with them separately <e> <s> i strongly support amendment no <e> <s> not only from the environmental point of view but also from the road safety point of view <e> <s> as the noble lord lord stanley has pointed out acceptance of the amendment would eliminate the great nuisance of advertising material being shoved under the windscreen wipers of cars <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the minister can clarify a further point before she sits down <e> <s> she said that placing advertising material under car windscreens would constitute littering <e> <s> is the material considered to be litter when it is under the windscreen wiper or only when it falls on to the ground after having been so placed <e>", "<cs> my lords this is another extremely worthwhile amendment <e> <s> the arguments advanced against a similar amendment although it had not been perfected as this one has at the previous stage were wholly unconvincing <e> <s> the argument was that it was tough on the poor manufacturers to be obliged to eliminate their dangerous ring-pulls <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not entirely satisfied <e> <s> the noble earl implies that no searches will be carried out on the high seas <e> <s> if that is the case it helps matters <e> <s> however there is nothing in the bill as drafted to provide that searches shall be carried out only within the united kingdom or its territorial waters <e> <s> that is the sole reason for my amendment <e> <s> i would not have brought the issue up if i had thought that the bill provided that all searches should be carried out within the uk <e> <s> that does not appear to be the case <e> <s> can the noble earl give me some reassurance on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not a legal expert as the noble earl is well aware <e> <s> the position seems strange and i shall have to have someone consider it with an eagle eye <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment but reserve the right possibly to bring it back at another stage <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that the main reason why we should not adopt european central time is that the united kingdom like greece portugal and the republic of ireland is not geographically situated in central europe <e>", "<cs> my lords we are up against the same dilemma as the house faced when debating amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the governments legal advisers say one thing and the legal advisers of what might loosely be termed the opposition say something else <e> <s> it is a question of taking ones pick of legal advice <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has not satisfied me <e> <s> as i set out at length on the previous occasion various ministerial statements both in this house and in another place have made it quite clear that as the law then stood despite the international radio regulations to which the noble earl referred there was no power to board foreign ships on the high seas without the consent of the foreign power concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for what he said <e> <s> however as i said when speaking to the previous amendment if he were to guarantee his presence at the home office for many years to come there would be no problem because he has given an assurance at the dispatch box and that is good enough for me <e> <s> the trouble is of course that he is referring to executive action and not statute law which is a different matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord the leader of the house for repeating such an admirable statement which i had the great pleasure to hear live on my car radio on my way to your lordships house and how splendidly delivered it was <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to congratulate my two noble friends on their quite outstanding maiden speeches <e> <s> although he is not in his place i should also like to congratulate the noble lord lord fitt on a superb speech on northern ireland <e> <s> i shall return to that shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but he claimed that the rpi increased by per cent <e> <s> between and <e> <s> if he checks the figures i believe he will find that he is incorrect because as far as i am aware the rpi has increased by per cent <e> <s> since <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for his reply although i venture to suggest that all monopolies even when privatised must to a considerable extent remain the responsibility of government <e> <s> does he agree first that while it is reasonable to charge for directory inquiry calls people who are too lazy to look up the correct number themselves it is unreasonable to do so if they have not first been supplied with an up-to-date telephone directory in which to look up the correct number <e> <s> secondly does he agree that the new scheme discriminates against the elderly and those with knee injuries for example who unlike younger or fitter people cannot walk several hundred yards to a public telephone box to obtain directory inquiries free of charge <e>", "<cs> my lords although her majestys government must be wary of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries far too common a vice nowadays does the minister nevertheless agree that where there is a mixture of tribes races languages and culture a loose federal structure with maximum local self-determination is greatly preferable to a tightly knit unitary structure <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for her reply disappointing though it is <e> <s> i half expected that some fresh thinking might have been applied to the subject <e> <s> however does she agree that it would make far more sense to cap business rates thereby helping businesses specifically especially small businesses than for example to lower interest rates prematurely which would only set off the appalling house price spiral once again to the great detriment of first-time buyers and to the economy generally <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that current valuations of business premises are based on the semi-boom conditions that prevailed in the spring of when interest rates were exceptionally low and business confidence was high <e> <s> are not those valuations unrealistically high in view of the slump that prevails today <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to follow the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon <e> <s> no doubt i shall pick up one or two of his themes <e> <s> i join other noble lords in congratulating the members of the select committee on the hours of hard work which they obviously must have put in <e> <s> the report is well written and well produced <e> <s> its conclusions are perhaps another matter <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed it is not responsible and that is the whole problem <e> <s> the european parliament can vote for spending but does not have the responsibility for raising the money <e> <s> it has the power to vote for spending in an irresponsible fashion <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should have referred to indirect spending in other words the european parliament can vote for policies which will cause member states of the ec to incur expenditure which in the absence of resolutions or directives emanating directly or indirectly from the european parliament they would not have otherwise incurred <e> <s> the taxpayers of the country concerned would not have had to fork out for those expenditures <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that to limit tax relief on mortgage interest to the standard rate something which should have happened a long time ago would make available almost billion for additional poll tax rebates to those whose earnings are below the national average <e>", "<cs> my lords while obviously the restoration of diplomatic relations with syria is to be welcomed in principle can the noble earl confirm that her majestys government are totally satisfied that the syrian authorities bear no responsibility whatever either direct or indirect for the lockerbie disaster <e>"]
