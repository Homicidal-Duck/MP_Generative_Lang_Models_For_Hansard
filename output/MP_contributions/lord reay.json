["<cs> my lords at this late hour after a succession of the most well-informed speeches i shall confine the few remarks that i wish to make to some aspects of the communitys infant energy policy and to the part which britain could perhaps play in it <e> <s> from many different points of view i am sure that there needs to be some form of community energy policy <e>", "<cs> my lords has my noble friend seen the terms of an attack reportedly made today on the secretary of state for northern ireland by the member for macclesfield mr nicholas winterton <e> <s> if so would my noble friend care to take this opportunity to repudiate the attack in regard to both its substance and its insulting terms <e>", "<cs> my lords while everyone would wish the english and welsh wine growers well and considering the climate would regard their achievements as remarkable may i ask my noble friend to give an assurance that no measures will be taken by her majestys government which would damage the vital interests of the long-established british wine industry <e>", "<cs> my lords like probably everybody else in the chamber with the exception of the noble lord lord shinwell i welcome the debate and congratulate my noble friend lord chelwood on introducing it <e> <s> incidentally i think that it was an uncalled-for misrepresentation on the part of the noble lord lord shinwell to imply any desire on the part of my noble friend lord chelwood to see or to seek the destruction of israel on the contrary i think that his desire to see the survival of israel was plain from his speech and i am sure that if tomorrow the noble lord lord shinwell re-reads the speech of my noble friend and respects the integrity of my noble friend he will come to a different conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords as a delegate to the assembly of the weu and present at the meeting of that assembly in rome on th october following the joint meeting of the foreign and defence ministers of the seven member states of weu incidentally the first occasion when there has been such a joint meeting and incidentally also unfortunately on the same day on which the noble lord lord gladwyn introduced this subject for debate in this house i should like to say something about current intentions to use weu to a greater extent as a means of increasing european defence co-operation <e>", "<cs> my lords as we approach the closing stages of this passionate and closely-fought debate with many able speeches having been delivered on both sides it is becoming difficult to develop new arguments <e> <s> i start from the standpoint that i believe it to be wrong and illogical to keep the principal medium of the age which is television out of the heart and centre of our democratic life which is parliament <e> <s> i believe it is all the less sensible at a time when we see increasing attempts to stage decisive political events outside rather than inside parliament <e> <s> parliament is under assault from without and from within and i submit that the public needs to be fully enrolled to assist in the process of restoring parliaments traditional authority <e>", "<cs> my lords the freedom and prosperity of every man woman and child in this country and in every other western european country depends on the strength of the western alliance <e> <s> in turn the strength of this alliance depends on a cohesion between its members particularly on the cohesion between the united states and europe <e>", "<cs> my lords several of the assumptions in the question of the noble lord lord gladwyn are themselves very questionable <e> <s> first it is doubtful whether it can be claimed and it certainly cannot be asserted that the soviet union has ever accepted the doctrine of mutual assured destruction <e> <s> if it had done it would surely have refrained from taking the defensive measures which it has in fact taken <e> <s> unlike the americans or any other nato country the soviet union has invested extremely heavily in civil defence also in anti-aircraft and anti-missile defence in deployment as well as in research <e> <s> it is generally believed that the soviet union spends as much as one half of its military budget on defensive as opposed to offensive weapons systems <e> <s> mr robert mcfarlane the presidents national security adviser and lord carrington natos secretary-general are both on record as saying they consider that the soviet union has violated the abm treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords we are straying a little from the point of this particular amendment moved by my noble friend lady elles which i should like to support although i preface my support by adding my congratulations to those already expressed to my noble friend lord glenarthur on his new appointment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all those who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> i have been very gratified by the general recognition that this subject has not been debated sufficiently and that to debate it on this occasion was timely <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> would he agree that in recent months the movements of the pound against the dollar have been greater than the movements of continental currencies against the dollar <e> <s> also would he agree that this is probably at least in part due to the fact that currencies within the ems are less attractive to speculators than currencies outside the ems and that therefore if this country were to join fully the ems this should give some stability for the currency and be of help to british manufacturers as well as those responsible for making government forecasts <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by congratulating the government on the excellent presentation of their statement on the defence estimates <e> <s> it seems to be well laid out lucidly argued and illustrated and admirably open and fair in its presentation of the military facts or what is known of the facts <e> <s> the white paper notably in annex a displays the relentless build-up of soviet russias conventional and theatre nuclear forces in europe and the astonishing growth of her submarine and surface fleet and indeed as the noble lord lord kennet was so right to point out of her merchant shipping fleet as well <e> <s> it shows the bewildering succession of new types of intercontinental missiles which she has introduced and which have succeeded in making vulnerable the united states land-based nuclear retaliatory capacity <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend the minister say what contributions have been made by eastern-bloc countries toward the relief of famine in ethiopia <e> <s> would she like to compare this with the contribution made by the united states of america <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the motion of my noble friend lord soames wholeheartedly <e> <s> i have met no one outside this house who does not consider the televising of our proceedings to have been a success <e> <s> it has brought an enormous increase in public interest and esteem to the proceedings of this house <e> <s> it has even added to the prestige of parliament as a whole redressing the balance given by the badly-received sound broadcasting of question time in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether her majestys government are going to be involved in any way in the distribution of the money raised by the live aid concert <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by joining with other peers in congratulating the sub-committee on european union under the chairmanship of the noble lord lord kearton for having introduced an admirably sensible and succinct report <e> <s> they received outstanding evidence <e> <s> i was not a member of that sub-committee but i had the good fortune to be present on one occasion to hear a brilliant contribution from mr christopher tugendhat who had recently retired as commissioner and was therefore able to combine experience with for the first time independence <e>", "<cs> apart from the perceived need to improve the decision-making machinery of the community the other strand in this bill and throughout the negotiations which led up to the agreement on the single european act was the desire to give more power or influence to the european parliament <e> <s> this desire was felt very much more strongly by some of our partners in the community than by ourselves indeed it was felt very much more strongly by some of them than is finally reflected in this bill <e> <s> but because of that although not only because of that something had to be done in this area to give more influence to the european parliament because as i say of these very strong wishes of some of our partners in the community and also for reasons of natural and historic logic <e>", "<cs> my lords some of us believe that two full days in committee discussing amendments none of which could be accepted or passed without wrecking this bill was a very considerable waste of the time of this house an abuse of the habit of indulgence of this house if not of its procedures and something which we would hope not to see again in a long time <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall pass on to what the effect of an amendment would be <e> <s> the fact is that an amendment to this bill would have amounted to the wrecking of the bill because an amendment would have been exactly the equivalent of a refusal by parliament to ratify the bill <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord bruce that parliament had to have a discussion on the bill and indeed it had a discussion on the question of ratification <e> <s> the question about which members of this house had to make up their minds was whether it was worth refusing to ratify the bill which would have been the consequence of accepting any one of the noble lords amendments and what would be the consequences of such a refusal <e>", "<cs> my lords it surely serves the cause of humanity if those who travel long distances to visit this country do so in the knowledge that when they arrive they will be admitted <e> <s> apart from the money which is squandered on air fares by the rising numbers of those who are refused entry and we have heard how the numbers have risen from in to in over half of those people coming from the five countries now under discussion there is the anxiety felt by many tens or even hundreds of thousands more who never know until the very last moment whether they will be admitted <e> <s> that situation has been remedied by the introduction of a system whereby visas will be issued before departure <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way for a moment since he quoted what i said on this matter <e> <s> i did not say that the french system would have been preferable <e> <s> i said that it was an alternative which the government could choose but that they were perfectly entitled to make the choice they did <e> <s> it would be quite wrong to describe the governments choice as racist <e>", "<cs> my lords the strategic outlook at the present time to adapt a phrase presents the picture of a mystery within an enigma <e> <s> the mystery is what will united states policy be over the next few years <e> <s> will president reagan push for a major arms control agreement in his last period in office <e> <s> will his sudden political weakness allow him to do so <e> <s> if there was such an agreement would it be a good or a bad one from europes point of view <e> <s> if there is no agreement what will be the policy of president reagans successor <e> <s> will a new administration take up one or other of the radical proposals that flew like ping-pong balls over the table at reykjavik or will reykjavik prove to be an aberration best forgotten a propaganda exercise staged and some would say won by chairman gorbachev <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will wait a moment <e> <s> in just the same way the soviet union used to propose the disbandment of the warsaw pact and nato forces knowing that the soviet union would find it a great deal easier than would the united states to replace those forces once they had been withdrawn even if the united states had the will to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that essentially alters the nature of the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that i was not aware that it was the proposal of the soviet union that those forces should be entirely destroyed <e> <s> i thought there was an element of removal involved <e> <s> obviously if they were to be destroyed that could be verified and one could be certain that they would not be replaced <e> <s> then my argument would not apply <e> <s> but it seems to me most unlikely that that situation will ever come into effect <e>", "<cs> my lords we must all be grateful to my noble friend lord home of the hirsel for having introduced this subject for debate at such an extremely opportune moment <e> <s> i have one faint criticism of the wording of the motion which is that a way was not found possible to include a reference in it to our western european allies <e> <s> it does not seem to me realistic today to consider relations between this country and the soviet union and this country and the united states in isolation from the rest of europe <e>", "<cs> my lords i start by congratulating my noble friend lord trefgarne on his reappointment and in particular by giving the warmest of welcomes to my noble friend lord glenarthur on his promotion to his senior position in the foreign and commonwealth office and to wish him the very best of luck in that post <e>", "<cs> my lords the eminent persons report that we are debating has met with universal praise this afternoon although i think probably few of its recommendations have been unanimously welcomed <e> <s> the most difficult matter seems likely to be the treatment of repeated statements and i should not like to guess now as to which view is likely to prevail in the end or if indeed a third one along the lines proposed by the noble lord lord henderson of brompton might be feasible <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not share the prevailing mood of joy and euphoria <e> <s> i do not wish to rehearse again today doubts which i have previously voiced about some of the implications of the inf treaty save only to say that there is a contradiction between the official european welcome for the treaty and the anxiety felt and expressed in the same quarters about what are in effect two of its main consequences namely the removal of certain links in the chain which binds the united states to europe and a step in the direction of europes de-nuclearisation <e> <s> the destruction of a whole category of nuclear weapons will be a hollow source of satisfaction if it amounts to a step which leads in the wrong direction <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the time has come when the government should consider whether it is still appropriate to continue to squeeze relentlessly the british councils direct aid budget <e> <s> undoubtedly the british council has managed to develop very successfully in recent years its self-financing activities principally english language teaching the importance of which the noble lord <e> <s> lord bonham-carter correctly emphasised <e> <s> also it has developed the involvement of private sponsors to such an extent that the council can claim to have had a hand in tours and exhibitions at a cost of only million <e> <s> nevertheless such services as the welfare of overseas students in this country and the provision of a layer albeit a thin layer of british cultural facilities and <e>", "<cs> i hope also that the government will consider seriously the point which my noble friend lady young has made <e> <s> i can see that the government may not wish this new subject to be brought into the bill at this time <e> <s> however my noble friend has put her finger on a wrongfully neglected field and i hope that they will reflect on the matter and come up with proposals to remedy the defect <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the government on having arrived at a position where they are able to start the process of privatisation of electricity the largest act of privatisation ever undertaken so far as i am aware <e> <s> it could be said to mark the apogee to date at least in the retreat from that now discredited ideology <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with great interest to the speech of the noble lord the leader of the opposition this afternoon <e> <s> i thought he gave a charming and persuasive picture of what happened in the pre-war period <e> <s> but that is a different period of history <e> <s> i do not contest his claim that at that time the public ownership of electricity may have been necessary but times have changed and today we live in a different period <e>", "<cs> my lords the middle east is everyones concern <e> <s> it is the crucible of hatred in the world <e> <s> the hatreds fomented not least in the territories occupied by israel spill out in terrorism directed principally against european countries <e> <s> the danger of war is ever present and each war has the capacity to be more calamitous than the last as missiles acquire longer ranges wider distribution and more ominous warheads <e> <s> no one can say what countries may be sucked into and perhaps destroyed by another war <e> <s> so europes vital interest in the arab-israeli conflict is established even without reference to factors of commerce and national resources <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate my noble friend lord strathclyde on his appointment and to wish him well as he takes the crease for what i assume must be his first innings for the government side <e>", "<cs> my lords despite what the noble lord lord winstanley had to say about himself and his brother and their evidently remarkable prescience in this matter the committee records a date no earlier than for the discovery by scientists of the battle that was raging in the stratosphere between chlorine and ozone and the terrible danger of defeat that our good friend and protector ozone was in as a result of the reinforcements that we were sending to his mortal enemy chlorine <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by taking this opportunity to express my appreciation for the fact that the government saw fit recently to increase the annual direct grant to the british council which several of us in this house were calling for last january on a motion of the noble lord lord bonham-carter <e> <s> the british council is widely thought to do an outstanding job in promoting british interests overseas and i am confident that this quite modest sum will prove to be money well spent <e>", "<cs> my lords scottish nationalism at its most dangerous is i believe composed of two elements a grievance and a temptation to dream <e> <s> in the s the grievance was the failure of the government to make the economy work properly not just the scottish economy but the british economy as a whole <e> <s> the temptation was north sea oil which gave spurious credibility to the notion of an economically viable independence <e>", "<cs> my lords we are much indebted to the select committee on the european communities and <e>", "<cs> my lords as other noble lords have pointed out this has been a difficult debate to prepare for since at least some of us were unaware of what charges the noble lord lord jenkins of hillhead intended to bring against the government <e>", "<cs> my lords history has carried us into a new era as regards the approach needed to enable us to continue to live in a clean and healthy environment <e> <s> in the s at the time of the clean air act it was found to be sufficient to ban forms of combustion from city centres where its heavy concentration was producing obnoxious results <e> <s> where the factories then went was not thought to matter <e> <s> similarly factory emisions had to be released through tall chimneys so that they were dispersed widely indeed anywhere so long as they were not deposited locally <e> <s> sewage had to be carried far enough out to sea to avoid polluting the coast <e> <s> incidentally that practice has not yet been stopped <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we can be immensely grateful to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter for reopening today the parliamentary debate on sunday trading and for giving us the first opportunity to see whether there have been any shifts of opinion since the shops bill was thrown out in another place in april <e> <s> as the debate recommences i wish to say to the government that i hope that they will not prematurely close any of their options <e> <s> in particular i hope that they will not totally exclude the possibility of complete deregulation for all of sunday unless and until they decide they finally have to <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i was talking at this moment about the opposition <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not my current recollection <e> <s> if they were not applied it is rather remarkable that the vote <e>", "<cs> my lords the vote in another place was a remarkably strong vote against the shops bill <e> <s> it is particularly remarkable that the vote of the scottish members of parliament who after all were voting to deny to england what they freely enjoyed in scotland should have been unanimously against the governments proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> that will be a matter for the government and the house of commons <e> <s> we in this house cannot assist the government in making a judgment as to what kind of a compromise they will have to produce this time <e> <s> that is a judgment which the government will have to make on an assessment of what is likely to happen in another place <e> <s> here we can only make plain our individual preferences <e> <s> i hope that the government will bear firmly in mind that the indications are that the majority of the public want greater freedom to trade on sunday <e> <s> i hope that they will not let the wishes of the majority for no good reason be frustrated by the dictate of a minority <e>", "<cs> under reporting may take place for many reasons <e> <s> the authors of the analysis of the home office british crime survey took the view that during the s when the statistics of recorded crime showed an increase in burglary of per cent <e> <s> there had been an increase of only per cent <e> <s> the discrepancy being accounted for by an enormous increase in the reporting of burglaries <e> <s> that was attributed to the rapid spread during that period of both the telephone and insurance of household goods the former making reporting easier and the latter encouraging the expectation of some measure of redress <e>", "<cs> my lords the right reverend prelate is down to speak later and he will have an opportunity to make the point <e> <s> if he gives me a hearing i assure him that i shall give him one when he makes the point that he wishes to make <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank everyone who has taken part in this debate <e> <s> nobody wishes to introduce a major debate without a respectable number of speakers and there has certainly been that <e> <s> the second need which anyone has in introducing a debate on a controversial subject or a subject with controversial aspects like penal policy is sufficient support from ones own side and i have been lucky enough to enjoy that in the greatest measure in contributions of the highest quality <e> <s> i am immensely grateful to my noble friends for the efforts they have made <e>", "<cs> my lords the first substantive words of the much referred to report of the marre committee on the future of the legal profession published in july last year under the title if i may remind noble lords of

the limit to for cases which can be heard there <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow other noble lords in thanking my noble friend lord home of the hirsel for bringing this subject to the house for debate today and for the balanced and immensely authoritative speech with which he introduced it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow other noble lords in thanking the noble lord

committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> this is just to leave no doubt at all that the time must be the time when the application is made <e>", "<cs> i think it might be a convenient moment for the committee to adjourn <e> <s> i suggest that the committee stage begins again at pm <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> has the effect of deleting subsection of clause which amplifies the type of bill or receipt which an applicant must submit before grant can be paid <e> <s> in particular it deletes the restriction on the provision of bills or receipts made out by the applicant or a family member <e>", "<cs> at the end of his speech the noble lord asked two questions one of which i am not able to answer now <e> <s> i shall let him have the answer when i have it myself <e> <s> his second question was whether the bill added to the types of building which would be entitled to exemption <e> <s> the answer is no <e>", "<cs> i am very happy that my noble friend put down this amendment and

considerable sympathy with the dilemma which they describe <e> <s> undoubtedly organisations like the aa and the rac provide a valuable service in supplying and erecting temporary traffic signs <e>

about but which does not exist at the moment <e> <s> i do not think there is advantage for me in spelling out further what might be meant by widespread and prevalent <e> <s> they are ordinary words

perhaps i should add that the lord president of the council has been holding discussions with the select committees on procedure and on european legislation in another place to examine whether procedures may be improved <e> <s> the select committee on procedure is expected to report soon and the government will give careful consideration to its conclusions <e>", "<cs> my lords there are requirements in the building regulations relating to the insulation of new buildings and the provision of controls for space heating and hot water supply systems <e> <s> the secretary of state for the

matter is to bring to an end the practice of allowing arrears to accumulate unchecked <e> <s> we believe that we have introduced a disincentive to prevent a practice continuing which only local authorities have the capacity to control <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only repeat that the discipline of the ring fence round the housing revenue account to which the noble lord referred will ensure

made a point which was taken up by the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon about the defect in the original orders <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no provision in the headquarters agreement which will exempt those people from the community charge <e>", "<cs> my lords since october the overseas development administration has been managing a forestry initiative to promote the wise and sustainable use of forest resources <e> <s> in november last year my right honourable friend the prime minister announced that we would aim to commit a further million bilaterally to tropical forestry activities over the next three years <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree that the destruction of the tropical rain forests would be a tragedy <e> <s> we believe that the best way of preventing it is for the aid-donor countries and international agencies to act in co-operation with the governments and people of the countries in which the forests are to be found and to take initiatives to save those forests <e> <s> that is our policy <e>", "<cs> my lords the development of forestry in this country has an important role to play in supplying timber requirements <e> <s> as regards the suggestion

co-operation of the governments and the people of the developing countries <e> <s> the overseas development administration is now involved in the running or preparation of projects in different countries <e> <s> therefore there is a wide measure of co-operation <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that the main cause of deforestation arises from the poverty of the people living around the forests <e> <s> in many countries the population is growing rapidly <e> <s> people need land for agriculture and wood for fuel for cooking and heating <e> <s> we must address ourselves to those problems <e>",

agree with my noble friend that it is extremely important to take to heart the interests of the people who live in the forests <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount has made a good point <e> <s> the forests are an important asset for the developing countries and we must encourage them to develop them on a sustainable basis <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said we do not believe that we should pursue the path of restricting imports of tropical timber rather we should seek better management of the forests so that that can be done on a sustainable basis <e>", "<cs> my lords the tropical forestry action plan was drawn up in by the united nations food and agriculture organisation the world bank the united nations development programme and a north american ngo the world resources institute <e> <s> it provides the main mechanism by which donors can have a dialogue with developing countries about their forestry policies <e> <s> accordingly our own forestry programme in each country is where possible

eliminate their use in particular areas of application namely by july in the case of flexible foam and aerosols and by january when used as a solvent <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start where the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey ended by congratulating my noble friend lord cranbrook on bringing forward this measure for your lordships consideration <e> <s> in doing so he has succeeded

public sector campaign run by the energy efficiency office which aims to save million a year in government departments <e>", "<cs> my lords i have often been very favourably impressed by the fact that after hours there are not very many lights burning at this end of the palace of westminster <e> <s> certainly much care is taken to try to ensure that electricity is not wasted in that respect <e>",

same direction <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the noble lords first point <e> <s> i have been doing my best to comply with it <e> <s> with respect to the lights required by television that

security staff are also asked to switch off lights in empty offices <e> <s> i shall draw the complaint of the noble lord to their attention <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord is quite right <e>", "<cs> my lords some years ago the government ran a massive advertising campaign which was supported by many different events in different parts of the country <e> <s> the campaign was very

security staff are satisfied that the security requirements of the site in question have been adequately met by other means including the employment of contract guards <e> <s> the ministry of defence reviews and monitors the performance of all contract security guards extremely carefully <e> <s> where requirements are not met action will be taken including the termination of the contract where necessary <e> <s> such action has recently been taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the details for which the noble lord asked <e> <s> however as regards his second question it is ministry of defence policy as far as possible to employ ministry of defence police officers only where there is a need for their constabulary powers specialised training and/or a requirement to be armed <e> <s> they are a skilled and specialised force and we cannot afford to employ such scarce resources on tasks for which their expertise is not required <e>", "<cs> no my lords i can give no such assurance <e> <s> i repeat that contract guards will be used only under tight control and the arrangements will be subject to regular review <e>", "<cs> my lords on the noble lords last point i completely agree that it is necessary to devote additional resources to protect the lives of our servicemen and their dependants from the terrorist threat <e> <s> an additional million has been allocated over the next three years to improve security at defence establishments in this country and overseas <e>", "<cs> my lords as i think i made plain in the previous answer it is the practice to use ministry of defence police where the requirements of their specialised training and constabulary powers are required <e> <s> if there is a requirement to be armed only those police are employed <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly the case that contract guards may not be armed <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said the ministry of defence reviews and monitors carefully the performance of all contract security guards and will only employ them where it is satisfied that it is proper to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only repeat that the decision to do that is taken by the ministry of defence security staffs only when they are satisfied that thereby security requirements can be properly met <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that that is so <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not correct to imply that the government are cutting costs on this matter <e> <s> as i said we are devoting an additional million over the next three years to improving security at defence establishments in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords we

serious floods that have severely affected more than half of tunisian territory <e> <s> twenty-five deaths have been reported <e> <s> approximately people have been affected <e>", "<cs> my lords i note and welcome what the noble lord says <e>", "<cs> my lords both the united kingdom and hong kong are fully committed to the conservaton of the african elephant <e> <s> hong kong will comply with the ban on international commercial trade in ivory after a breathing space of six months <e> <s> since june hong kong has banned imports of ivory into the territory thereby ensuring that there is no incentive for poaching <e>", "<cs> my lords vigorous controls are in force in hong kong to try to prevent the situation feared by my noble friend <e> <s> apart from the import ban enforced in june last year other measures have been taken <e> <s> every trader in hong kong must register all stocks above kilogrammes and he must possess a licence for holding them <e> <s> he will receive an export licence only if the ivory comes from those registered stocks and is accompanied by valid cites documentation <e> <s> moreover the destination of the ivory must not be a cites party which exercises a ban on ivory imports <e> <s> we believe that the controls should ensure that there is no loophole for entry on to the market of illegal ivory <e>", "<cs> my lords in the fight against poaching we have provided assistance <e> <s> for example to kenya in the form of trucks and ammunition <e> <s> we are prepared to look carefully at any other requests which we may receive for such assistance <e> <s> i shall look into the proposal made by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords we entered the reservation which runs out in five months time in order to allow traders time to dispose of their legally acquired stocks in an orderly fashion and also to enable some ivory carvers and workers in hong kong to find alternative employment <e> <s> we considered that to enter a reservation was the best way of meeting our responsibilities to a dependent territory without compromising our strong support for measures which are intended to secure the future of the african elephant <e>", "<cs> my lords at

promised to do more <e> <s> i can only repeat what i said in my original reply namely that we believe that it is extremely important to send a signal to the white community that the steps taken by president de klerk will find a reply from the international community <e> <s> that is the basis of our position <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with my noble and learned friend <e>", "<cs> my

time on a voluntary basis to providing extra curriculum opportunities for pupils to participate in sport <e> <s> the government fully recognise the valuable contribution they make <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it would be useful if i were to set out the governments position before the bill leaves this house <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in our view the danger would be that if they were to be prohibited by the year their manufacture would not be undertaken <e> <s> as i said at report stage this was simply making the best the enemy of the good <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not say that <e> <s> we believe that it is important to try to reduce the quantity of cfcs admitted to the atmosphere and the way in which i set forth that it should be done is in our view the best way to approach the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure we are all grateful to the noble lord lord st john of bletso for giving us the opportunity to debate the subject of south africa this evening <e> <s> it is a country in which there <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very concerned about the danger of a nuclear arms race developing in the sub-continent <e> <s> pakistan has however always asserted that it does not possess or intend to develop nuclear weapons <e> <s> we take every suitable opportunity in our contacts with the government of pakistan to stress our continuing concern <e> <s> as a depositary power the uk is strongly in favour of universal adherence to the non-proliferation treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords the non-proliferation treaty came into force in since when states have become parties <e> <s> the fourth review conference will be held in geneva from th august to th september and will be of particular importance as it is the last conference before the treaty comes up for extension <e> <s> as a depositary power the united kingdom is working actively for a successful outcome to the conference <e>", "<cs> my lords we have in the past urged pakistan to accede to the non-proliferation treaty and the pakistanis have made it clear that they will accede when india does so <e> <s> we take every opportunity to encourage the indians to reconsider their position and we continue to encourage pakistan to set an example by acceding first <e>", "<cs> my lords this matter was last raised by my noble friend lord brabazon with both the pakistani and the indian authorities during his visit to the sub-continent in february <e>", "<cs> my lords in raising the question of iraq the noble lord goes wider than the question on the order paper though i can understand why he should wish to do so <e> <s> iraq is a party to the non-proliferation treaty as he said and as such has undertaken not to develop a nuclear weapons capability <e> <s> we expect iraq to abide by its international legal commitments <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe it is generally recognised that the non-proliferation treaty has been successful in discouraging states from developing nuclear weapons and declaring themselves as nuclear weapon states <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would like to table a question on that aspect i shall be glad to answer it <e> <s> i do not think that i can add much more to what i have already said <e>", "<cs> no my lords we do not believe that the situations are comparable <e> <s> the position of the united kingdom with regard to disarmament remains that if the united states and soviet arsenals were substantially reduced we would consider how to contribute to the nuclear arms control process <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state is able to make balanced and well-informed planning decisions without making site visits in person <e> <s> planning decisions are based on evidence presented by the parties and the assessment of an inspector who will have visited the site <e> <s> an essential feature of the decision-making process is that each principal party will be fully aware of the representations made by other parties and have the opportunity to comment on those representations <e> <s> oral evidence proffered outside the context of public inquiry and written representation procedures is inadmissible <e>", "<cs> my lords i must repeat the point <e> <s> were the secretary of state to visit the sites of proposals currently before him for decision whether he was accompanied by his statutory advisers on the subject of heritage or not he could be lobbied by anybody present including the appellant or anyone else with an interest and his decision would be open to challenge on the ground of partiality <e>", "<cs> my lords i repeat that in our view it would not be proper for the secretary of state to visit sites for which proposals are currently before him for decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i was talking about i think i was asked about sites for which proposals were currently before the secretary of state for decision <e> <s> that is certainly the case concerning avebury <e> <s> as regards other sites my noble friend lord hesketh who has particular responsibility for heritage matters has in the course of his duties visited several world heritage sites and sometimes he has been accompanied by my noble friend lord montagu of beaulieu who is chairman of english heritage <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend will continue to make such visits in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord makes a perfectly valid point <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord graham of edmonton asked me about the register <e> <s> in that regard we intend to lay the necessary regulations before the summer recess after we have consulted the local authority associations <e> <s> we see the question of the register as being a separate issue from that of the code and we want to have further discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords we await an answer from the european commission to our request <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that until the commission has replied to our letter i am unable to say what action has been taken <e> <s> we have asked the commission when we can expect a reply to our letter and we hope to receive one shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the situation is that we should like to see both agreements implemented <e> <s> we shall do our best to try to achieve that if we possibly can <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to the second question of the noble lord the leader of the opposition it is my understanding that the gibraltar government do not wish to implement the airport agreement <e> <s> as regards the first question i do not think that i can say any more than that we await a reply to our letter from the commission <e> <s> at the moment we must leave it at that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not in a position to say anything regarding communications which may have taken place between the commission and the spanish government <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot add to what i have said <e> <s> we have approached the commission with a request that infraction proceedings be commenced under the treaty <e> <s> the ball is now in the commissions court and we await a reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i can inform my noble friend that our letter to the commission was dated th february <e> <s> we shall consider whether to bring a case before the european court of justice and whether to try to enlist the support of any other member states at the appropriate time <e> <s> we should not exclude the possibility of doing so if such action were likely to be helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding of the matter is that there are two agreements under the brussels process <e> <s> both date from <e> <s> one is the agreement on the airport the other on the ferry service <e> <s> these are not formally linked to each other <e> <s> however the gibraltar government will not implement the airport agreement and therefore spain will not implement the ferry agreement <e> <s> not implementing the ferry agreement falls foul in our view of the european community regulations hence our approach to the commission <e>", "<cs> my lords it might be helpful if i state briefly the governments view of the bill <e>", "<cs> we do not believe that the addition of the word business at various places in clauses and would add anything of significance to the bill <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> seeks to incorporate into the bill a requirement for consultation on employment terms and conditions <e> <s> in our view adequate provisions are already included in tupe which apply automatically to the transfers of psa and tcs without the need for a specific provision in the bill <e>", "<cs> i believe that i gave the arguments when i spoke earlier <e> <s> the main point is that the government will allow a reasonable length of time for the necessary consultations <e> <s> we have given an assurance that we hope that that will be within a period of one month <e> <s> if it is necessary to continue it beyond that we shall be willing to do that but we cannot agree to be tied down in advance to a particular timetable <e>", "<cs> there may well be circumstances in which it would be possible to complete all the agreemsnts within the -day period <e> <s> in such a situation it cannot be to the advantage of the company to delay privatisation any longer <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the purpose of this amendment is to prevent changes to the existing pattern of the psa and tcs offices <e> <s> in our view the amendment would place unacceptable restrictions upon the commercial management of the businesses <e> <s> this would be damaging to both the organisations and their staff <e> <s> the amendment might also rule out the separate privatisation of any division or region of the businesses if that was thought to be most appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords the nature conservancy council has identified potential special protection areas in england and wales of which have so far been designated <e> <s> consultations are continuing on the remainder in accordance with article of the ec directive <e> <s> the nature conservancy council has also identified potential ramsar sites in england and wales of which have been designated <e> <s> the government remain fully committed to international bird conservation and will continue to meet their obligations <e>", "<cs> my lords the figure that i gave was that the nature conservancy council has identified potential special protection areas in england and wales of which have so far been designated <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot explain the difference in the figures that we have at the moment <e> <s> nor i am afraid can i say anything about the case that the noble baroness raises <e> <s> however i shall be happy to write to her with information about it <e>", "<cs> my lords our principal concern must be to make sure that we carry out our obligations under the ec directive <e> <s> we believe that our record in bird conservation is extremely good compared with that of some other countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to join the noble lord in paying tribute to the extremely important work that the voluntary bodies do in the field of bird conservation <e> <s> i have no doubt that they will continue to enjoy government support <e> <s> i cannot give any promises about any future announcement with regard to ramsar sites <e> <s> as i said in a previous answer sites will be announced as soon as necessary consultations have been completed <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is right <e> <s> the question relates to england and wales <e> <s> however a question tomorrow on the same subject will relate to scotland <e> <s> my noble friend will have an opportunity to make his point again <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot say how many will be in the next batch to be announced or when that may happen <e> <s> the government are currently h <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is right and i am pleased that he made the point <e>", "<cs> my lords in order to ensure that protection is given even before designation of spas and ramsar sites is made circular / requires planning authorities to ensure that potential spas are treated as though they were already designated spas and to take account of their international significance when considering development proposals <e> <s> they must do so in order to continue a substantial measure of protection for the sites before designation <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> i entirely disagree with the noble lord <e> <s> we value the scientific advice provided by the nature conservancy council and we hope that it will be able to continue to provide that <e>", "<cs> my lords we have played a full part in that and also in reaching agreement on the ec directive <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to note the noble lords remarks and to pass them on <e> <s> i am also grateful for his comment about the nature conservancy council <e> <s> of course there are many other interests which must be taken into account and to which the government are bound to pay heed <e> <s> for that reason we must proceed carefully when designating the sites <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have any information about that but i shall be happy to look into the matter and advise my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the government attach great importance to green belts as an essential element of planning policy <e> <s> the extent of designated green belt in england has more than doubled since <e> <s> it has increased from million acres to million acres <e> <s> that represents nearly per cent <e> <s> of the total land area of england <e>", "<cs> my lords the essential characteristic of green belts is their permanence and their protection must be maintained for as far ahead as can be seen <e> <s> within green belts there is a general presumption against inappropriate development <e> <s> except in special circumstances the construction of new buildings should not be approved unless it is for agriculture and forestry outdoor sport cemeteries institutions standing in extensive grounds or other uses appropriate to a rural area <e>", "<cs> my lords i assume that the protection required under a green belt requires designation <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the governments view that the aim should be to use redundant buildings for purposes which are compatible with the green belt including institutional uses <e> <s> on the question of housing there may be scope for local planning authorities to accept limited low-cost housing development in existing green belt settlements <e>", "<cs> my lords my honourable friend the minister for the environment and countryside will launch the environment week at the telecom tower on thursday th april <e> <s> the government very much welcome this initiative by the civic trust to encourage people to help improve their local environment <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with what the noble lord said about the significance and value of environment week <e> <s> we also consider it to be a wholly admirable occasion <e> <s> it is an enterprise undertaken by the civic trust <e> <s> its intention is to focus attention on the local environment in order to encourage people to find out more about the area in which they live and to join in practical local projects <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of the facts about which the noble lord has informed the house <e> <s> there were earth day events in this country also <e> <s> so far as i know they did not lead to such unhappy consequences <e> <s> there was no direct government involvement <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an entirely different question <e> <s> it is a matter for the other place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of any other government involvement in environment week other than launching the week itself <e>", "<cs> my lords a great many voluntary bodies are doing a great deal to clear up the environment <e> <s> we welcome all such efforts <e> <s> a considerable number of bodies are involved in environment week <e> <s> i have a list that i shall not read out <e> <s> they are all organisations which receive substantial government support <e>", "<cs> my lords the intention of environment week is very much directed at local activities very largely on a small scale <e> <s> the leaflet that was distributed by british telecom advertising the week listed some of the achievements last year <e> <s> those included items such as hanging baskets and window boxes which gave a facelift to gateshead technical college <e> <s> an unsightly broken fence was pulled down and replaced in a single day by the polesworth society <e> <s> a three-mile stretch of beach was cleared by the llanelli society <e> <s> those are thoroughly admirable achievements but we feel they are best left to local groups under

kingdoms representation <e> <s> we are also acting to encourage more united kingdom candidates to apply for employment in the community institutions <e> <s> we and the commission will continue to work closely together to remedy the present situation <e>", "<cs> my lords the remuneration has not been rewarding enough to attract a sufficiency of united kingdom candidates which has been the main reason why the situation exists <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble lord the leader of the opposition is right in saying that traditionally languages have been an impediment to recruitment <e> <s> however one of the measures that the government are now introducing is the development of a european stream within administration grade recruitment to the civil service <e> <s> this will increase the number of good quality officials fitted for work in the european community institutions <e> <s> language training will be provided <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the noble lord that at

government intend to do the european commission also intends to introduce procedures which should assist with the problem <e> <s> one of those is to bring forward from the reserve list more united kingdom nationals awaiting jobs where those were successful in competitions <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the select committee of your lordships house which reported in made a point of this complaint <e> <s> however it has now become increasingly accepted that a spell in brussels benefits the united kingdom as well as the commission <e> <s> individual career prospects should therefore

first with the various related definitions of environment pollution harm and so forth contained in clause <e> <s> they are not easy concepts to define even in the abstract <e> <s> when however they are required as the basis of a sophisticated and what has to be a tightly drawn system of regulatory control the difficulties of getting them right are even greater <e>", "<cs> this amendment overlaps with the matter that we were dealing with in the previous amendment <e> <s> my noble friend lord lucas takes over a point which we were discussing namely the different definitions of pollution in two parts of the bill <e> <s> that matter was also taken up by the noble earl lord halsbury who raised the matter of concentrations <e> <s> as i understand it there is no reference to concentrations in

in part ii of the bill which deals with solid wastes on land <e> <s> clause makes it plain that the quantity and concentration of the waste concerned are relevant <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly restate our position as i see it <e> <s> there are two definitions of pollution one in part i and one in part ii <e> <s> they differ in several respects <e> <s> for example as i mentioned earlier in part ii there is a reference to release or escape whereas there is not in part i there is also reference to substance or articles whereas there is not in part i but the difference that we have concentrated on is that there is a reference to the quantity or concentrations involved whereas there is no such qualifying description applied to pollution in part i the reason for that is that we do not wish pollution to be qualified in this way because it would restrict pollution that we feel should come within the scope of the pollution controls in part i that is our position <e>", "<cs> these amendments seek to give local authorities integrated pollution control powers rather than just control over air pollution <e> <s> integrated pollution control is a new concept in international environmental control and represents a major development for both industry and regulators <e> <s> it will not be an easy task to determine the best practicable environmental option for processes with significant pollution potential even for the central inspectorates with their experience of sophisticated engineering control techniques or for those industries which are familiar with the current requirements of best practicable means <e> <s> it is therefore not something that could be easily and rapidly be taken on by local authorities or by the industries of which they are to take control

obligation would not add anything to the duties to which the enforcing authorities are already subject in setting the conditions of an authorisation <e>", "<cs> i agree with my noble friend that an application must contain an adequate assessment of the likely effects of the process on the environment <e> <s> my honourable friends in another place stated that it is our intention that such an assessment must be included in an application for an authorisation which will be required in regulations made under <e>", "<cs> these amendments allow us to consider what is perhaps the central clause of part i of the bill and its fundamental concepts namely best practicable environmental option and best available techniques not entailing excessive costs <e>", "<cs> i am not convinced that this amendment adds anything to the provisions of clause <e> <s> the fourth environmental action programme of the european community is obviously extremely important <e> <s> that is why the united kingdom

pollution control <e>", "<cs> i congratulate my noble friend on tabling amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it results from his careful scrutiny of the bill and he has identified an infelicitous reference which the government are happy to correct <e>", "<cs> the effect of the amendment would be to delete an amendment which the government brought forward on report in another place <e> <s> at committee stage in another place the point was fairly made that as many industrial processes involve a serious risk of pollution the drafting of clause without any reference to time or urgency was extremely wide and imprecise hence the introduction of the word imminent <e> <s> i think i can reassure the noble lord that the purpose of his amendment is already provided for by clause which allows the enforcing authority to serve an enforcement notice when it considers that the condition of an authorisation is likely to be breached and so by implication run the risk of causing pollution of the environment <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has succeeded in identifying another drafting error in the bill which once again the government are happy to correct <e>", "<cs> my noble friend seeks to put certain notices into abeyance pending appeal with special provision for prohibition notices in recognition of the serious and imminent danger of pollution that they are designed to prevent <e>", "<cs> in another place there was some debate about whether the draft of the bill brought forward by the government would allow a person to bring proceedings against the operator of a process without

place <e> <s> also it would increase rents <e> <s> both those effects would damage londons position as a pre-eminent financial centre and the government do not intend to give any encouragement to the

forces kept up to date where necessary would remain essential to natos strategy of preventing war but that soviet troop withdrawals and the implementation of a cfe agreement would also permit a reduced reliance on nuclear weapons especially systems of shortest range <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord is comparatively pleased with my reply <e> <s> in the london summit the declaration makes clear that nuclear weapons will continue to fulfil an essential role in the overall strategy of the alliance by ensuring that there are no circumstances in which nuclear retaliation

a slightly different form from on previous occasions both in your lordships house and in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords the government cannot accept this group of amendments <e> <s> we support the

no intention of intervening in the remit of the commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i was indeed entirely aware of the noble lords first two points <e> <s> the remit of the press complaints commission will be narrower than that of the press council but whether or not this narrower remit will make the commission more effective is a matter for speculation <e> <s> the important point is that the government will consider putting regulation on a statutory basis if the commission is not effective <e> <s> we are confident that the commission can be effective so long as it has the support of the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord raised a number of points <e> <s> the general assessment of the calcutt report was that the press council was ineffective <e> <s> we welcome the proposal that it should be replaced by the proposed press complaints commission <e> <s> the situation at present is that the industry is to be self-regulated for at any rate a further months <e> <s> at the end of that period we shall review the situation and decide whether it is necessary to introduce legislation to put the commission on a statutory basis <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all members of

the position in which we now find ourselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his closing remarks which i fully endorse <e>", "<cs> my lords it is plain that the situation which

ourselves <e> <s> the calcutt committee recommended the establishment of this new commission <e> <s> we give it our support but we must wait to see whether it is effective as a method of self-regulation <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the government will be looking only at the effectiveness of the press complaints commission they will also be looking at the effectiveness of self-regulation more widely practised in for example the areas to which the noble lord referred which are not within the remit of the commission <e> <s> the government will be looking at all those aspects of self-regulation over the next months <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that that is another question to which i have no answer at present <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps this is an appropriate moment to adjourn <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now adjourn until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness pointed out an amendment which would have had a similar effect was moved in committee although it was technically defective <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord hesketh said in committee in the governments view it would be inappropriate to confer an archaeological remit on the new councils which they would not have the capacity to fulfil <e> <s> however as several noble lords have said the ncc is currently working with english heritage and cadw to draw up a joint statement of intent to ensure that no feature of anthropogenic interest is damaged subject to the primacy of nature conservation interests <e> <s> the noble lord lord walpole said that he had

undertaking an activity that affects nature conservation the councils could advise it <e>", "<cs> my lords that was the suggestion originally made by my noble friend lord cranbrook <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason for doing that is because those words are redundant since section already applies to all sssis <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly note what my noble friend says and i shall look carefully at it <e>", "<cs> my lords schedule to the bill is directly related to the fundamental purpose of part vii which is to devolve the exercise of nature conservation functions to the respective countries of england scotland and wales <e> <s> the purpose of this section specifically is to ensure that those nature reserves and sites of special scientific interest which straddle the borders of england and scotland or england and wales are treated as two separate sites one in each country <e> <s> subparagraph goes on to specify how the two separate sites should be managed for example a cross-boundary site could be managed by the two councils concerned separately but with full consultation or by some joint management regime if they considered that to be preferable <e> <s> however the effect of the noble lords amendment would be to leave these sites unaltered that is as a single site <e> <s> this would create not only practical problems for example over the management of the site but legal ones as well <e> <s> which council would be legally responsible for the site for the enforcement of any regulations covering the site concerning nature reserve agreements or potentially damaging operations <e> <s> i am assured that the omission of this subparagraph would create a muddle and i trust therefore that the noble lord will not press the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased that the noble lord lord ross of newport shares the governments concern that there should be controls on diffuse pollution by nitrate and pesticides <e> <s> powers to control diffuse nitrate and pesticide pollution already exist in the water act and the food and environment protection act <e> <s> we are using these powers to address the concerns raised by the noble lord and believe that

my original answer we have repeatedly called on all parties in the conflict to stop fighting and co-operate to the full in working out details of such a settlement <e>", "<cs> my lords the five permanent members of the security council will continue their work to prepare for detailed discussion of a settlement based on the new york framework <e> <s> that includes pressure being brought on the cambodians to settle their differences over the appointment of a chairman to the supreme national council <e> <s> against that background we hope that the co-ordinating committee of the paris international conference on cambodia will reconvene soon to agree details of the settlement and we hope that that could lead to a plenary session of the paris international conference on cambodia

jakarta on th december is a matter for those parties to decide in accordance with the new york framework agreement <e> <s> that agreement specifies that it should be composed of representative

transport provided by european community regulation no <e> <s> / and that therefore there were no grounds for seeking an explanation from the spaniards <e> <s> we are disappointed and surprised by the views of the director-general and we are considering what further steps we should take <e>", "<cs> my lords they are connected in the sense that they constitute agreements which were reached at the
