["<cs> as chairman of an education committee for about years i cannot see anything fundamentally wrong with the amendment <e> <s> there is a tendency on the part of governors to restrict the constitutional governors appointed to local education authorities so that they are not broad-based enough to help boys and girls at that stage <e> <s> however i wish to refute one statement boys and girls in secondary schools do visit industry they have careers officers to assist them and the teachers are not simply academic <e> <s> in many cases they have experience of the outside world <e> <s> in my view the inclusion of the amendment would assist local authorities to broaden the base about which i have spoken <e> <s> after all we are entering a changed pattern of society <e> <s> the technology of our future generations is bound to have an impact on the social community and its economic input and it is therefore desirable to broaden the base of governors in that sense <e> <s> i know from experience that these people tend to be inbred so to speak to want to retain their own function <e> <s> speaking from long experience of these matters chairman of six governing bodies chairman of an education committee for many years and having had long experience of applying articles of management and articles of governors i am certain <e>", "<cs> we are concerned mainly with the constitution of the governors <e> <s> the curriculum is a matter which does not enter into it at this stage <e> <s> we are trying to broaden the base of the governors so that there is personal contact with industry <e> <s> curricula are taught by the teachers <e> <s> i say this with respect <e> <s> there is too much interference with the curricula and too much expert advice about what should be taught in the school without realising significantly what is taught in the school <e> <s> experts from the department of education and science may visit a school twice and suddenly make up their minds that there must be a change in the curriculum <e> <s> we are not talking about curricula but about the constitution of the governors <e> <s> is the future constitution of governors to be along certain lines <e> <s> they should represent industry agriculture and commerce <e> <s> we should confine ourselves to that <e> <s> if the government are concerned as i said earlier about relating to industry i do not see how they can object very seriously to this amendment <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord who said that sometimes we are concerned mainly to retain power <e> <s> this amendment broadens the base of future governing bodies <e>", "<cs> they know me in cardiff <e> <s> there is no need to refer to them because they have knowledge of me over the years <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has said that there is not much difference between us <e> <s> if that is the case why can she not agree <e> <s> we are asking the local education authorities to broaden their base <e> <s> in the area i come from it does not necessarily mean there would be a representative of agriculture <e> <s> if one lives in a rural area one would have a representative of agriculture <e> <s> the normal size of a governing body is about and i am pretty certain that within the confines of that one can find sufficient representation <e> <s> this is not really prescribing anything <e> <s> we are really saying to the local education authorities for goodness <e>", "<cs> surely the government must lay down the principles on which these boards of governors operate <e> <s> will it not be the case that administrative officers will make the secretary of state aware of the fact that in accordance with the articles of government the person concerned has exceeded the time in which he or she may be eligible to be a member of the governing body <e> <s> the secretary of state will not have the opportunity of scrutinising these matters throughout the country but surely the appropriate administrative officers will draw the ministers attention to that fact <e>", "<cs> in considering any new act of parliament surely we profit from experience <e> <s> i assume that the amendment before us this evening is one drawn from experience <e> <s> i am pretty certain that it was the intention of the noble baroness to talk in terms of curricula which is the broad base on which teachers talk in terms of careers careers masters who have contact with industry and give guidance to the children <e> <s> those are factors within the curricula of a school <e>", "<cs> can the noble baroness tell us why then the government decided to include parents <e> <s> what is the justification for that and for having teachers <e> <s> i have experienced both among governing bodies <e> <s> can the noble baroness tell us what contribution they are likely to make to the administration of the school <e> <s> that is the point that the <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment by just illustrating one point very clearly <e> <s> there was a physically handicapped boy we got into our secondary school and through careful teaching at the school the lad eventually went to university where he obtained a degree <e> <s> we got him teaching at our physically handicapped school in penarth and i want to say that it was an inspiration to those handicapped people to believe that there was one at least who by courage and endurance and with the assistance of others was able to overcome his handicap <e> <s> i am certain that by supporting this amendment we shall be doing something at least for the handicapped <e> <s> we probably built the first school in the whole country in penarth making a broad basis for the physically handicapped child <e> <s> i am certain in my own mind that having people who arc connected with the handicapped and people who have associations with the school will make a contribution and it will be an inspiration to all those who are in the school <e>", "<cs> one accepts the philosophy of trying to educate the children within a normal school because it is done with partially deaf children and with a variety of other children <e> <s> but there are special schools one cannot call them by any other name <e> <s> there are schools for the mentally and the physically handicapped <e> <s> there is a variety of handicaps <e> <s> therefore they are schools which are distinct and different <e> <s> we are saying that because of the character and nature of these special schools they should have representation on the governing body that is distinctly related to that school <e> <s> they are in a special category <e> <s> i have been the governor and chairman of mentally and physically handicapped schools and i know what an inspiration it has been to handicapped people <e> <s> the psychological importance is that the handicapped will go into the school and take the same responsibilities as a person who is not handicapped <e>", "<cs> the situation is left completely open under subsection <e> <s> anyone could be appointed under that subsection it is possible for a carthorse to drive through it <e> <s> it is very clear <e> <s> we in some instances have appointed members of the non-teaching staff <e> <s> it is not a question of negotiation <e> <s> when there is a matter pertaining to salaries and teacher posts as such they are not permitted to be present when it is discussed <e> <s> it is part of the statutory obligation which a local authority has when it administers governing bodies <e>", "<cs> we are talking about the articles of government in relation to the appointment of people and returning to the last point the minister made we must remember that the election of these governors is the responsibility of the local education authority <e> <s> the amendment merely suggests that if we are to have governors there shall be a method of selection <e> <s> what is wrong with that <e> <s> that is not taking anything away from the local authoritythey are the controlling body who have statutory obligations for their area <e> <s> the amendment is saying and saying clearly that this is the method we should like to see adopted <e> <s> as i said last night we are dealing with a <e>", "<cs> may i assume from the statement of the minister that he logically applies the same reasoning right through this matter and that the local authority can do this <e> <s> if they want to do what is implied in the amendment can they do it <e>", "<cs> is it the case that under the bill one can have a single governing body for a primary school and a secondary school <e> <s> is that correct or have i misunderstood the noble baroness lady young <e> <s> her previous argument based on the grounds of expense has gone out of the window because if each one of those schools is serviced this will double or treble the expense of the administrative authority if there are single group governing bodies <e> <s> i wondered whether i had heard the noble baroness correctly because on the grounds of economics it is absolutely out <e>", "<cs> in my own area which is a large area primary schools and secondary schools are grouped for the purpose of making savings in staff <e> <s> if we have single-group primary schools and single-group governing bodies and if they have to be serviced and meetings held on different dates it is going to be rather expensive to the local authority <e> <s> that is what my director of education tells me <e>", "<cs> the normal practice is for those consultations to take place <e> <s> from my long experience i can say that if there is any change in the pattern of the articles of managers or governors the normal consultation takes place with the department of education and science <e> <s> in my mind that is the normal pattern of administrative response between those in the department and those who are administering education in the field <e>", "<cs> on the subject of standardisation we must remember that the articles respecting governors are standard throughout the country <e> <s> such articles relating to the control of schools whether maintained or otherwise are more or less uniform <e> <s> that is certainly the case in wales <e> <s> therefore in administrative terms there is already a type of standardisation <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> i have been talking to many directors and administrators of education and they are very worried about the wide interpretation which might be put on parental choice <e> <s> i thought that section of the act was quite clear about parental choice and that should have been sufficient <e> <s> in north wales there is a clash between the teaching of welsh and english in schools which can create problems <e> <s> is it suggested that english parents in gwynedd can send their children across the border and that the gwynedd education authority should make payment <e> <s> you can drive <e>", "<cs> since section has acted as the fundamental basis upon which parents exercise a choice <e> <s> would the noble lord tell me what is wrong with it <e>", "<cs> i was talking of teaching through the medium of welsh <e> <s> there is an essential difference between teaching through the medium of welsh and a bilingual school where you teach through the medium of the mother-tongue either english or welsh <e> <s> what i am saying is that you are going to run into all kinds of legal problems <e>", "<cs> do we understand from this provision that it is partial parental choice within regulations <e> <s> let us get the situation perfectly clear <e> <s> the noble baroness has said that it cannot be full parental choice so therefore it can only be partial parental choice <e> <s> can we have the situation perfectly clear <e>", "<cs> i believe the noble lord lord belstead is going to answer the points made by the noble lord <e> <s> the first time i met the noble lord lord belstead was when i came to discuss comprehensive education with him <e> <s> on that particular occasion in order to <e>", "<cs> would the appeals committee be a sub-committee of the education committee <e>", "<cs> made up of whom <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who has spent years in local government may i ask the minister to tell us what is good value for money in local government <e>", "<cs> my lords having been involved in the preliminary discussions between the local authority and the national coal board may i say that certain difficulties have been overcome <e> <s> first the question if its being adjacent to margam park has been overcome and secondly the question of planning has been resolved and we were looking forward in this area from which i come bearing in mind the tremendous amount of coal that is under the ground something we know as a result of the boring that has been done to development taking place in the area <e> <s> we felt that <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the house my lords i am more used to speaking at local authority meetings <e> <s> is the minister aware that developments were we felt going to take place in the area <e> <s> port talbot has suffered grievously from the rundown that has taken place <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that port talbot has suffered greatly from the rundown of <e>", "<cs> i thought a decision had been taken my lords <e> <s> there has been a statement in the press that they are not going forward with this development and that is of great concern to the people of the area from which i come <e> <s> if the minister says no decision has yet been taken <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that despite his statement that no decision has yet been taken statements have appeared in the press to the effect that no development is to take place in the area <e> <s> i am merely asking the noble lord if the government will reconsider the matter in negotiation with the ncb <e>"]
