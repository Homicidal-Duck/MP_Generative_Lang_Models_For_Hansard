["<cs> my lords i crave your indulgence for this my maiden speech <e> <s> having a small interest in development i thought that this debate would be easier than some others in which to make my maiden speech <e> <s> however having risen to my feet i am now somewhat uncertain <e>", "<cs> my lords over recent years the government have taken a number of steps to reduce the nuisance that can be caused by careless or inconsiderate burning of straw and stubble <e> <s> the indications are that there have been fewer problems during this years harvest season <e> <s> a combination of strengthened by-laws the publicity campaign mounted by the government the code of practice issued by the national farmers union and the introduction of the highways amendment act will undoubtedly have contributed greatly to this improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords first i thank the noble baroness for her very kind remarks <e> <s> i hope that they are justified <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid the short answer to that question is no <e> <s> there have been most encouraging improvements <e> <s> in per cent <e> <s> of the straw that was available in this country was burnt <e> <s> that figure fell to per cent <e> <s> last year and i hope it will continue to fall <e> <s> it is far easier for some farmers to cease straw-burning because of the nature of the ground that they farm <e> <s> there are many farmers in this country who would find it impossible to cease and to move directly to incorporation of straw <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are spending million annually considering alternative uses for the remaining million tonnes of straw which is what the problem is all about <e> <s> the government are certainly looking at building board <e> <s> however one of the great difficulties that has occurred with that alternative use has been the collapse in the price of oil which has proved a number of the avenues of research to be less attractive than they were a short while ago <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first thank the noble lord for his very kind remarks <e> <s> i particularly accept his statement concerning diseases in the ground <e> <s> we are well aware that for example in heavy clay soils there are serious potential disease problems <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may thank the noble lord very much for his kind remarks <e> <s> we do not have the figures for <e> <s> however from to the figures have fallen by the equivalent of per cent <e> <s> and there is every reason to believe that they will continue to fall <e>", "<cs> my lords again i thank the noble lord for his very kind remarks <e> <s> i am sure that everyone in this house agrees that it is an industry which in some ways has been the victim of its own success <e> <s> however i believe that the farming industry as a whole is making a tremendous effort to remove this problem of which it is becoming more and more aware <e> <s> the ministry and the national farmers union have done a great deal of work to make the farmers responsible <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his kind remark <e> <s> however the evidence is that wildlife is having a better and better time with the regulations that have been introduced and the by-laws of and <e> <s> if i was living in a hedgerow i should be very happy about the way things are looking <e>", "<cs> my lords again i should like to thank my noble friend for his kind remarks and take the opportunity of agreeing with much of what he said <e> <s> that is why the government do not propose to ban straw-burning at this time <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish that i was as good a farmer as the noble lord lord mackie so that i would know about the finer points of his question <e>", "<cs> my lords the estimated number of hip replacement operations in national health service hospitals in the united kingdom in the earliest year for which figures are available was <e> <s> in the latest year for which information is available centrally the figure was <e> <s> we do not have information on the numbers of operations performed in private hospitals <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord campbell is absolutely right <e> <s> hip replacements are an example of an operation that was virtually unheard of years ago but is now widespread <e> <s> more patients can be treated in a way which greatly enhances the quality of their lives <e> <s> there are many other examples of this same feature among them coronary artery by-pass grafts <e> <s> the opportunities for expansion in treatment are almost limitless but resources never can be <e> <s> priorities have to be set <e> <s> hip replacements are one such <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his question <e> <s> i am afraid that i am unable to answer the first part but will note it and will hope to be able to provide an answer for him at a later time <e> <s> however in hip replacements were carried out <e> <s> the figure for was which is an increase of per cent <e> <s> under this government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for the question <e> <s> however i think it is slightly beyond the remit which i have <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend for his question <e> <s> his question to me is very similar to the one which i ask myself <e> <s> i hope that we shall be able to benefit from computerisation and be able to provide much more accurate and up-to-date information as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i am again grateful for the question <e> <s> with regard to the first part of it i must remind the noble lord that there is a point of diminishing returns with acquiring facts and information because we may finish up with more people counting outside the operating theatres than people going in <e> <s> with regard to the second part it is a very similar question to the one which i asked <e> <s> the answer i was given was that until this time it has never been thought that there should be any reason why the private sector should report to the national health service on the numbers <e> <s> i am sure that that matter will be reviewed <e>", "<cs> my lords to the best of my knowledge waiting lists are actually falling <e> <s> however the figures if noble lords would like them are these <e> <s> on th september the latest date for which we have a figure people were awaiting in-patient treatment in the specialty of trauma and orthopaedic surgery many of them waiting for hip replacements <e> <s> unfortunately at the moment we do not have a breakdown of those who are waiting for hip replacements or other forms of this type of surgery <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that question which i can answer very simply <e> <s> the average is <e>", "<cs> my lords as i replied to a similar question earlier it has never before been thought necessary to have these figures available <e> <s> however i am sure that in the not-too-distant future i shall be able to answer that question <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that question but unfortunately i cannot give the break-down figure <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only confirm what my noble friend lord campbell has said and agree with him <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend told the house on th october the government have taken urgent action on a number of fronts <e> <s> these include a public information campaign additional resources for treatment training of national health service staff research testing of all blood donations funding for voluntary organisations and the issue of advice to professionals <e>", "<cs> my lords it is right to say that the wise words of the right reverend prelate the bishop of birmingham yesterday are as true an answer as any to preventing the fast spread of this disease <e> <s> there exists already interdepartmental machinery to co-ordinate action on aids <e> <s> our concern is that the campaign is conducted as efficiently and as effectively as possible and it needs to be sustained for some years <e> <s> we are currently considering how best it can be run in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord mellish for his question <e> <s> i was unaware that there was going to be compulsory testing of blood <e> <s> the governments current policy is that public education is the most effective way of combating the spread of the disease <e> <s> other possibilities that might be of value have already been examined <e> <s> we have already made provision for the testing of individuals but there are certainly no plans at the moment to introduce mass compulsory testing and screening which would involve formidable problems both of principle and practice not the least being the question of what should be done with those who prove positive <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for the question <e> <s> one of the great problems about this disease is that the prospects for a cure look extremely bleak <e> <s> the prospects for a vaccine are possibly somewhat better <e> <s> however the fact of the matter is that at the moment the department is providing funding for all worthy programmes that have been put before it to date <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord campbell for his very good question <e> <s> the situation at the moment is that the department is in receipt of the scottish report concerning this particular problem <e> <s> it is studying the report very closely and will shortly be deciding <e>", "<cs> my lords facilities are available for those who wish to be tested because they feel they may be at risk <e> <s> we see no need at present for people who are not in the high risk groups to come forward for testing <e> <s> at the moment the facilities are there to be taken advantage of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all noble lords are well aware of the extremely comprehensive regulations laid down already before the outbreak of this disease concerning all who work in the food and catering industry <e> <s> the hiv positive food handlers do not pose a particular risk provided standard hygiene precautions are taken <e> <s> as noble lords are aware stringent regulations already apply to people working in the food industry and in restaurants <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that i do not have an answer to that at this moment <e> <s> i should be more than happy to write to the noble lord on the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords there is considerable joint action taking place as i am sure all noble lords are aware <e> <s> however today i am in receipt of information only of the specific nature of what is happening in this country <e> <s> from what i have read and no doubt the <e>", "<cs> my lords to the best of the departments knowledge no there is not <e>", "<cs> my lords at the moment rubber gloves are available on the basis that i suppose is described as pre-aids <e> <s> i shall inquire on behalf of the noble baroness and write to her in answer on the subject

"<cs> my lords during occupational therapy students and speech therapy students were in training in the united kingdom <e> <s> a total of applications were received for first-year places for occupational therapy students <e> <s> information is not collected centrally on the number of applicants for the speech therapy places <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for her question <e> <s> the results of a survey conducted by the association of directors of the social services last year suggests that for england and wales there was a shortfall of per cent <e> <s> against funded posts <e> <s> this was due to the greater rate of expansion of posts compared with the increases in training places <e>", "<cs> my lords the department is already proposing to expand the number of places in training <e> <s> the department provided extra bursaries to students entering training in september of this year bringing the total number of centrally funded bursaries to out of the available total of within england and wales <e> <s> with the help of three of the thames regions we have commissioned the opening of a new school at christ church college canterbury in september next

lords i do not have the answer to my noble friends question <e> <s> i shall arrange to write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord northfield for opening this short debate <e> <s> a number of important questions have been raised and i hope that in passing on some of my very newly-acquired knowledge i may be able to put minds at rest <e> <s> i arrived armed with a veritable array of confetti for the debate today and before dealing with my speech proper i should like to deal with some specific points that were raised during the debate that are not contained in my speaking notes <e> <s> the subject is complicated enough as it is without making it more difficult for your lordships to understand <e>", "<cs> my apologies my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may move on to the next point on applications treated <e> <s> importers have been warned that an application is not a licence <e> <s> they will be pursued if they make that foolish error <e>", "<cs> my lords the number of importers is rather than <e> <s> as i said earlier the vast number of cases concern irregularities to do with packaging or labelling <e> <s> it could be said that we are doing a very good job in pursuing so many <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that it will come as no surprise to the noble lord that i shall be writing to him rather than answering him at this time <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords point is taken and i shall be writing to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until <e>", "<cs> my lords although the number of qualified nursing and midwifery staff continues to increase we are well aware of the situation regarding recruitment to nurse training and the difficulties that are likely to occur due to the reduction in the number of year-old school-leavers with the appropriate qualifications <e> <s> in welcoming the publication of the united kingdom central councils proposals for the reform of nurse education and training in project my honourable friend the minister for health announced on tuesday that a major feasibility study into the extended use of the youth training scheme in the national health service was being set up <e> <s> a feature of this study is to look at the way in which such training might facilitate entry to professional nursing training and thus help to alleviate nurse recruitment difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords a crisis will only arise if recruitment and retention patterns remain the same <e> <s> i can assure the house that action is currently being taken to overcome any problems which might arise <e> <s> in addition to the feasibility study to which i have just referred health authorities have been asked to consider increasing male recruitment and to make greater efforts to recruit mature entrants <e> <s> they have also been asked to organise back to nursing campaigns to establish nurse banks and to give more opportunities for flexible working arrangements part-time working and job sharing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble baroness is possibly correct but i do not know whether improved child care facilities are part of the governments programme <e>", "<cs> my lords the shortage of appears on the surface to be correct but that figure is made up every year by people coming back into the nursing profession <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness lady lane-fox for her question <e> <s> there are incentives to maintain nurses in the profession <e> <s> the most recent pay increases from st july gave nurses an increase of per cent <e> <s> a year on basic rates at a time when inflation was running at per cent <e> <s> even now with inflation running at about per cent <e> <s> that represents a substantial increase <e>", "<cs> my lords the department is jointly sponsoring with the manpower services commission the united kingdom central council for nursing midwifery and health visiting and the national health service training authority a feasibility study which will explore the scope for expanding the range of opportunities available through the yts to young people who wish to make a career in caring <e> <s> one feature of the study is to look at the way such training might facilitiate entry into professional nursing training <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to my noble friends first question i do not know the exact date when the study will be finished <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that many of your lordships were here yesterday when we had a <e>", "<cs> my lords the department has always had a policy that the recruitment of nurses is encouraged and completely organised on a regional basis <e>", "<cs> my lords under the current rates of pay the basic starting rate for a staff nurse is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that many members of your lordships house will agree with that <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a most useful if very short debate <e> <s> i am very grateful for the contributions made by both noble lords lord john-mackie and lord hougton of sowerby <e> <s> to answer the first two points that were brought up by the noble lord lord john-mackie the government are following the advice of the farm animal welfare council <e> <s> we are not in any way proposing completely to eliminate for ever the lesser of the two forms of action <e> <s> we have taken the advice of the farm animal welfare council and on that basis we shall conduct a trial <e> <s> i know that some people might feel that there are others who should possibly be able to conduct their own trials at the same time <e> <s> as i said in my opening speech in order to try to avoid making the wrong exemptions we have had to limit the scope to its present form <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall investigate this matter and write to the noble lord lord john-mackie <e>", "<cs> my lords the exceptionally cold weather payment scheme was amended from th january to provide that this extra help will be available to supplementary benefit claimants in the qualifying groups when the average temperature for an area falls to degrees celsius or less over a fixed seven-day period <e> <s> this replaces the previous temperature threshold of minus degrees celsius <e> <s> this change means that help is now likely to be given more often than under any previous scheme of exceptionally severe cold weather payments <e>", "<cs> my lords the social security advisory committee comments that the proposals put to it represent a significant improvement on previous schemes <e> <s> the system has never been intended to give help in most winters only when it is exceptionally <e>", "<cs> my lords i doubt whether any scheme will ever be seen as fully satisfactory <e> <s> we have devised a system which provides a reasonable solution judged over the years <e> <s> severe winters are not themselves alike <e> <s> we cannot keep trying to devise a system based on one years experience <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for his question <e> <s> however it is thought particularly by the social security advisory committee that the current arrangements are a great improvement on previous arrangements where for instance there had to be a comparison of bills which meant that people often did not receive money until long after they had been charged by the electricity or gas board <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his question <e> <s> we do not have the figures for the most recent cold spell <e> <s> we have the majority of the figures for last year which show some claims <e> <s> we have compared those figures with when there were just payments <e> <s> we believe that the number will rise because of the simplification of the system <e>", "<cs> my lords there will always be objections to whatever system is chosen <e> <s> the social security advisory committee understood the objections <e> <s> however it supported the fixed period because of its advantages of simplicity ease of <e>", "<cs> my lords it is most important to remember that we are talking about an exceptional cold weather payment <e> <s> there is already the basis below that which provides for and accepts the protection of the old and those least able to care for themselves in society <e>", "<cs> my lords i am as aware as are other noble lords in the house that this matter has been a source of contention <e> <s> however the government have gone to considerable effort to improve the situation <e> <s> in just weather stations were used compared with weather stations which were used this year <e> <s> there will always be arguments <e> <s> however i do believe that this represents a substantial improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for her question <e> <s> it is most important not only that the money is available but that it is actually claimed <e> <s> revised instructions have been issued to local offices on publicity when the conditions for payment are met <e> <s> this includes local press advertisements and wide distribution of a special leaflet both containing a claim form for help <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most interested in that question <e> <s> i should like to point out that all pensioners over the age of actually receive a further a year heating allowance <e>", "<cs> my lords we are urgently considering how best to ensure that essential information about aids reaches people from ethnic minorities particularly those who have difficulty reading and understanding english in ways that are sensitive to the needs of each community <e> <s> on th february my honourable friend the minister for health attended a meeting with representatives of the ethnic press <e> <s> the department will consider carefully all the views expressed in devising a strategy for carrying <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord ennals will be aware this is a sensitive subject <e> <s> the reason for the meeting on th february was to establish the requirements and feelings of certain ethnic minorities <e> <s> we have already started to consider certain aspects and we are trying to make progress as fast as possible <e> <s> the department is considering a request from the league of chinese for funding to help them to produce and distribute an aids leaflet to addresses throughout the country <e> <s> at the meeting on th february other ideas were discussed which are being taken seriously and considered at this time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am unable to answer the noble lords question on this occasion because i am unaware of the newcastle hematologist but i shall write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords on television there has been a heavy emphasis on the subject for this very reason <e> <s> at the present time the department is also looking at special groups of the disabled where there are problems such as those mentioned by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to thank the noble lord for his thanks <e> <s> secondly i cannot give him details of the precise number of languages but there are a number of different languages under discussion <e> <s> i am aware of this fact from a document which i read two days ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not an expert in the field in which the noble lord has raised the point <e>", "<cs> my lords while the advocacy alliance has not published an evaluation of the project i understand it considers that this small-scale project has successfully established the advocacy scheme in the three hospitals and has provided a model of good practice for elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his supplementary question <e> <s> advocacy alliance has to date received agreement to grants totalling from the department of health and social security <e> <s> this however meets only part of the running costs of the organisation over the period in question the balance of expenses as with most voluntary organisations in receipt of government funds coming from donations by a wide range of bodies and individuals <e> <s> in the case of advocacy alliance this has included contributions from other parts of the voluntary sector including parent organisations such as mencap <e>", "<cs> my lords an independent evaluation of the project was undertaken by the rowntree trust <e> <s> publication of this evaluation is currently under consideration by the trust and advocacy alliance <e>", "<cs> my lords while the projects were strictly limited in location and in the numbers of hospital residents selected to be involved and while there were difficulties in recruiting and retaining advocates it is clear following discussions between officials and representatives of advocacy alliance that given sufficient training of advocates and co-operation from the hospital authorities and staff an advocate may make a significant contribution to improvement in the quality of a hospital residents life <e>", "<cs> my lords the government attach particular importance to this issue and food from britains work in this area <e> <s> since food from britain has spent about million in improving marketing most of it provided by the government

million and as he rightly points out it is not an area where the government need to give assistance as regards marketing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am going to have to write to the noble lord on that question <e>", "<cs> so far as i am aware yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that there is a problem now <e>", "<cs> my lords the underlying causes of the annual winter increase in the number of deaths are very complex <e> <s> the underlying trend in excess winter mortality has been downward over the last years but it remains a matter of great concern <e> <s> we need to gain more knowledge of the factors involved <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social services is considering how that can be best achieved <e> <s> meanwhile the government are spending some million per year in supplementary benefit heating additions to help supplementary pensioners and others on low incomes to meet their fuel bills <e>", "<cs> my lords the government recognise the valuable co-ordinating role performed by neighbourhood energy action of which the noble lord is chairman <e> <s> we also fully recognise the value of draughtproofing measures and of the important work undertaken by local insulation projects <e> <s> future arrangements to help with the cost of draughtproofing materials are being considered by the government departments concerned in the context of the governments help to people on low incomes with energy conservation measures as a whole <e> <s> i appreciate the concern that has been expressed about the need for an early announcement but it is still too early to say what the outcome of this consideration will be <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a rather confusing number of questions <e> <s> as regards the deaths they were certainly not all related to hypothermia <e> <s> cold weather has of course always caused a rise in the death rate and the problem of the additional number of deaths from all causes which is what the figure of refers to particularly heart disease strokes and chest infections that occur in winter compared with the summer <e> <s> however excess winter mortality has declined significantly from in excess of per cent <e> <s> from to to per cent <e> <s> from to <e>", "<cs> my lords the government make a special provision of an extra per annum to all those who achieve the age of and above <e>",

winter the health education council has issued two training packs one of which is entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for my noble friends observation <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that i have already answered this question of the noble baroness who i know is the vice-chairman of neighbourhood energy action when i answered the questions of the noble lord lord ezra <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is generally considered that with each passing year the data that are collected and their quality are improving <e> <s> we hope this will assist the government in providing answers to the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment is expected to make an announcement shortly <e> <s> there is no reason for householders to remove man-made mineral fibres from their lofts but they should take simple precautions such as wearing masks gloves etc <e> <s> when working in lofts where the insulation is exposed

technical defect in the act to carry that programme through <e> <s> i shall not go over all that ground again but i should like to respond briefly to some of the points that have been made this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i should indeed like to write to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord kilmarnock for his question and i shall write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords the objective of the governments public education campaign is to create a general awareness of the facts about aids how the disease is transmitted and how the spread of infection can be controlled <e> <s> the results of the latest gallup poll survey commissioned by the department are most encouraging and show that these objectives are being met <e> <s> there is evidence too that the campaign is helping to dispel some of the groundless fears of infection and that fewer people now appear to be worried about catching aids through normal social contact <e> <s> the government will continue to monitor the effectiveness of the campaign and will of course take account of findings in the development of future strategy <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his supplementary question <e> <s> we are undertaking direct research with regard to teenagers both before and after the programmes currently being broadcast this week <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the noble lords question <e> <s> unfortunately i did not see the programme to which he referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept those two points but i am not sure that there is very much that the government can do about that attitude <e>", "<cs> my lords as always the noble earl provides fascinating information <e>", "<cs> my lords there are really two parts to that question <e> <s> with regard to the governments own directly commissioned activities such as the aids leaflet and the television campaign there were million leaflets sent out and we have received letters of complaint so i feel that we have got it just about right <e> <s> with regard to television advertisements the noble lord lord chalfont is probably referring to a series of advertisements that were commissioned by <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always rather difficult to strike a happy medium <e> <s> clearly it is important that we should communicate in language that young people understand and use themselves <e> <s> the campaign will continue to be direct and will pull no punches but being explicit does not necessarily have to mean using four letter words which can stand in the way of communication <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the contributions which your lordships have made to this debate <e> <s> as i said at the outset much of what is in these regulations is time-honoured practice from other regulations which have been put into this instrument <e> <s> the change to a single test for recoverability of overpayments is a simplification which i am sure will be welcomed <e> <s> i recognise that a change to a test for misrepresentation and failure to disclose all benefits will not have been universally welcomed but i have explained the governments reasons for choosing the single test which is now in the social security act <e> <s> these regulations simply give effect to the principle of recovery which has already been agreed <e>", "<cs> my lords lewisham and north southwark health authority is committed to the continued use of the former st olaves hospital site for nhs and general community purposes and a -place nursing home called st olaves home will open in april <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a good twofold reason why acute services were transferred from the old st olaves site to guys hospital in the early s <e> <s> first the tremendous technical advances in medicine in recent years have meant that acute beds need the support of complex back-up services which are available only in major district general hospitals such as guys or lewisham <e> <s> however what smaller hospitals can provide is community care <e> <s> provision for elderly people the mentally ill and the mentally handicapped has been neglected for too long generally and especially so in london <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will know we have the plans which i outlined to him <e> <s> in answer to his supplementary question concerning acute beds the difficulty is as i have tried to explain <e> <s> i should add that in december ministers agreed to a million scheme at guys hospital to provide a further beds and day places <e> <s> that is in relation to the example which i gave earlier concerning the need for back-up for acute beds <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the point which my noble friend has made and i shall bring that matter to the attention of the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to write to the noble lord on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords the proposal as it stands at the moment is three-fold <e> <s> first it will provide a -place residential <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had an interesting debate this afternoon and a very large number of points have been raised <e> <s> i shall try to respond to as many of them as possible but if i do not cover any particular point i shall write to the noble lord or the noble baroness who made it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his interjection <e> <s> i shall

made in the debate <e> <s> as might be expected the debate has thrown up a number of differing views on farm animal welfare <e> <s> the government in tabling the documents before the house have tried

trustees when discussing the matter as a whole decided quite rightly which is why one has a board of trustees to preserve the paintings <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a most interesting and in some ways a riveting debate <e> <s> at the start i should like to make two short comments <e> <s> in some areas we have covered a rather broader area than the question on the order paper <e> <s> we have also touched upon some important aspects of philosophy in a way which suggests that we may have another and longer debate in the future in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the natural environment research council plans to spend million over five years from on a study of water quality in the north sea <e> <s> in addition my right honourable friend the minister of agriculture fisheries and food is contributing million to the study <e> <s> i also expect my own department to be able to contribute to some parts of the programme of most relevance to its own responsibilities <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will be well aware that at the recent conference on the north sea one of the main aims that were discussed and agreed was to reduce the input of dangerous substances into rivers by per cent <e> <s> by <e> <s> it was also proposed that there should be no increase in the level of input of contaminants and sewage sludge <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have introduced a substantial duty differential in favour of unleaded petrol and will be requiring all new cars to be capable of using the new fuel by october <e> <s> we have taken a number of initiatives to promulgate information on unleaded petrol where it can be obtained and which cars can use it <e>", "<cs> my lords beyond the government offering the advantage of the reduced rate of duty on such petrol there are no plans to offer further financial inducements <e> <s> however i should point out to your lordships house that most motor cars can be adjusted at very little cost to take unleaded fuel and thus should be able to take immediate advantage of the cheaper prices at the pump <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey would like to put down a question on catalytic converters i shall be more than happy to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords the proposals in the housing bill are aimed at increasing the amount of rented accommodation available <e> <s> we are continuing to encourage local authorities and others to make better use of the existing housing stock especially for priority categories of the homeless <e> <s> to assist the provision of appropriate accommodation the minister for housing and planning announced on th march additional resources and measures directed at authorities with the most acute homelessness pressures <e>", "<cs>

shall certainly draw the remarks of the noble lord <e> <s> lord mellish to the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware as are we all that homelessness is centred in the inner cities <e> <s> however it is not a matter for the government alone <e> <s> the clear fact is i give this example that from st april both camden and hammersmith had million of accumulated capital receipts which they would he entirely within their rights to spend on the to council dwellings which they have respectively and which were awaiting major repairs at that time <e> <s> at the same time they also had some families in bed and breakfast accommodation <e> <s> they have at their own executive level the ability to remove a large section of the problem which confronts them <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are well aware not only of the need but of the desire for rented property <e> <s> the reason that the housing bill will come before this house shortly is to ensure the increase and availability of rented accommodation <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards capitalised repairs local authorities do not have to abide by the per cent <e> <s> regulation for phasing <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i shall certainly bring my noble friends remarks to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no one simple answer to the problem of homelessness <e> <s> the government have initiated a number of programmes which range from the large such as the housing bill due to come before this house to the latest increased special sums of money that have been allocated to stress areas which the noble lord lord dean of beswick very kindly pointed out <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lords question is probably beyond my competence to answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to write to the noble countess on that specific point <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are sympathetic to mother teresas work and concerns <e> <s> we are concerned with the level of homelessness and to this end we have recently announced an additional allocation of million to be targeted on those authorities with particular homeless pressures <e> <s> the department of health and social security also has responsibility for providing temporary board and lodging for people with an unsettled way of life <e>", "<cs> my lords if a local authority wishes to commence new builds it may use per cent <e> <s> of those accumulated receipts <e>", "<cs> my lords the european commissions detailed legal rules for set-aside are expected to be adopted very shortly <e> <s> only then will the government be in a position to determine how the scheme might be applied in the united kingdom <e> <s> an announcement will be made as soon as possible so that the scheme can apply for the marketing year <e> <s> decisions on the extensification scheme which will depend on detailed commission rules yet to be proposed must await a later stage <e>", "<cs> my lords we are considering whether this option should apply in the united kingdom <e> <s> it has environmental advantages <e> <s> we are concerned about the impact it might have on the livestock sector there are also the difficulties of control <e> <s> as regards this proposal we have argued very strongly for very tightly drawn community rules <e>", "<cs> my lords we are required by ec legislation to have the scheme in place by st july <e> <s> the difficulty to date has been in finalising the rules <e> <s> that is part of the point to which the noble lord lord carter referred <e> <s> we cannot actually devise the regulations <e> <s> i hope however that very shortly this will be done <e>", "<cs> my lords in a way upland farmers already have an extensification policy by the very nature of their method of farming <e> <s> in some ways it can be said that they set an example to us all <e>", "<cs> my lords this question will depend upon the finalisation of the rules in brussels <e> <s> as i have said i hope that this matter will be dealt with very shortly <e> <s> perhaps i may also take the opportunity of attempting i believe that to be the right word to answer the question of my noble friend lord renton <e> <s> i hope very much that more and more farmers are beginning to understand the meaning of the word extensification <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope very much that one of the net results of the two items set-aside and extensification raised by todays question will be what the noble lord lord carter has just described <e>", "<cs> my lords the basis of employment in the creation of food will at the end of the day be decided by the consumer <e>", "<cs> my lords the government thoroughly support the objectives of british food and farming year and hope that it will be successful in creating a wider understanding of the important role which the food and farming industries play in the national life <e> <s> the department is represented on the organising council for the year and is closely involved with progress on what is planned <e> <s> it would take me too long to list all the projects which are planned for the year but i will willingly place a list of the main ones in the library <e> <s> in addition the department is co-ordinating its centenary celebrations with all these activities <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord carter is entirely right to say that it will be a major commemoration <e> <s> a major two-part television documentary is to be produced by the bbc <e> <s> the ministry itself will be making a grant of directly towards it <e> <s> however i must remind your lordships that this is essentially an industry celebration <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i am entirely qualified to answer that question <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is obviously aware of something of which i am totally unaware <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that that may be too specialised a question but if the noble lord wishes to put down a question on that subject i shall be more than happy to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until pm <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords before commending the order to your lordships house i shall attempt to answer some of the noble lords questions <e> <s> his observation concerning the number of houses or types of houses included in the scheme and the discrepancy between the original figure and the figure we are at now is an entirely correct one <e> <s> the number of houses the types of houses has only in fact increased by two which is the smith that he represented and the boswell <e> <s> the reason for the rather substantial increase in numbers which would give the impression that there were more than that is that the number of houses that would be eligible was rather underestimated in the first place which is in fact where the rest of that differential comes about <e>", "<cs> my lords since the introduction of the hda-nhbc scheme there has been a positive attitude from the building societies and an improvement on that score <e> <s> that is as far as i can go tonight <e> <s> i hope that that satisfies the noble lord <e>", "<cs> very well my lords <e> <s> without further ado i commend the order to your lordships house <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may suggest that now would be a convenient moment

<s> discount from the personal community charge <e> <s> it is entirely understandable that the committee should wish to ensure that nurses and student nurses in particular are fairly treated and that the valuable contribution they make to the community is properly recognised <e>", "<cs> i shall shortly be referring to that subject <e> <s> however there is a transitional period which is indicated by the fact that project is being adopted <e> <s> the period will be transitional both in england and in scotland but of course there will be anomalies <e>", "<cs> the simplest answer would of course be if the whole of project were implemented on the same day <e> <s> however that will never happen <e> <s> when the recommendations are implemented and assuming that the qualifying conditions concerning supervised study and similar matters are met student nurses will automatically become students for the purposes of the community charge <e> <s> no amendment to the primary legislation will be needed to achieve that result <e>", "<cs> there are differences in many walks of life <e> <s> i am not entirely sure whether that issue will take the debate much further this evening <e>", "<cs> that is not quite what i said <e> <s> as the noble lord is well aware only a few moments ago i mentioned to my noble friend lady faithfull that the department of environment and the department of health and social security were in contact with one another <e> <s> it would not be fair to expect me to go further than the secretary of state for social services did when he made his announcement <e> <s> as soon as the project proposals are fully implemented and all student nurses are trained and reimbursed on the same basis they will of course all be treated in the same way in relation to the community charge <e> <s> i hope therefore that with that assurance the noble baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment <e>", "<cs> if i have understood the question aright if someone in the armed forces is undertaking full-time student training such as a short service commission officer at university i suspect that he will probably be eligible for the discount <e>", "<cs> to an extent i feel that the concession that the government have made has been disregarded <e> <s> it is a substantial concession <e> <s> it is one that will be of great benefit <e> <s> it is slightly saddening that when such a concession is made it is passed by as if it did not exist <e> <s> it is important to understand how far the government have gone to try to provide an equitable and satisfactory settlement <e> <s> i hope that the committee will contemplate what has been done away from the rhetoric and realise that the concession is made in good faith and with a good intention <e>", "<cs> when the scottish legislation was introduced into parliament it was envisaged that students would be liable to pay the full personal community charge like other adults <e> <s> however during parliaments consideration of the legislation doubts were expressed about this proposal and the government decided therefore to make students liable to pay only per cent <e> <s> of the charge <e> <s> the governments intention in the long term is that students should cease to be eligible for social security benefits and should return to the position whereby they are supported by the student award system and parental contributions where appropriate <e> <s> the per cent <e> <s> level of community charge for the students is therefore intended for those full-time students who will not be eligible for rebates <e>", "<cs> i hope very much that the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal will understand that i do not have the details to hand at the moment <e> <s> however i shall check immediately on her specific point and write to her if i may <e>", "<cs> i propose to reply to amendments nos <e> <s> a b d e f and l <e> <s> i have listened with care to the arguments employed by the noble lord in support of these amendments and i did so because i am afraid that their meaning was not altogether obvious from the text on the marshalled list <e> <s> in some cases i suspect that the amendments would not achieve their intended purpose <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i can usefully do more than explain how the bill will work as i have just tried to do <e> <s> i do not believe that there is anything that i can add to that <e> <s> if there is disquiet there is disquiet <e> <s> however that does not affect the technicalities that i have tried to outline this evening <e>", "<cs> i shall first answer my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> a vacation is the same as the term <e> <s> i cannot say how the student grant will be affected by the per cent <e> <s> liability because that matter is currently under consideration by the jackson review <e> <s> however my noble friend lady carnegy asked what the effect of the change would be on students <e> <s> the des has done a survey which shows that on average students currently pay about a year in rates more than the per cent <e> <s> community charge liability will be <e> <s> thus it seems that they will actually be better off under the community charge <e>", "<cs> in answer to the noble lord lord tordoff there is a power to define what is meant by a course in clause <e>", "<cs> i am reliably informed that that point will be covered <e>", "<cs> the scottish regulations have been laid and debated <e>", "<cs> it is the responsibility of my right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland and they have been debated <e>", "<cs> i can only say that i could never know as much about scotland as my noble friend lady carnegy <e> <s> i feel that she pointed out the contradiction here as i hope i did in a

relevant facts if and when a change becomes necessary <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful for the intervention by my noble friend lady carnegy of lour <e> <s> i reiterate that the government have no plans

advance warning of the amendment <e> <s> i hope that he has now received a reply <e> <s> the important point is that there is nothing between us in principle <e> <s> as my noble friend pointed out we

of schedule as a whole <e> <s> this is couched in the terms of a regulation-making power and the government have made clear that before deciding to make such regulations they will discuss with the

lords a review of the conditions under which staff occupy accommodation is at present being undertaken by the national health service management board <e> <s> that review is now at an advanced stage and the boards proposals are being considered in the light of the housing bill one of the purposes of which is to increase the amount of private sector accommodation available for rent <e> <s> furthermore a mortgage package has been introduced by the nationwide anglia building society <e> <s> the aim of the scheme is to provide low cost per cent <e> <s> mortgages to help national health staff cope with high housing costs in london <e>", "<cs> my lords i am unaware of that great store of hot potatoes <e> <s> i can assure the noble earl that if one looks at last years figures for nurses leaving the national health service which might be a good point at which to start one sees that there were leavers whereas newly-qualified staff entered the service <e> <s> however what is more important some nurses returned to nursing thus giving a net total of some staff going into the health service <e>", "<cs> my lords we live in a free country <e> <s> furthermore last year there were nurses who asked for their qualifications to be verified overseas but wished to be qualified in this country from the community <e> <s> i wonder whether the question that the noble lord has asked is being asked in the countries of those who wish to come to work in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords there can be no better sign of faith than the commitment that the government have made to nurses pay <e> <s> i must remind the house that the administration that preceded this administration reduced their pay by per cent <e> <s> in real terms <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the point made by my noble friend lord auckland because i had hoped to point out in an earlier answer that to a great extent there is a two-way traffic in this affair <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only repeat what i said earlier <e> <s> my right honourable friend has declined to see the staff side again on the basis that the government have fully funded the award of some per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a privilege to answer a question from the noble baroness but i feel that it is slightly wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> if she would like to put down a question on that point i should be more than happy to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of what the noble countess is saying <e> <s> pay is not the only point <e> <s> one of the keys of the clinical regrading is to increase career prospects for nurses in the clinical wards <e> <s> management pay and prospects are the three great things needed to make for an even better national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that it is fair to say that after the pay award has been completed there will be a different point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only say that we now have a record number of nurses in the health service <e>", "<cs> my lords we know of hospices in the united kingdom providing in-patient care for people with a terminal illness <e> <s> included in this number are the london lighthouse and the mildmay mission hospital which provide residential care for people with aids only <e> <s> a further hospices have indicated a willingness to care for people with aids <e> <s> at present there are some hospice projects planning in-patient units for the terminally ill <e>", "<cs> my lords there are national health service hospices and i would assume if my counting is correct that there are therefore independent hospices <e>", "<cs> my lords in the case of hospices which receive funding from the area health authorities the level of financial support varies from nothing to per cent <e> <s> however the average commitment is per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a fact that the modern hospice movement is only years old <e> <s> on the basis of how much it has grown in the past years and assuming that the present rate of growth will continue i hope that all of us in this house will be most happy to see the future expansion of a very valuable movement <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot give the noble lord an accurate date for that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord is well aware of our health circular hc/ a copy of which is available in the library of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would like to ask me the question i shall answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all of your lordships will remember the autumn statement last week <e> <s> i should like to draw noble lords attention to the fact that we have recently announced a further million for health authorities in england for this year to meet the additional costs incurred by hospices and other charitable hospitals <e>", "<cs> my lords in my earlier reply i said to the noble lord that i was unable to give him a date at the present time <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no evidence to suggest that nursing auxiliaries are being used inappropriately or asked to undertake tasks for which they are not properly trained <e>", "<cs> my lords as i am sure all members of your lordships house are aware there has just been a record pay deal for the nurses <e> <s> as regards auxiliary nurses their pay has increased by between per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> in the most recent settlement <e> <s> that is above the average for both the public and the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that i can go beyond my second answer to the noble lord lord peston which was that we believe there is no evidence to suggest that nursing auxiliaries are being used inappropriately <e>", "<cs> my lords i was unaware of that position of the noble countess but i assure your lordships that i would have had the utmost confidence had i been in her hands <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a more than interesting debate this afternoon on the bill <e> <s> however before i comment on the various points made by your lordships perhaps it would be helpful if i were to reiterate the three key objectives of the bill <e> <s> first it will enable the present rate support grants system to be closed down in an orderly manner without it we should be still calculating grant entitlements under the present system well into the s <e> <s> secondly the bill will provide local authorities with certainty about their grant entitlement for and for earlier years <e> <s> thirdly it will remove the incentive for authorities to indulge in creative accounting <e> <s> i know that the noble lord lord mcintosh was rather dismissive about that but i shall return to the matter later <e>", "<cs> my lords such a reduction is purely hypothetical and would have been unprecedented in local government finance <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that we shall have to agree to differ on that point <e> <s> the noble lord lord mcintosh drew your lordships attention to superannuation <e> <s> it has been suggested that those authorities which did not reflect their reduced employers superannuation contributions in the expenditure information returned to the department should now be allowed to make that adjustment and thereby gain grant advantage <e> <s> but local authorities are requested to revalue their superannuation funds every five years <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mcintosh is i believe referring to what i described in my speech as the alternative rules <e> <s> i felt that i covered that point in my speech but i shall repeat the basis <e> <s> the alternative rules would require the submission of new information and that would not enable us therefore to bring an early close to the present rate support grant system <e> <s> authorities with increased spending would be reluctant to submit further information because by doing so they would make themselves worse off <e> <s> the alternative rules are complicated they do not produce clear unambiguous figures for each authority and they would present considerable operational difficulties <e> <s> i feel that these alternative rules will be a recipe for confusion <e> <s> i hope that i have answered the question which the noble lord felt had not been answered <e>", "<cs> my lords in a second i am hoping very much to come to the points which the noble lord raised earlier <e> <s> i shall go on to the points concerning cardiff <e> <s> perhaps i may once again say how grateful i was for the letter that i received from the noble lord <e> <s> of course there will be disappointment on the part of authorities such as cardiff <e> <s> i fully understand their position <e> <s> on the other hand other authorities have benefited although they have naturally been rather more reticent in announcing this <e> <s> one of the key objectives of the closedown proposals was to arrive at a set of simple rules equally applicable to all authorities <e> <s> i regard a clean break on th july with no exceptions as the mot equitable and straightforward way of achieving that objective <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that that answers the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only add that at closedown on th july no authority had made even its unaudited outturn expenditure return to the department <e> <s> even if we had waited until st august there would still have been fewer than such returns with the department <e> <s> one of them was audited <e> <s> i feel that i cannot go further than what i have said this afternoon <e> <s> i commend the bill to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i commend the bill to your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords strong working links have been established between officials in the three departments <e> <s> they have worked together and will continue to do so on the resettlement of hospital patients into the community and encouraging co-operation between local agencies <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to confess that the noble countess has the advantage over me as regards paragraph <e> <s> however i assure her that there has been frequent collaboration between the three departments on housing health social services and social security issues relating to community care <e> <s> within the last months there have been a very substantial number of issues discussed on a tripartite basis <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord ennals will be well aware the department of health actively has the griffiths report under consideration <e> <s> as to his point about housing the department of the environment has asked local authorities to concentrate their resources for housing on those who need it most such as the disabled the elderly and people on low incomes <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord carter has drawn to your lordships attention the department has received the letter and is considering its response <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in reply to a question a fortnight ago the department is considering the report at this moment and although i cannot give a date a response will not be too long <e>", "<cs> my lords according to the latest figures the level of local authority spending on personal social services of which this is obviously a component is billion per annum <e> <s> i believe i am right in saying that the level of expenditure on personal social services between and rose by some per cent <e> <s> in real terms <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been and will be an increasing amount of money available <e> <s> local authorities will have to make decisions within the broader context on which areas they wish to spend money <e> <s> i cannot on behalf of the local authorities answer the question of the noble countess <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do adjourn during pleasure for five minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords the nature conservancy council expects to submit a report on its review of national nature reserves by the end of the year <e> <s> it will be a report to the government <e> <s> the results of the review will be announced in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall certainly consult interested parties before any final decisions are taken <e> <s> with regard to the finance that the government have put into the nature conservancy council i think that it is very important to put the matter in perspective <e> <s> in the amount of money which the government placed was some million and next year it will be in excess of million <e> <s> that is an increase of per cent <e> <s> in real terms after inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords an increase of per cent <e> <s> in real terms after inflation is a very substantial increase over a decade <e> <s> i am not avoiding the question <e> <s> we shall increase expenditure next year and we have increased it enormously in the past decade <e>", "<cs> my lords i have at no point denied that expenditure next year will increase from million to just over million <e> <s> i have reminded the noble baroness of the very important fact that expenditure in real terms over those years has risen by per cent <e> <s> and have put the matter into perspective <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lord lord taylor i should hope very much that my first supplementary reply which indicated that we shall consult all interested parties before final decisions are taken would include forestry interests <e>", "<cs> my lords i draw the attention of the house to the fact that of national nature reserves only are owned outright by the nature conservancy council <e> <s> the remainder are for the most part owned by private individuals <e>", "<cs> my lords the review will consider whether any of the reserves owned by the nature conservancy council could be transferred to private owners or voluntary bodies <e> <s> however it is very important to remember that the proviso would be that there were adequate safeguards for conservation in those circumstances <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i shall have to write to the noble lord on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly not the intention of the department to prevent any further increase in the number of national nature reserves <e> <s> in fact one has been created every two weeks since we started <e> <s> at the moment there is only a temporary hold on new nature reserves <e> <s> in exceptional circumstances that could be overruled as well if there were important circumstances which required the immediate implementation of such a nature reserve <e>", "<cs> my lords as my right honourable friend the secretary of state for health has made clear on a number of occasions discussions on this matter are now at an end <e>", "<cs> my lords a new clinical grading structure has been agreed between the management <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord molloy earlier mentioned cohse <e> <s> i must point out that ministers are not prepared to meet representatives of those trades unions whose members are taking part in industrial action over the current regrading exercise while such action continues <e>", "<cs> the noble lord asks a number of variations on the appeals theme <e> <s> i shall try to answer simply <e> <s> we believe that there are considerably more appeals than there should be because a large number of nurses have been encouraged by their trades unions to place appeals regardless <e> <s> however we are trying to speed up the process by an arrangement of sifting so that those appeals that clearly concern a case of misadministration can be dealt with quickly and on a priority basis <e>", "<cs> my lords my initial reply to the noble lord lord dean is to say what a very good question <e> <s> one of the difficulties that has haunted this problem for the past few months is that quite rightly people possibly have a higher opinion of their own ability than others might judge <e> <s> i will be the first to admit to suffering from that sensation myself <e>", "<cs> my lords i am unaware of such a statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i can reply to the noble lord by pointing out that an unprecedented level of increase which equates in real terms after inflation to some per cent <e> <s> has been the commitment of the government to the nurses and to the health service <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to draw the noble countesss attention to my earlier answer in which i said that a sifting process has been introduced in order to treat genuine inequality where it has taken place as soon as possible <e> <s> this is part of the process which is now under way <e>", "<cs> my lords section of the control of pollution act gives local authorities power to specify the way construction work including maintenance must be carried out to minimise noise <e> <s> a notice may be served either before work commences or after it has begun specifying the type of equipment to be used or not used the hours of operations and the permitted level of noise <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i am correct in saying that since the introduction of mufflers on pneumatic drills the noise has been reduced <e> <s> as regards the nuisance value the best figure i have is for the number of prosecutions <e> <s> i am afraid that it refers to prosecutions on construction sites which does not necessarily specifically refer to prosecutions with regard to pneumatic drills <e> <s> last year there were prosecutions of which were successful and the average fine was <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble countess for drawing to my attention the conditon of white finger of which i was previously unaware <e> <s> i would refer her to my first answer but i point out that local authorities allow certain operations to be carried out at night for example where there is a burst water main which requires instant attention <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for the noble lords point <e> <s> in my lowly position i am hardly able to co-ordinate public services <e> <s> however i should also point out that one great difficulty about pneumatic drills is that by their nature they tend to be transient <e>", "<cs> this may be a suitable moment to break for dinner <e> <s> i suggest that is a convenient time to resume and i hope that this meets with the approval of the committee <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords the deregulation of reading glasses has no implications for the composition of the general optical council <e> <s> the council continues to be responsible for the promoting of the high standards of professional education and conduct among opticians in the interests of the public <e>", "<cs> my lords the general optical council does in fact include six lay appointees of the privy council to ensure that consumer opinion as well as optical medical opinions are available to the council <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that i shall have to write to the noble baroness on that point because i do not have the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly pass on the comments of the noble lord lord peston <e> <s> however judging by the way in which he just spoke one would slightly feel that no deregulation was about to take place <e> <s> i think that i ought to remind your lordships house that deregulation is about to take place <e>", "<cs> my lords my technical ability is somewhat limited with regard to autorefractors <e> <s> however <e> <s> i shall draw the noble viscounts comments to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am afraid that i shall have to draw that matter to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to have been able to present the regulations <e> <s> i am pleased too that both the noble lord lord underhill and the noble lord lord tordoff although they feel that the regulations have arrived rather later in the day than they would have hoped are nevertheless glad to see them <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord caithness i beg to introduce a bill to control the admission of spectators at designated football matches in england and wales by means of a national membership scheme and licences to admit spectators and to provide for the making by courts and the enforcement by designated agencies of orders imposing restrictions on persons convicted of certain offences for the purpose of preventing violence or disorder at or in connection with designated football matches played outside england and wales <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords the local provision of family planning services like other health provision is for individual health authorities to decide <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very much aware of the concerns of the family planning association about the closure of family planning clinics <e> <s> however i understand that proposals for the closure of clinics and reductions in services are not being taken forward in the form originally proposed once they have been fully debated and discussed locally <e> <s> i think it is significant that no closures have been so contentious that the full consultation process involving referral to ministers has been brought into play to date <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord lord hatch will find that the statute says <e>", "<cs> my lords i have indicated that the department of health has made clear that it expects health authorities to make full use of their family planning services <e> <s> i again draw the attention of the noble lord lord ennals to the point i made concerning my second answer to my noble friend lord renton <e> <s> as to the increase in abortions i have to say that we cannot state that the closure of family planning clinics has a direct effect on the abortion rate because there is no basis on which the detail of the reasons for the increase in the abortion rate could be satisfactorily compiled <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the question of the noble lord lord henderson of brompton concerning the three research projects which are going on at the moment i believe i am correct in saying that the results will be available at the end of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble countess is aware that there is a certain level of disagreement concerning the cost effectiveness of the two alternatives certainly as concerns the department <e> <s> i must once again draw her attention to my earlier remark which is that a great number of the closures which were proposed have not in many cases taken place after further consultation <e>", "<cs> my lords the social services inspectorate is in discussion with the london boroughs of bexley and lewisham specifically about their responses to the spokes report <e>", "<cs> my lords as part of its joint work with the health advisory service a visit focused on services for mentally ill people is currently taking place in bexley and a similar exercise is planned for lewisham later this year <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is referring to disciplinary action with regard to the london borough of bexley two members of staff criticised in the spokes report have both left the authority <e> <s> with regard to lewisham the case worker criticised in the report no longer works for the authority <e>", "<cs> my lords we are very conscious of public feeling that our response should not be too long delayed with regard to the griffiths report <e> <s> we hope to put forward our own proposals in the near and i emphasise the word near future <e>", "<cs> my lords i do and we are <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the specific recommendations of the report we have provided an additional million in the present financial year towards a balanced programme of improvements to training <e>", "<cs> my lords as i am sure the noble baroness is well aware my right honourable friend the secretary of state keeps all matters concerned with health under review <e>", "<cs> my lords first let me humbly say how much i appreciated the speech of the noble lord lord butterfield more than that how illuminating i found it <e> <s> also i agree with what he said about there being no magic wand <e> <s> this evening has demonstrated that he is entirely correct in that supposition <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may suggest that this is a suitable moment at which to break for dinner and that we resume at eight oclock <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for health <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords possibly predictably the noble lord lord ennals accused this government of reducing expenditure and not supervising the beneficial development of the national health service <e> <s> before answering any questions i should like to remind your lordships house that expenditure since this government took office on the national health service has risen in real terms after inflation by some per cent <e> <s> none of us should forget that fact <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i should like to thank my noble friend for his very kind remarks and to answer the three points which he raised <e> <s> with regard to the per cent <e> <s> remuneration for gps the noble lord said that that may not have gone far enough <e> <s> my answer to him is that we have gone quite a long way <e>", "<cs> my lords finally i shall certainly draw to the attention of my noble friends who are in charge of such matters the desire for a debate at the earliest opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that the hospitals will be no freer at all to leave the national health service <e> <s> i must emphasise the important point about the governments proposals for allowing hospitals to become self-governing <e> <s> they will become self-governing as national health service trusts <e> <s> they will be part of the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that my noble friend is somewhat pre-empting the matter with his assumption that a date for the debate has already <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for my noble friends comments <e> <s> i am sure he is aware after having heard the statement that the review has concentrated on hospitals and family doctors in particular <e> <s> i am certainly well aware of the importance of medical research and will draw his remarks to the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords research is covered in the white paper review on pages and <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend lord rippon for raising that point <e> <s> i should point out to him that he will see in the white paper a very important statement namely that the object of the programme that we are proposing whereby we shall be reducing the numbers involved on boards is to reduce membership to people who have in part a straightforward technical contribution to make <e> <s> there are other people who will not be on the board such as contractors and those who might <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his question <e> <s> he is entirely correct in stating that on paper some hospitals could fit the profile but i think it is true to say that we in the department are certainly not expecting hospitals to be in national health service trusts right away or probably ever <e> <s> the key is to provide a shining example which will be to the advantage of every hospital up and down the kingdom and which will result in standards not only being equal but improving <e>", "<cs> my lords that is certainly not the case <e> <s> i can assure your lordships that responses to the secretary of states letter of st november to the regional health authority chairmen on your <e>", "<cs> my lords first perhaps i may sincerely thank the noble earl lord halsbury for his very kind words <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls will be disappointed but i fear it is not proper for me to comment on the decisions which judges have made in individual cases <e>", "<cs> my lords all interested parties are concerned in the discussions which are taking place <e>", "<cs> my lords first i thank the noble lord lord winstanley for his kind remarks <e> <s> in answer to the last part of his question the discussion document will be published in the next one or two weeks <e> <s> part of the problem of the very fast rise in cost of the insurance premiums is that they reflect not the claims which are taking place today but the claims which might take place in future years <e> <s> that is why the percentage rise which has been very severe does not reflect a disastrous state of affairs which has occurred or is occurring but the possibility that one may occur <e>", "<cs> my lords the subject of no-fault insurance has been discussed before in your lordships house and one often hears of the examples of sweden and new zealand <e> <s> however i must draw your lordships attention to the fact that sweden has a very different social security system which provides a different starting point <e> <s> if one looks at the case of sweden one sees that the average payout on the no-fault liability is only but that is because of their social security system which is very different from that in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully appreciate the point made by my noble friend lord nugent and i shall certainly draw it to the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords as always i am most interested in questions from the noble lord lord paget <e> <s> however it is fair to say that his question is slightly wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that there is a grain of truth in the point made by my noble friend lord morris <e>", "<cs> my lords the very first time i replied to an unstarred question in your lordships house was in regard to the national health service <e> <s> as i rose on that occasion all my notes fell to the floor <e> <s> your lordships house was very forgiving as noble lords received a very confused reply to an unstarred question from a very confused younger man <e>", "<cs> my lords the number of hoped for improvements are quite substantial <e> <s> that is why i confined my original answer <e> <s> however i assure my noble friend lady strange that there will be something called the guaranteed standards scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that that question is rather wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords again i feel that that question is wide of the question on the order paper which specifically refers to services and the rights of consumers after privatisation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hatch will be aware that sadly i was unable to be here to listen to his speech yesterday but i hope that i can provide a satisfactory answer <e> <s> the bill will provide a new and strengthened legal basis for drinking water quality standards <e> <s> under the bill regulations will reflect the requirements of the european community drinking water directive and a general duty on all water undertakers to supply only water which is wholesome will be enforced by the secretary of state <e> <s> moreover it will become a criminal offence to supply water that is unfit for human consumption <e>", "<cs> my lords i give an example to the noble lord lord ezra of where i hope the consumer will be better off <e> <s> the existing consumer consultative committees are appointed by the water authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord mcintosh for his kind words <e> <s> in answer to the first part of his question i will be more than happy to reply to his noble friend lord strabolgi if he puts down a question concerning price <e> <s> the question on the order paper clearly refers to the services received and the protection thereafter <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i think it is fair to say that we have had a long and interesting debate <e> <s> i should like to congratulate all noble lords who have spoken on their valuable contributions and if i may say so their forbearance <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord caithness recognised that significant measures had been taken by the government the police and football authorities to deal with football hooliganism <e> <s> unfortunately many of those measures to which noble lords have paid tribute had to be pushed through reluctant football authorities by the governments persistence <e> <s> we face the same barriers again now <e> <s> the link between football and hooliganism is still with us <e> <s> more action is needed to break that link and once again it is the government who are taking the lead <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will let me finish the paragraph i may be able to answer him <e> <s> there is no question of the government seeking to bulldoze through an ineffective scheme on an unrealistic timetable <e> <s> some noble lords have raised the possibility of some form of phasing in of the introduction of the scheme i know that this is the position of my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls suggesting that it should be introduced on a pilot basis initially in only the first and second divisions or to those clubs which attract attendances over a certain level <e> <s> i should say that it was the football league members and the minister for sports working party which reviewed the main principles of the scheme last summer who felt most strongly that phasing would mean that hooligans banned from clubs in the scheme would simply attend matches at <e>", "<cs> the practicality of the situation is that everyone effectively on the list of known troublemakers would have to be called in for example to a police station and the mechanism could be intolerable to implement <e> <s> the bill will stop those individuals who have a restriction order made against them from travelling to key matches abroad <e> <s> equally it will show other countries that we mean business and we have the resolve to act <e>", "<cs> my lords i was trying to draw the houses attention to the fact that a number of noble lords referred to the luton town figures as being down by a third <e> <s> i have to bring noble lords attention to the most recent seasons figures which are of great interest <e>", "<cs> my lords the logic of the governments position is that we are not intending to introduce the scheme in scotland though as the noble lord lord harris of greenwich is aware should the situation get out of hand in scotland i think i am right in saying this my right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland has said that it might be considered there <e>", "<cs> my lords i am unaware whether this is the same system as that at london airport but i do not think it is <e> <s> the noble lord lord knights asked whether it was appropriate for the offence of entering or trying to enter a ground without a membership card to be a criminal offence when the scheme itself will be run by a civilian body in the form of the fma <e> <s> my answer is that we must provide an effective deterrent to those who might ignore the membership scheme <e> <s> if we leave it to the clubs to take civil action the deterrent will only be a limited one and there is a risk that large numbers of hooligans will turn up without membership cards <e>", "<cs> my lords that would not be the case <e> <s> if unfortunately he was the kind of fellow who would go and cause an affray he would be arrested with his passport and be seen as someone who was undesirable to enter a football ground <e> <s> if he tried to present his passport again someone might well ask a question <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that if the noble lord reads the speech of my honourable friend the minister of state he will find an answer to his questions <e>", "<cs> my lords the question on the order paper asks whether the government have any plans <e> <s> i am hoping and endeavouring to answer that question <e> <s> we have

reverend prelates question of course i am replying on behalf of the department and these are questions which as he himself rightly pointed out are questions that church leaders in bradford are

not but they have a different view from that expressed by opposition members on how to achieve a better form of local government and a better delivery of services to the community and we most

noble friends remarks <e> <s> i assure him that with my best endeavour i shall draw anything that he says to the attention of those to whom i have access <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to the last part of my noble friends question i do not think i am in a position to make any little bits illegal but i am afraid that i have some rather disappointing news in relation to returnable charges <e> <s> i believe that in south australia they have proved to be very effective <e> <s> but when the same experiment was conducted in oregon in the united states the reverse experience occurred and the depositing of litter increased <e>", "<cs> my lords we have doubled the grant and the purpose of doubling the grant is to try to find initiatives for a cure <e> <s> i am sure that all noble lords in this house are well aware that there is litter everywhere <e> <s> it is very difficult to try just to enforce the laws <e> <s> there are already many laws <e> <s> the programme for the tbg involves projects grouped in order to try to find answers and initiatives to teach people particularly the young not to acquire the habit of throwing down litter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble and learned friend for his intervention <e> <s> it is true that recycling is a growing industry and is showing results <e> <s> there is the save-a-can scheme run by the can makers association to enable the recycling of cans as well as bottles so that they do not litter the countryside or the streets of our country <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully appreciate the noble lords point <e> <s> we are doing our best to educate the public <e> <s> the difficulty is that litter is proliferating over a vast area particularly in the countryside and it is difficult to enforce the law <e> <s> the long-term answer is to teach people that it is environmentally unacceptable to drop litter <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand my noble friends point and i shall draw it to the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of the disappearance of such litter bins but i shall endeavour to discover more about them <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that westminster city council has a programme of sponsored litter bins in line with the scheme pointed out by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the driver of a combine harvester will

confused as to whether the noble lord lord dean is suggesting that mr brooke should be paid less than his legal and contractual entitlement <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> these amendments seek to make mandatory the phased introduction of the membership scheme <e>", "<cs> they would make it a requirement on the football membership authority to investigate and report to the secretary of state on ways of achieving this <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> would provide that as part of this process the football membership authority would have to examine basing the phased introduction of the scheme on the criteria of ground capacity present club membership and average attendance at home games over the past three seasons <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> makes trials mandatory <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> would require the football membership authority to look at the desirability and feasibility of implementing the scheme in the football league in four stages beginning with division one clubs and ending with division four clubs <e> <s> this would have to be done before the provisions in part i of the bill could take effect <e> <s> indeed as they are drafted they would appear to make no provision for part i of the bill ever to come into effect <e>", "<cs> i am not referring to statistics <e> <s> i am referring to what i and many millions of other people saw on television news last night <e> <s> fighting broke out soon after the train left manchester victoria station <e> <s> the train was extensively damaged and the british transport police have set up an inquiry <e> <s> the argument that the third and fourth divisions of the football league are unaffected by hooliganism simply does not stand up <e> <s> if the national membership scheme had been in place anyone who may be convicted following those incidents would lose his or her membership and be unable to attend future matches <e> <s> the scheme is relevant to incidents of this kind <e>", "<cs> i believe that what i have just said is not rubbish <e> <s> i invite the committee to reject the amendment <e>", "<cs> with regard to the question of names of members of the working party it was composed of the organisations who after all are the important parties representing the clubs and various other interested parties <e> <s> these included the football association the football league the association of chief police officers and the central computer and telecommunications agency <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment seeks to exclude wales from the requirements of part i of the bill <e> <s> it would mean that matches played at the grounds of the three welsh clubs which play in the football league cardiff city swansea and wrexham would not be subject to the requirements of the national membership scheme <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord graham is well aware that it is an absolute cornerstone of the bill that the clubs must be included <e>", "<cs> because the governments advice was that the way to tackle the problem was to try to tackle it with the four divisions and the three welsh clubs are part of the four divisions <e> <s> were we to do otherwise we would start interfering with the fundamental basis of the advice that the government received on this matter <e> <s> that is why i am unable to concede to the noble lords lord graham and lord brooks the commitment that they would like me to give <e>", "<cs> as i said earlier the government were advised by the ministers working party <e> <s> as i am sure the noble lord lord harris is aware we continually have discussions both with the league and with the association but the key feature is that we should have an odd situation if three clubs in the league are not parties to the scheme <e>", "<cs> in answer to the noble lord lord cledwyn as i stated earlier the secretary of state has a working party <e> <s> the problem is slightly more complicated than wales itself because the three clubs we are talking about cardiff swansea and wrexham are playing in a transnational league <e> <s> this is where the real difficulty arises <e> <s> we are not talking about three clubs playing in the glorious and beautiful isolation of wales but three clubs who are playing in a transnational league whereby they are exposed to the activities of the other clubs <e> <s> because of that it makes the situation very difficult to remove those three from a transnational league <e> <s> i can give no commitment but i can take it away for consultation <e>", "<cs> these amendments are designed to limit the application of the scheme to certain matches <e> <s> i would like to make clear the governments general position on the principle of excluding certain matches from the scheme <e> <s> it is our intention that the scheme should apply to all matches between the football league clubs and to include other matches as the secretary of state considers it necessary to designate <e> <s> it is important in the interest of preserving the integrity of the scheme that it should apply to all the clubs in the football league <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord harris of greenwich feels strongly about the fact that the figures for arrest in the third and fourth division are low <e> <s> we should keep very much at the forefront of our minds that that is achieved with very high and heavy levels of policing <e> <s> that cannot lightly be cast aside <e> <s> it is important that we remember that two of these amendments could well hybridise the bill <e>", "<cs> the amendment seeks to restrict the power of the secretary of state to designate the football matches to which the requirements of the membership scheme must apply <e> <s> it would remove from him the ability to apply the scheme to any matches other than those played in a league or domestic cup competition <e> <s> however it appears that it would leave him free to designate a match in any domestic league or cup competition not just those organised by the football league or football association <e> <s> i suspect that that last effect was not intended <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord harris presents a seductive argument of why this is already rather superfluous but i must answer him in this way <e> <s> the object of the bill is to create a successful scheme <e> <s> there always was and there always will be a problem with any scheme to improve the state of hooliganism in english soccer when it comes into contact with any outside body <e> <s> one of those bodies could be a scottish football supporter coming to an england scotland game or a german supporter at the moment it could not be the latter but one hopes that in the not too distant future it might be a german supporter coming to see an englandwest germany game <e> <s> we understand that there are problems <e> <s> that is what i tried to explain in what we are hoping will be the outcome <e> <s> but it is very important that the football membership authority is able to address the problem in what it thinks is the most sensible way of dealing with it <e>", "<cs> i did not say that the question was hypothetical i only said that my answer would be <e> <s> after three and a half hours of debate in the committee this is the first time that i have mentioned the fma in all truth <e> <s> it is an occasion on which it is suitable to mention the fma because one of the main intentions of the bill is that the scheme will be supervised by and for football <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord lord harris has raised a point which must be discussed and that the conclusion will be achieved by that route <e>", "<cs> as i said at the very start of this debate there will always be a problem when an interface occurs with an outside source <e> <s> the government take the view that if we exempted certain grounds i take wembley as an example from part i of the bill they would act as a honeypot for hooligan bees <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord graham accuses the government of acting like a steamroller but he has only to think of what happened earlier this afternoon to find that that is not entirely the case <e>", "<cs> i have listened with interest to the noble lords lord stoddart and lord mishcon <e> <s> i do not think my position entitles me to direct new legislation with regard to the abolition of ticket touts desirable or not as that may be <e> <s> we have always been aware that there would be difficulties when people countries or groups who were outside of the scheme were coming into the scheme <e> <s> wembley stadium are <e>", "<cs> at the end of the day i believe there will be a satisfactory and amicable agreement on this because everyone at this moment wants an agreement <e> <s> the point that i am trying to make is that we really do not think that we can have an open season at wembley <e>", "<cs> these amendments seek to exclude from the scheme matches at those clubs operating a community football scheme <e> <s> the proposed new clause tells us what the noble lords have in mind as <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say two things briefly <e> <s> there is a real difference of view between the government and the noble lord lord graham about the principle of universality <e> <s> the noble lord also referred to the lack of flexibility by the government <e> <s> i draw his attention to the fact that we have reached only amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> as i explained earlier we do not believe that amendment no <e> <s> presents a workable proposition <e> <s> it would mean that the secretary of state in designating matches would need to satisfy himself that one or both clubs had not had a substantial hooligan problem for the previous three years <e>", "<cs> the bill as drafted provides for the secretary of state to designate those football matches to which the national membership scheme and the licensing requirements of the bill would apply <e> <s> designation would be by statutory instrument subject to the negative resolution procedure <e>", "<cs> it is important that we should make any attempt to enter a ground for a designated match an offence <e> <s> by doing so we introduce a powerful deterrent against those refused membership or whose membership has been revoked who might otherwise attempt to gain entry to a designated match for example by using a stolen or borrowed card <e> <s> i must emphasise to the committee that by this provision we have no wish to catch the genuinely innocent spectator who unknowningly attempts to enter a ground without a membership card in circumstances where one is necessary <e>", "<cs> i did not hear what the noble lord lord carter said <e> <s> was the hoarding inside or outside the ground <e>", "<cs> i assume that they will not be committing an offence if they are on hoardings outside the ground <e>", "<cs> the clause applies to two classes of people <e> <s> it applies to those who are liable to be members of the scheme <e> <s> but the law will see it in a different light with regard to age because the law is different for various ages regarding certain offences <e>", "<cs> clearly someone standing outside a football ground is not attempting to gain entry to that football ground <e>", "<cs> i disagree with the noble lord <e> <s> the age of criminal responsibility is <e> <s> this is not the first offence ever to appear on the statute book <e> <s> there are plenty of other examples of where people can attempt to commit a crime <e> <s> imprisonment is the maximum sentence and not the standard sentence <e>", "<cs> there are two parts to that question <e> <s> the noble lord lord harris and other noble lords referred to someone arriving a foreigner or a resident at the turnstile and asked whether they would be committing an offence <e> <s> that is not the case <e> <s> i outlined in the reply i gave to the committee that the person arriving at the gate particularly in the example given by the noble lord lord harris which would be relevant might be a foreigner who was not aware of the law in this country <e> <s> he might arrive at the turnstile and be asked where is your card <e> <s> to which he replies i do not have a card at which point the gatekeeper says you cannot enter the ground <e> <s> that foreigner has in no way committed an offence but if he then tried to assault the gatekeeper to get into the ground <e>", "<cs> i shall deal first with the offence of attempting to commit an offence <e> <s> this only arises when someone tries to get into a ground without being authorised to do so <e> <s> if that person is told that he cannot get in without a card and he accepts that advice he commits no offence <e> <s> the offence arises if he tries to get in deliberately without a card <e>", "<cs> between the ages of and one has to have guilty knowledge <e> <s> but the one-month sentence is the ultimate sentence <e>", "<cs> one cannot go to prison under the age of as the noble lord lord harris of greenwich will be well aware <e> <s> a fine would presumably be imposed on people under <e> <s> that fine is clearly defined in the bill as <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord is well aware the minimum age for a custodial sentence is <e> <s> there will of course be a difference between how the law applies to those who are under the age of and how it applies to those above the age of <e> <s> it will obviously apply more severely to those over the age of <e>", "<cs> i have to take issue about this bill suddenly arriving in your lordships house <e> <s> this bill is the result of years of building frustration in the general public about the problems of soccer <e>", "<cs> under the age of of course it is not custodial <e>", "<cs> i am sorry under the age of <e> <s> under the age of it cannot be custodial in any shape or form <e> <s> the alternative to that is a fine not exceeding level <e>", "<cs> for the sake of absolute clarity i should like to be able to write to the noble lord lord harris on this point <e>", "<cs> we have reached a slightly confused situation by dealing with amendment no <e> <s> as well <e> <s> we have considered carefully whether imprisonment should be available as a penalty in the event of offences relating to unauthorised attendances at designated matches <e> <s> it will not be used in all cases <e> <s> that will be for the courts to decide <e> <s> we have concluded that there must be an effective deterrent sufficient to deter professional hooligans hooligans who may have been banned from the scheme already perhaps for violent behaviour and to whom a fine is not a sufficient deterrent <e> <s> we cannot forget the fact that the bill is designed to protect the innocent <e> <s> if we are to protect the innocent there must be a deterrent for the guilty <e>", "<cs> the clear fact of the matter is that there is a system of law in this country and we do not intend to interfere with that <e> <s> we are simply trying to introduce a deterrent with regard to this bill <e> <s> the fact that a person under the age of will not be imprisoned is a fact of the law of this land <e>", "<cs> i was under the impression that amendment no <e> <s> was in the next group <e>", "<cs> the bill refers to the administrator who will draw up the scheme submit it to the secretary of state for approval and run it <e> <s> administrator is a neutral word <e> <s> it does not mean that we have a secret plan to appoint a civil servant to run the scheme or that we are planning to keep the football authorities out of the scheme <e> <s> it is simply a means of referring to the body who will administrate the scheme <e> <s> we all know that the words used in legislation and in everyday speech are not always the same <e>", "<cs> by its very nature the situation with the league and the fa is fluid <e> <s> the government clearly must have a target and i am well aware of the arthur young letters to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> the purpose of the present discussions is to see how quickly the scheme can be implemented <e> <s> the overriding feature to which the noble lord referred is the workability of the scheme <e> <s> as he knows from debates earlier today we are very much committed to the scheme working in order for it to be implemented <e> <s> i wish i could give the noble lord the precision that he requires but at the moment i cannot do so in quite the way that he wants it <e>", "<cs> the matter to which the noble lord refers is the subject of a later amendment <e>", "<cs> i think i can be positive on that <e>", "<cs> this amendment introduces a new concept that of requiring the fa and the football league to consult the representatives of football supporters in nominating members to the fma <e> <s> for the reasons which i have given i do not think we need to go into the question of the detailed composition of the fma at this stage or make decisions on how many members it should have <e> <s> however i have sympathy with what i take to be the spirit of the noble lords amendment that football supporters representatives should be involved in the preparation of the national membership scheme and in the running of the fma <e> <s> the football authorities are now working on the preparation of the scheme <e> <s> i very much hope that they will consult both the football supporters association and the national federation of football supporters clubs in the process <e> <s> my honourable friend the minister for sport met both parties just before christmas to discuss the governments proposals <e> <s> i venture to suggest that the football authorities should do no less <e> <s> in the circumstances i hope that the noble lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the amendments provide for consultation with the football authorities if the fma as administrator is to be removed when the scheme is drawn up and when it is modified <e> <s> i have already said that the government accept completely the need for the football authorities to be consulted about any proposed national membership scheme and that i am happy to consider amending the bill to spell out that point <e> <s> we need to look at how the amendments might be made in the context of the administrator of the scheme being known as the <e>", "<cs> my lords when the survey is complete we believe that the report will indicate that there will be savings of some per annum initially and subject to various capital investments a potential saving of some but that very much depends on various other changes that will have to be made which may or may not be acceptable <e> <s> until we have the final report that expectation is slightly speculative <e>", "<cs> my lords the survey will be very widespread <e> <s> i shall certainly convey the noble baronesss information concerning the type of bulb to the relevant authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the difficulties about the palace of westminster is its unique shape and design <e> <s> there are problems in that unlike an ordinary building the engineers have to warm it up in anticipation and <e>", "<cs> for example at the state opening of parliament by having a substantial number of people in the building and it is a particularly cold day when the engineers have anticipated slightly warmer weather the result would be a complaint either about over-heating or about being too cool <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the money has been redirected <e>", "<cs> my lords i am unaware of the draught but i shall endeavour to investigate it <e>", "<cs> my lords the original campaign was most successful and the money has been redirected to the regions <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the governments commitment to the arts is proved by the fact that we have moved to a three-year funding arrangement the result of which will be that by arts spending will be per cent <e> <s> higher than it was in <e> <s> the government are committed to the arts and i do not believe that better proof than those figures can be produced <e>", "<cs> my lords the national heritage memorial fund was created in to protect our heritage <e> <s> the total public spending to date has been <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a great need at every level in society to encourage aesthetic awareness and i welcome the initiatives taken by my noble friend as the chairman of the royal fine art commission and through the art and architecture education trust <e> <s> i shall bring this important matter to the attention of my right honourable friend the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords the review committees task is to advise on the heritage pre-eminence as the noble baroness pointed out and its object is to recommend a deferral at a fair market price <e> <s> in most cases that is the recent sale price <e> <s> in the case of the turner to which the noble baroness referred the expert adviser and the committee were satisfied that million was an achievable price were the picture to be offered for sale now <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the question of the noble lord lord annan i am sure that he would not expect me to speculate but i shall certainly bring his remarks to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the national heritage memorial fund has put proposals to the dean and chapter of hereford cathedral <e> <s> the dean is grateful for those proposals and is considering them before making any public response <e>", "<cs> my lords i am of course interested in my noble friends remarks <e> <s> i take note of them <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lord lord armstrong perhaps i may point out that since the governments grant to support the victoria and albert museum has increased by per cent <e> <s> in real terms <e> <s> i believe that the increased expenditures which have taken place and which are proposed are part of the commitment we show towards the arts and the culture of this nation <e>", "<cs> my lords most supplies already comply with the provisions of the ec drinking water directive others will be brought into compliance before privatisation <e> <s> programmes will be agreed before privatisation for bringing the remaining supplies into compliance and the privatised water companies will be under a statutory obligation to fulfill those programmes by definite dates <e>", "<cs> my lords it would not be appropriate to answer one part of the question because the noble lord lord molloy has a question down for tomorrow which concerns pricing and the statutory water authorities <e> <s> that part of the question is not concerned with todays question on the order paper and it would therefore be right if i answered that point tomorrow <e> <s> as regards the standards that the ec and the consumer require at a future date there may be changes in those standards at some point the consumer is going to pay for the quality he requires <e> <s> to achieve quality attracts costs <e>", "<cs> my lords we have been discussing several aspects of the water bill with the commission and that will come as no surprise to the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> we have managed to allay its concerns as regards the implementation of the ec environmental directives but with one exception <e> <s> that concerns the legal provision of clause b protecting water companies from enforcement or prosecution action for breaching the ec drinking water directive so long as they have agreed an improvement programme with the department <e> <s> we are discussing this aspect of the bill with the commission <e>", "<cs> my lords my department will establish a team of inspectors to ensure that water undertakers are complying with the standards <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that the proposed water bill does not interfere with the activities of water diviners but i am not sure whether the ec has any plans <e> <s> i shall write to the noble lord to confirm or deny that position <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord lord hatch is aware that for five years the british government proceeded on a basis without <e>", "<cs> my lords the first debate to which i replied in your lordships house was a debate initiated by the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> not surprisingly it concerned the national health service <e> <s> i remember that on that day there were many eminent noble lords in your lordships house and i <e>", "<cs> my lords it may come as a surprise to the noble lord lord bruce but the road to damascus has not yet been crossed by me <e> <s> i was interested that <e>", "<cs> and that intention is the preservation of the national health service and the improvement of that service <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the minister for water and planning has made it clear that he sees no justification for water <e>", "<cs> my lords because he feels as the noble lord lord molloy pointed out that we should be looking at phased increases <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the future pricing of water by the statutory water companies of course there will be factor k it is clear that the value of k will be drawn up on the basis of the financial standing of the company and its future financial profile <e> <s> where that shows surplus funds built up through charges increases not related to needs but purely for the purpose of swelling reserves the value of k will be lower than it otherwise would have been <e> <s> therefore the reduction of the charges will increase in future years allowing customers the benefit of those surpluses <e> <s> that means that there will be no advantage to the statutory water companies if they do that for other than good reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always slightly confused by the attempt to relate privatisation to environmental demand <e> <s> i and the government believe that the consumer is willing to pay for quality and that cost has nothing to do with privatisation <e>", "<cs> my lords the shareholders will depend upon a satisfied consumer <e>", "<cs> my lords it is too early to comment on individual cases <e> <s> a number of companies may face increased costs in making a start towards meeting the drinking water directive and in drawing up their asset management plans in preparation for the new regulatory regime <e> <s> both those areas will benefit the consumer <e> <s> some may have thought that large increases this year will give them a higher charging base when the new charging regime starts <e> <s> people individuals and groups probably find it easier to blame the government than anything else <e>", "<cs> my lords when i referred to the consumer earlier i was referring to the fact that the consumer demands quality <e> <s> we were discussing the implication whereby privatisation is confused with the demands of the consumer for environmental benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have made clear to the advisers of the water companies association that while the present statutory controls remain in force water companies must continue to abide by them <e> <s> that guidance did not invite the water companies to exploit those limits to the full in advance of the regulation under the water bill nor did it indicate that failure to do so would put them at a disadvantage under the new regime <e>", "<cs> my lords as a result of privatisation standards will improve <e> <s> i should remind your lordships house that this is not the first time that there have been high increases in water costs <e> <s> water authority rates rose by more than per cent <e> <s> in and by per cent <e> <s> in the following year <e>", "<cs> my lords the difficulty starts with the fact that when there was a dog licence which cost only p over half the dogs in the united kingdom were not registered <e> <s> the government are ready to consider whether there is any scope for improvement to the large amount of legislation which already exists on dog welfare and control <e> <s> however any changes must be effective and enforceable and cannot be introduced as an emotional safety valve <e>", "<cs> my lords at present there is no evidence that the number of stray dogs is increasing <e> <s> according to the published reports of the rspca the number of dogs which the society puts down each year has been roughly constant at to per annum during the s <e> <s> it is hard to see where the reported figure of dogs per day or what would be per annum originates from <e>", "<cs> my lords i received much fortitude from the remarks made by my noble and learned friend and also from the support of his canine friend <e>", "<cs> my lords first i must with the strongest words reject the insinuation of the noble lord lord graham that i do not take the matter seriously <e> <s> the very great difficulty of which everyone in this house is aware is that originally when there was a dog licence over half the dogs in the country that is nearly million dogs were not registered and did not have a licence <e>", "<cs> my lords if half of the dog owners in the country did not pay the licence fee when it was p i suspect that the percentage would be even smaller were the fee to be <e>", "<cs> my lords of course there is considerable cost involved <e> <s> however we return again to the problem of enforceability that is really the crux of the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to enforceability one of the great problems which would be the first to arrive on the doorstep would be that the number of dogs thrown out of their homes dumped by the roadside and so on would possibly be very great indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to confirm the noble lords point about dog collars <e>", "<cs> my lords the london residuary body and the county hall development group exchanged contracts for the sale of county hall complex on th january this year <e> <s> the county hall development group jointly with the london residuary body submitted a number of applications for planning permission listed building consent and conservation

council chamber and the concert hall and to remove the post-war additions to reinstate sir ralph scotts original design <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend will approve of that proposal <e>", "<cs>

will receive the money which it handles on behalf of the ratepayers of london <e>", "<cs> my lords in the long term if the building in the middle of the roundabout is removed the roundabout will

noble and learned lord lord brightman has done the position the government have taken on the matter <e> <s> i would not even attempt to do so <e> <s> i welcome the fact that my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls understands that this is done with the best of intentions <e>", "<cs> this is the first in a series of amendments dealing with the possibility of exemptions to the national membership

them <e> <s> before i do so however let me say at once that it is my intention to accept amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord lord northfield if he felt that i had not covered the question of wembley stadium <e> <s> i am very grateful to the noble lord lord graham because the reason why i did not cover the issue of wembley stadium was that i did not want all the amendments to be grouped together <e> <s> that would have been the effect if i had tried to respond to all the amendrnents which will be dealt with later this evening in committee <e> <s> i did not respond to the noble lord lord northfield at that stage because i felt that the issue was dealt with under amendment no <e> <s> and we might finish up debating all of the amendments in a rather loose and unorganised way within the first amendment <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord harris and the noble lord lord northfield will understand the reason <e>", "<cs> i could reply to amendment no <e> <s> now but we are in danger of getting ourselves into a difficult position and losing control of the order of events <e>", "<cs> this amendment makes it a mandatory requirement for the scheme to provide that sponsors or the representatives of sponsors of sporting events or their directly or indirectly invited guests for whose behaviour the sponsors would be responsible should be exempted from the scheme <e> <s> i hope that i made clear the governments position on exemption during our discussions on the previous amendment tabled by the noble lords <e> <s> we certainly accept that the scheme must provide for exemptions and we have demonstrated that by accepting amendment no <e> <s> of the noble lord <e> <s> i have offered to consider spelling out on the face of the bill certain categories of exemption the registered disabled in designated areas of the ground being one <e> <s> the exemption arrangements for these categories must be tightly drawn <e> <s> many noble lords will share our concern that exemptions should not be so wide that they present the hooligan with an open invitation to beat the system <e>", "<cs> i believe that as an officer of the club the noble lord lord mellish would be excluded <e> <s> i must first make one point very clear that we are not suggesting for one moment that there would be endless riotous assembly in respect of executive boxes <e> <s> the position of the government is quite straightforward that the scheme will become more and more complicated with more and more exemptions <e> <s> we are not trying to suggest that there is something worryingly wrong with executive boxes <e> <s> far from it <e> <s> i must make that clear <e> <s> the noble lord was right in his assumption <e> <s> the proposal is that the temporary membership scheme should apply and the <e>", "<cs> the amendment would mean that each club would be required to provide a room where club directors officers or others concerned with the management of the ground or organisation of the match or their directly or indirectly invited guests would be able to attend designated matches by producing a ticket for the room from which they would view the match but from which the general public was denied entry <e> <s> the person inviting the guests would be responsible for the guests behaviour <e>", "<cs> the answer to that is that that is certainly possible but of course the controlling factor on that will be the convenience of the club involved <e> <s> it is impossible for the government to give a categoric assurance on that but it is technically possible and i am sure that it will be possible in the event <e>", "<cs> i assume that the noble lord lord harris refers particularly to whether or not there is a limit on numbers <e> <s> the reason i referred earlier to <e>", "<cs> first i give an assurance to the committee and particularly the noble lord lord harris of greenwich that i accept entirely that we must provide reasonable notice of government amendments at report stage <e> <s> i am happy to give that assurance <e>", "<cs> i have explained the governments general position on exemptions <e> <s> while we accept that there should be mandatory provision for exemptions in the scheme i have undertaken to consider placing specific categories of exempted spectators on the face of the bill i have also explained our concern to ensure that whatever exemption arrangements are made under the scheme they should be tightly drawn <e> <s> i know that many members of the committee share our concern that exemptions must not be allowed to become a series of loopholes in the scheme and open invitations for people to beat the system <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may answer the small but important point raised by the noble lord lord harris of greenwich <e> <s> he asked about records <e> <s> the police do not have records concerning the relationship between conviction and season ticket holders <e> <s> i accept the point entirely in exactly the same way as i pointed out to the committee our view regarding sponsors and executive boxes <e> <s> we are not worried about sponsors boxes and executive boxes <e> <s> i am sure that no one is worried about the season ticket holders <e> <s> it is the principle of making the scheme work and having everyone within the scheme that concerns us <e> <s> that is why we believe that it is impracticable to exempt as this amendment hopes to do all those who are holding a season ticket and have held one for a year preceding <e> <s> i personally have nothing but admiration for the season ticket holders who support their clubs <e> <s> however it is a fact as the noble lord lord graham has pointed out that in certain clubs they represent per cent <e> <s> of the gate <e> <s> it is a huge block to exempt <e>", "<cs> that is the information which i have <e> <s> and tremendous value for money that represents <e> <s> the noble lord lord harris drew attention to the fact that like some early post-war junior minister i referred to loopholes <e> <s> all i can say is that this amendment will not be a loophole it will be leaving the farmyard gate open <e>", "<cs> it is rare that i have ever been known to say anything categoric but i can assure the committtee that the secretary of state has no intention of running football <e> <s> the government would love to exempt season ticket holders <e> <s> they are probably best described as the backbone of the game <e> <s> however those in the working party who considered the scheme said that if we exempt season ticket holders we are removing such a large proportion of the people that we might as well not have the scheme <e> <s> if one takes the position which the government do that the country wishes to have a scheme and to do something about football hooliganism the scheme must have universality <e>", "<cs> i have explained the governments general position on exemptions <e> <s> we accept that there should be mandatory provisions in the scheme <e> <s> we shall consider putting specific categories of exempted spectators on the face of the bill <e> <s> it is essential however that these should be strictly limited as i have said before because of the danger of wide-ranging exemptions and also because in this case there is a possibility of confusion and chaos at the turnstiles <e>", "<cs> the proposers of the amendment have presented an attractive argument which slightly misrepresents the governments position <e> <s> perhaps i might explain their argument in this way quite rightly pensioners are a special group of people in this country and because of that the result of the bill is in some way an imposition upon them <e> <s> that is neither the case nor the position from which the bill started out <e>", "<cs> i draw the committees attention to the second reading debate in which many speeches were made concerning the confusion and complication of entering a ground with just one card <e>", "<cs> of course i do not have any evidence because we are talking about the future when the scheme comes into play rather than the current state of affairs <e> <s> it would be under a new regime <e>", "<cs> again those are seductive arguments from my noble friend lord onslow <e> <s> however a case is being made that denies the existence of the problem and why we have the scheme <e> <s> there is a complete difference of opinion <e> <s> we believe that the scheme and the membership of the scheme is a protection and not an inhibition <e>", "<cs> protection is provided very simply on this basis <e> <s> the purpose of the bill is to introduce a scheme that will rid the game of hooliganism <e> <s> that by definition will protect those who are members of the scheme <e>", "<cs> i must answer that <e> <s> i have conceded everyone has conceded from the very start that no one was saying that any old age pensioner had been or ever was seen rioting <e> <s> on the principle of protection the noble lord lord harris may not like it the objective of the scheme is to reduce hooliganism <e> <s> we believe that the best protection lies within the context of the scheme <e> <s> that is why we feel that it is a benefit and not a disadvantage as it is being portrayed <e>", "<cs> amendments nos <e> <s> and d will provide mandatory exemption for people registered disabled under the disabled persons employment act and will extend the exemptions to people registered under the chronically sick and disabled persons act who are registered blind and who are in receipt of mobility or attendance allowances <e>", "<cs> in replying at this late hour to amendments nos <e> <s> and c i shall speak only briefly after the remarks of the noble earl lord onslow concerning men over <e>", "<cs> i would go even further than the noble lord lord harris of greenwich and say that the basis of the governments argument would be there if none had occurred <e>", "<cs> i am not aware whether my right honourable friend the prime minister will be a member but if she is not a member she would attend on a guest card <e>", "<cs> if the prime minister were going to a football league club she would also attend on a guest card <e> <s> the simple fact of the matter is that i know and understand that noble lords opposite consider the bill to be among other things an imposition <e> <s> the position the government have always taken is to see it as a protection <e> <s> when we talk about women we who are after all the weaker sex in some ways have introduced a bill to protect people <e> <s> these are the very people whom we wish to protect <e> <s> our proposal is very straightforward <e> <s> we wish to bring in the scheme as we have been advised to do <e> <s> if it works i am sure that all noble lords will be very happy but the fact is that it is within the legitimate desires of the government to bring in the scheme as they have been advised <e> <s> that is what we are intending to do <e>", "<cs> i have just remembered that i failed to answer the point of the noble earl lord onslow concerning separate figures for female soccer violence convictions <e> <s> no such figures are kept <e>", "<cs> the very straightforward answer is that i do not have that information with me at this moment <e> <s> i shall write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i am glad to take this early opportunity today to restate the governments intentions in relation to exemptions from the national membership scheme <e> <s> in our debate last week i accepted the amendment moved by the noble lords lord graham lord harris and lord carter whose effect was that the scheme must make provision for exemptions of specified descriptions of persons on the terms and conditions specified in the scheme rather than that it may do so as the bill was first drafted <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene for a moment <e> <s> the noble lord lord graham is slightly confusing what i said <e> <s> we have the greatest admiration for luton <e> <s> what i said was that lutons scheme is not comparable or applicable to the scheme we are now discussing <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls <e> <s> we are not opposed to guests in principle <e> <s> it is how the guests achieve admittance to the ground which is the area of disagreement as my noble friend points out <e> <s> i am slightly curious as to whether or not the noble lord lord graham will be tabling an amendment at a later stage which will ban all away supporters at soccer matches <e> <s> he appears to accuse me of on the one hand not supporting luton and on the other saying that it is an admirable scheme <e>", "<cs> so long as the club is the issuer that is correct <e> <s> the point we desire is that the club should be responsible <e>", "<cs> that is not what i said <e> <s> i said that the club must take responsibility for the guest so the guest must be issued with day membership by the club <e>", "<cs> i am slightly confused about what the noble lord lord underhill says that i said because i do not think i said that <e>", "<cs> as regards previous information the computer system will have records on it because there has to be a comparison of information in order that people who are banned from the scheme and who are not members can be checked on the black list <e> <s> i believe that my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls expressed very clearly what i thought i was explaining <e> <s> perhaps i may make it absolutely clear <e> <s> the basis of the admission of guests is fine as long as the club accepts the responsibility <e>", "<cs> i would not wish the committee to suffer from a misapprehension here <e> <s> the noble lord lord graham has not drawn our attention to an important proviso that is very straightforward <e> <s> i have consistently said that the club will have to accept responsibility <e> <s> that responsibility carries with it penalties if certain matters go wrong <e> <s> i do not want the insinuation to go out to the committee that a club can happily issue or guest tickets <e> <s> i do not believe that any club will issue guest tickets with quite the free abandon that the noble lord lord graham is indicating because of the responsibilities attached to each of the guest passes <e>", "<cs> the guest card will not have a photograph on it <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord harris is absolutely correct <e>", "<cs> i believe that we have covered the issue of exemptions very thoroughly <e> <s> i have explained that the government see membership of the national scheme not as a burden but as a benefit <e> <s> those who are presently members of individual club schemes will certainly appreciate this <e> <s> they have joined their clubs scheme because of the benefit it offers <e> <s> they will wish to join the national membership scheme for the same reason <e> <s> the government accept that there are good grounds for certain groups to be exempt from the scheme <e> <s> we have listened to the arguments the committee has advanced and i hope noble lords will agree that our response on exemptions has been more than reasonable <e> <s> we have undertaken to deal effectively with the needs of a number of groups the committee has suggested should be exempted <e>", "<cs> we discussed this amendment in committee last tuesday <e> <s> i explained then the governments general position on exemptions and why we do not believe that there are good grounds for exempting women from the scheme <e> <s> the central premise stands repeating <e> <s> we want as many law-abiding spectators as possible to join the scheme and enjoy the benefits of membership <e>", "<cs> for the simple reason that the purpose of the scheme is to exclude hooliganism <e> <s> that is the threat <e>", "<cs> i have always tried to emphasise that our purpose in resisting the amendment as we have in other areas for example in relation to old age pensioners is to ensure the schemes integrity <e> <s> we resist the amendment for that and no other reason <e>", "<cs> i am interested in what my noble friend says <e> <s> his proposition which i understand but with which i disagree is that all groups which are clearly not a threat to the scheme should be excluded <e> <s> all the advice given to the government was and is that if we are to attempt to introduce a scheme it must have universality <e> <s> it is for that reason only that we resist the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may answer the noble lord lord mellish before turning to the point raised by the noble lord lord harris <e> <s> the committee to which i was referring was the minister for sports advisory committee we feel strongly that the success of the scheme depends on it being universal <e> <s> i quite understand that the noble lord lord mellish does not agree but that is what we believe <e> <s> it is the basis on which we are proceeding <e>", "<cs> i am just coming to the point the noble lord lord harris has made <e> <s> with regard to the impression of the acpo to which he referred it is that the number of arrests among women at football matches is low <e> <s> i shall repeat that it is the answer i suspect the noble lord wanted <e>", "<cs> the arguments of the noble lord lord mishcon are as always very seductive <e> <s> but the objective of the bill is to reduce violence <e> <s> we believe that it will do so and that because of the membership scheme we shall increase the number of ladies going to football matches <e>", "<cs> i quite understand the approach of the noble lord lord harris but in terms of achieving a reduction of violence at football grounds the primary means will be through the scheme <e> <s> a welcome additional improvement will be the presence of ladies at football matches <e> <s> however in order to make football user-friendly for want of a better phrase we must exclude hooligans <e> <s> that is the object of the legislation that is what we are trying to achieve <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may return to the very early part of the debate on the amendment when the noble lord lord stoddart quoted me saying that i used the words relatively simple <e> <s> i used the word relatively advisedly <e> <s> it is relatively simple but not that simple <e> <s> part of the difficulty about all groups of exemptions glossed over by the noble lord lord stoddart if i may say so in summarising the debate is that at second reading in your lordships house a tremendous amount of time was given to the problems caused by any scheme where hold-ups occurred because alternative forms of identification had to be used <e> <s> that is a fact we cannot get away from <e> <s> it is one of the reasons why we are resisting the amendment on grounds of practicality <e>", "<cs> these amendments are concerned with the discretion which the fma would have to withhold or withdraw membership from the people who misbehave at football matches but who have not necessarily been convicted of a criminal offence <e> <s> the question of the treatment of convicted hooligans is the subject of clause of the bill on which we have other amendments to consider <e>", "<cs> to answer the noble lords question i need to return to the current situation namely that all clubs have the right to exclude anyone whom they consider to be a menace <e> <s> the noble lord says that we know that but it is important in the context of what follows otherwise it is as if we are to impose a scheme that does not already exist <e> <s> at the moment there is no right of appeal or opportunity to give ones side of the story but under the new proposals we are essentially trying to codify what already exists and put it on a universal basis so that it can be effective against persistent hooligans <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the situation that we are discussing does not involve the judicial process <e> <s> we are essentially codifying the rights that the clubs already have <e> <s> that is why i believe that the matter does not quite fit the criteria described by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord harris is correct <e> <s> it would normally be a matter of hearsay evidence and the police pointing out misbehaviour would then lead to a club official seeing it for himself <e> <s> the police officer would therefore draw it to the attention of the club official and as a result it would have to be the club official who acted on it <e> <s> as the noble lord lord harris pointed out the police officer would not be involved in any subsequent action because the club official would himself have had to see the evidence <e>", "<cs> it would be very dangerous and foolish of me to rule that never ever would the police be asked to give evidence <e> <s> however the point that the noble lord lord harris made is correct <e> <s> if the club official did not appear he is entirely right the club official would not be able to present evidence <e>", "<cs> i explained when we were discussing the noble lords previous amendments that the government regard the operation of the fmas discretion to disqualify people from membership as a crucial aspect of the national membership scheme <e> <s> i have told the committee that i entirely accept that there must be rules and criteria by which the fma should exercise its discretionary powers <e> <s> clearly it is important that anyone who is disqualified from membership by the authority should have the right to make representations against its decision <e>", "<cs> i need not rehearse the governments position on exemptions <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble lord lord harris will be grateful <e> <s> members of the committee will be clear about that <e> <s> it is a central premise of the scheme that everyone of whatever nationality and wherever they live who intends to visit football league matches on a regular basis should join the scheme <e> <s> this principle certainly extends to member states of the european community <e>", "<cs> in my opening reply to the noble lord lord harris i pointed out that it is the intention that those who regularly attend a club for example manchester united or manchester city regardless of whether they are english or foreign nationals should have a regular membership rather than try to use the temporary membership scheme <e>", "<cs> if a foreign passport holder acquires a guest membership card which was issued in good faith by the club and then commits an offence the club will have the defence of saying that it issued the card in good faith <e> <s> however the fact of the matter is that the clubs will not wish to issue endless repetitive temporary membership cards because it will be troublesome for them to do so <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble lord lord harris will not be surprised if i say that in my present position i cannot speak on behalf of the football league or the fooball association <e>", "<cs> at the start of this debate the noble lord lord harris of greenwich drew our attention to paragraph of the report on which the fa and the league were represented <e> <s> i may have expressed myself badly with regard to the individual attending a soccer match in the united kingdom in good faith <e> <s> if the club gives a temporary membership card in good faith and the individual subsequently commits an offence the clubs defence which is entirely reasonable is that it gave the card in good faith <e>", "<cs> we are proposing that the fma and the clubs will agree this among themselves <e>", "<cs> as i said earlier i do not speak for either of those bodies <e> <s> we propose and they will be able to read this debate that the fma which will be run by the fa and the league as i pointed out earlier this afternoon will want to happen that which the noble lord lord graham wants namely that football will be run by football <e> <s> that is a problem which is perfectly suited to them to sort out <e>", "<cs> at the start of this debate i repeated to the noble lord lord harris of greenwich with the greatest respect paragraph of the ministers working party on which the football authorities were represented <e>", "<cs> i am slightly confused by the noble lord <e> <s> one reason that the government have resisted so many exemptions is in order to prevent the scheme being too bureaucratic <e> <s> on the other hand <e>", "<cs> this amendment prescribes the details to be carried on the national membership scheme card <e> <s> it limits these to the owners name and address club affiliation date of issue of the card and the date and place of the previous match attended <e> <s> i have listened carefully to the arguments advanced by the noble lord lord graham <e> <s> i fully understand his concern at the prospect of the membership card carrying details of its holders attendance at past matches and the possibility of cards being programmed with other information unbeknown to the holder <e> <s> i share that concern <e> <s> in our view the information contained on the card should be the minimum necessary to ensure that the membership scheme is effective <e> <s> i accept that there is no need for a record of attendance to be maintained on the membership card <e> <s> all that is necessary is that the system provides for the latest use to be recorded so that the card cannot be passed to an unauthorised user for re-use at the same match <e>", "<cs> the effect of this amendment would be to remove any significant distinction <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord graham of edmonton pointed out these amendments seek to involve local authorities in the running of the scheme by giving them licensing functions under the bill <e> <s> i am not clear from the drafting of amendment no <e> <s> a whether the licensing authority mentioned is meant to be the same authority as that dealt with by clauses to of the bill or a new separate authority which would have an additional role in checking the performance of the clubs under the scheme <e>", "<cs> if the prediction of the noble lord lord northfield is correct the scheme will have been an unparalleled success <e> <s> to answer the concerns of the noble lord lord dean we shall deal with the question of the licence when we come to amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> there is so far in this debate a fundamental difference in point of view <e> <s> members on the benches opposite feel that a devolved system of licensing is peferable to the point of view that the government have held that we should have a central system <e> <s> i spoke entirely in good faith in what i said concerning local authorities if they want to come to the department and wish to specify some centralised system that might be of interest <e> <s> however that does not change the governments position with regard to a developed system <e> <s> that is the point <e> <s> that is the main fundamental disagreement that exists between our two sides today <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord harris is entirely correct to draw our attention to the final part of the explanatory memorandum which clearly sets out that that might be the outcome <e> <s> however i feel that i have gone some way towards meeting the aims of the noble lord lord graham of edmonton <e>", "<cs> i have said that <e> <s> i go even further <e>", "<cs> if the association of district councils or the ama wish to run the licensing authority i will listen to any proposal they make <e> <s> i cannot make a commitment but i shall listen if they want to run a responsible national body <e>", "<cs> i said it just now <e>", "<cs> several minutes ago tens of minutes ago i said that i would listen to the local authorities <e>", "<cs> i must intervene <e> <s> that is not what i said at any point this evening <e> <s> i said that local authorities would be operating on a devolved basis <e> <s> i said that in my opening remarks <e> <s> that is very different <e>", "<cs> as placed in the bill this amendment would require that if the scheme made provision for the payment of reasonable fees in connection with appeals from decisions taken at the discetion of the fma to withhold or withdraw membership of the scheme the assessment of what was reasonable would have to be based solely on the circumstances of the appellant <e> <s> in effect it would require the personal circumstances of every appellant to be investigated and established before the fee for his or her appeal could be determined <e>", "<cs> the government have considerable sympathy with both this amendment and the next <e> <s> my noble friend lord caithness confirmed in his second reading speech that it is our intention that members of the scheme should have the full protection of the data protection act in terms of access to information held about them and in relation to the use to which such information is put <e> <s> if a member does not want his name and address to be disclosed to a third party for example for the purposes of a commercial mailing list it is certainly our intention that he should be able to make this clear <e> <s> a box on the application form of the kind envisaged in this amendment would be one means of achieving this protection <e>", "<cs> this amendment has two effects the first to determine that a membership card is the property of its holder the second to stipulate that a card can be inspected only when the holder wishes to obtain entry to a match <e> <s> the minister for sports <e>", "<cs> i should very much like to read what the noble lord lord harris of greenwich said on the matter so that i may consider the points he made <e>", "<cs> i said inside the ground i did not mention outside the ground <e>", "<cs> if it has evidence of a criminal offence the fma like any private individual or body should present it to the police <e> <s> the police will then report the person for summons if they consider that appropriate but the conduct of the proceedings will be taken over by the independent crown prosecution service <e> <s> there is nothing to prevent the fma from taking a private prosecution <e> <s> the normal procedure would be as i have outlined <e> <s> however i should like to study further what the noble lord lord harris said <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord graham pointed out the amendment proposed would replace most of clause with a significantly weaker provision <e> <s> clause concerns the disqualification from membership of people who are convicted of relevant offences <e> <s> relevant offences are defined in the schedule to the bill to include offences which are committed at football matches and offences which are committed <e>", "<cs> this amendment and amendment no <e> <s> b which was not moved take us over ground we have covered in other proposed amendments to clause <e> <s> the clause as drafted provides that there should be two standard periods of disqualification from the scheme for convicted offenders <e> <s> the noble lord lord graham of edmonton is primarily concerned to have the answer to what the word standard means <e> <s> i had intended to say on amendment no <e> <s> b that i would be willing to consider the word standard and that if it was not considered the best that could be used i would hope to come back with more satisfactory terminology <e>", "<cs> what my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls has just said is what i was trying rather poorly to explain earlier <e>", "<cs> this amendment would mean that wembley stadium need not obtain a licence to admit spectators to designated matches played at wembley <e> <s> its effect would be to exclude international matches and cup finals from the national membership scheme <e> <s> this would run the risk that the stadium could become a focus for hooligans banned from other matches under the scheme <e> <s> i remind the committee that some international matches played at wembley can be a particular focus for trouble and call for huge police reinforcements to be deployed <e>", "<cs> the government have agreed that wembley is a special case <e> <s> so we cannot definitively pre-judge what the fma and wembley will arrive at as their recommendations to go to the secretary of state <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord will concede that part of the point <e>", "<cs> it may be helpful to the noble lord to say that we discussed the matter earlier this evening <e> <s> the civil service alternative to which he referred is the last option that the government would like to see <e> <s> we said earlier that the governments preference would be for the football membership authority to be the agency <e> <s> i also pointed out to the noble lord lord graham when we were discussing the amendment with regard to the local authorities being licensed that if the local authorities the ama or the adc wish to make a case for being the licensing authority we should certainly listen to them <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly read what the noble lord has said and quite possibly i shall be expecting a substantial amendment from him at report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would like to table a question on dispersal i should be more than happy to answer it <e> <s> however he is probably aware that the psa was criticised by the public accounts committee for having too much dependence on leasehold and not enough on freehold <e> <s> i should like to think that what the government have just done will contribute towards a better balance and answer the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords the simple fact of the matter is that there are a number of leaseholds held by the psa which are due for review shortly <e> <s> as a result it is thought prudent that in forward planning the psa should acquire a freehold for future definition and we hope accommodation of government departments <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the principle i outlined earlier concerning the pacs review of leasehold properties has answered the question put to me by the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey <e> <s> however if he would like to table a question concerning dispersal which i would quite understand i should be more than happy to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that i am entirely right in supporting what the noble lord lord hutchinson said <e> <s> it has nothing to do with development of the tate gallery <e>", "<cs> my lords i must refer the noble lord lord sefton back to my earlier reply <e> <s> we are looking at two different issues <e> <s> one is the issue he raised concerning dispersal of government departments to outside the capital and the other concerns the estate of the government <e> <s> the fact is that the government are being extremely prudent in reviewing the position concerning their leasehold properties and in regard to the balance of freehold properties <e> <s> on that basis if the noble lord would like to table a question concerning the dispersal of government departments i should be more than happy to answer it but it is a separate question from that on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the government agree that it is absolutely crucial that the larger developing countries should join the montreal protocol <e> <s> we appreciate the desire of such countries to develop and enjoy the benefits of refrigeration <e> <s> the london conference aimed to show that it will be possible to do so without using harmful cfcs <e> <s> at the conference brazil undertook to become a party while china the asian countries and the members of the gulf co-operation council said that they would also give it serious consideration <e> <s> the montreal protocol includes provisions to help developing countries <e> <s> the first meeting of the parties in helsinki will examine how to take these proposals forward <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will be aware from my previous answer the montreal protocol fully accepts that we must look after the interests of the less developed countries <e> <s> as all noble lords will know if everyone in china acquired a refrigerator the prospective emissions would be a large multiple of anything produced in the united kingdom <e> <s> one of the objects of the conference was to get an extraordinary number of people and countries together in order to address the problems and to find out what those countries felt should be done to assist them <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that it is possible to create ozone but there are some difficulties in getting up into the atmosphere to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the first thing the government did to help the developing countries was to call the conference and provide the initiative <e> <s> the second point that must be faced up to is that at the moment we do not have available direct swaps for cfcs <e> <s> we are looking for instance at technology transfers but these are early days yet <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the last part of the noble lords question i doubt whether that would ever be possible <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness will be aware that the object of the exercise from this countrys point of view is to eliminate eventually the production of cfcs <e> <s> notable companies are already engaged in a dialogue but we still have a long way to go <e>", "<cs> my lords that question i feel is just a little wide of the one on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords all domestic and commercial refrigerators and freezers currently <e>", "<cs> my lords officials from the department are in discussion with industry representatives about this difficult question <e> <s> the bulk of cfcs in refrigerators is in the insulating foam <e> <s> no techniques for its safe disposal have yet been developed <e> <s> the coolant however can be recovered and recycled in most cases <e> <s> that is happening widely in commercial refrigeration <e> <s> at least one retailer of domestic refrigerators has agreed to remove old applicances and extract the coolant for recycling <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not an expert on ammonia but i can assure the noble viscount that one of the features of the montreal protocol will be that the incentive for recycling will increase progressively with the reduction in production <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we are beginning to drift somewhat wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> however i can assure the noble lord that certainly with regard o future fire extinguishers all encouragement will be given for them not to be used in for example training <e> <s> moreover research is being carried out to see whether a replacement for those extinguishers can eventually be found <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two parts to the problem <e> <s> as i explained earlier the incentive for the recovery of refrigerants themselves will increase the difficulty is with the insulation to which there is no answer at present <e> <s> as a result there is a difficulty <e> <s> that is why we are pushing so hard to eliminate the production of cfcs because that is the fastest way of tackling the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most interested in what the noble lord the leader of the opposition said <e> <s> but as regards insulation which is half of the problem of cfcs my understanding is that there is no satisfactory way at present of dealing with that <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the question posed by the noble lord officials from the department will shortly be meeting representatives of local authorities to discuss their role in the efforts to reduce the emissions of cfcs <e>", "<cs> my lords in responding to this motion i like many other noble lords was very grateful to the noble lord lord mcintosh for pointing out to a certain extent the irony of debating this particular motion within your lordships house <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that i am in the difficult position of benefiting neither from patronage nor from the battlefield <e> <s> i suppose i fall somewhere in between <e>", "<cs> my lords i do apologise <e> <s> one can easily swap examples <e> <s> in addition to the number of significant individual bodies i can point to major reductions in the number of new town development corporations and as a result of the transfer of responsibility for industrial training bodies to the industries which have the main interest in their activities <e> <s> moreover a major result of the governments privatisation programme has been that some of the countrys largest industries and corporations have returned to the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall come to that point a little later if my noble friend will agree to that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most interested in the point just made by the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> indeed i quite understand what he is saying <e> <s> i find when i go around the country to address meetings that when i arrive people are uncertain about the issue of water <e> <s> interestingly by the time i leave they are not only much more certain but they are also much happier after they have heard what i have said <e> <s> i am not indicating to the noble lord lord ennals that what i said will in any way be a national earth shattering change but i do say to him is that when the issues are clearly understood a very different understanding is attached to them than that which he perceives in the polls which he mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords the difficulty about answering that question is that it is very much horses for courses because i am not quite sure to which groups or bodies the noble lord lord rippon is referring <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord ennals is aware there will in fact be an element of self-appointment with the hospital trusts if and when they come to be set up <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that he cannot be here but i was intending to answer his point in any event because it has a broader implication <e> <s> his point concerned what he referred to as the plc-ing of enfield council <e> <s> i think it is fair to say that that council is an elected authority <e> <s> it sees its job as being an attempt to be enablers <e> <s> of course members of the council will have to go before their electorate again <e> <s> however i do not think that that is the case with a plc <e> <s> the members were elected they will have a different view and they will have to present <e>", "<cs> my lords i referred to g-mex because in all previous discussions with the noble lord lord dean we have described it as such before going into the finer points <e> <s> we believe that the residuary body has been remarkably successful <e> <s> indeed the government support its efforts in getting on to finish the job <e> <s> as regards the questions posed by the noble lord lord dean of beswick concerning what will happen from hereon i can assure him on that specific point that the residuary body will be wound-up later this year and it will hand over the public sector interests in the manchester central station companies to the districts <e> <s> further the residuary body will have no role and it will be entirely for the districts to decide who sits on the board and who holds executive office <e> <s> i hope that that answer satisfies the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late point my best answer is to refer the noble lord to what i said in my statement on the health service white paper which clearly covers the point that he raised <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the last part of the question posed by the noble lord lord mulley i believe that my honourable friend the minister for sport actually refereed a game of football only the other day <e> <s> with regard to the governments position over the application for returning to europe for the forthcoming season we have always made it absolutely clear that until we see a factual improvement which we hope will come about with the introduction of the bill which is before your lordships house at present we shall not support such an application <e>", "<cs> my lords the simple fact is that the question concerns uefa which concerns europe <e> <s> the heysel stadium matter means a great deal in europe and must be dealt with <e> <s> that is why we are not supporting an application for re-admission to european competitions for this forthcoming season <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the answer to that question is simply no <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a pleasure to stand in the shadow of a great aficionado <e>", "<cs> my lords first the government have always recognised that great efforts have been made to curb hooliganism <e> <s> however it is our determination that we should return to international football as the country which is setting the example of how to battle against international hooliganism especially football hooliganism be it at home or abroad <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe is spreading his wings somewhat further than the question on the order paper <e> <s> i must remind him that this had nothing to do with the government <e> <s> the fact is that there was a disaster in belgium <e> <s> it is because of that disaster that english football clubs are not playing in europe <e> <s> further that is why the government are trying to do something to help england to be proud again so that this country may once more be able to raise its head in international football <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may remind the noble lord lord hatch of what i said earlier in answer to the question <e> <s> we wish to be in the forefront of an international campaign and that answers a part of the noble lords question <e> <s> again the noble lord failed to mention the heysel stadium <e> <s> as regards this question which relates to europe that means a great deal <e>", "<cs> my lords i would never attempt to be autocratic in your lordships house particularly when being asked a question by the noble lord lord mellish <e> <s> the noble lord is absolutely correct that the amendment has nothing to do with the european aspect of this matter <e> <s> as regards the other part of his question we shall be returning to that matter at the report stage of the bill in your lordships house next monday <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first remind the noble lord that i undertook without commitment to take away the amendment for consultation <e> <s> of course i referred to the meeting to which the noble lord referred in a letter that i have not seen <e>", "<cs> my lords i take great exception to that <e> <s> the noble lord lord graham is trying to put his own interpretation on the meaning of the word consultation <e> <s> i have already explained to the house what i meant <e> <s> my explanation did not suit <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am grateful to the noble lord for those remarks <e> <s> i was extremely conscious on the first day of the committee that this is a very welsh matter <e> <s> because of that i felt it <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments take us back to the important matter of how best to deal with international matches played at wembley as the noble lord lord graham pointed out at the beginning of his remarks <e> <s> it is an issue on which we have spent a considerable amount of time <e> <s> i have made it clear that the government regard wembley as a special case <e> <s> we entirely accept that special arrangements will be necessary to deal with foreign spectators at international matches <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to have this early opportunity to spell out the governments position on parliamentary approval in relation to the national membership scheme <e> <s> the bill already provides for the secretary of states designation of football matches to be subject to parliamentary approval but it does not at present do so in relation to the scheme itself <e> <s> however i am pleased to be able to make a positive response on that issue now <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has yet again misinterpreted what i said <e> <s> i gave him an indicative set of dates <e> <s> on any scheme or project one has to have a set of dates on which to work <e> <s> that is very different from what he implies i said <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to that question is quite straightforward <e> <s> there are many matters upon which the noble lord lord graham and myself disagree but there are however some upon which we have agreed <e> <s> one of those is that it has always been the governments intention to have football running football <e> <s> perhaps i may use lord grahams analogy of the top table <e> <s> we propose that there will be a top table at which the two hosts will be the fa and the football league <e> <s> if they feel that it will be an addition to the formation of the fma to have people representing various other bodies in football then it would be up to them to ask such people to become involved <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is better informed than i am on this matter <e> <s> i shall have to correspond with him <e> <s> i believe that i can now say that the answer is yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i am correct in stating that i said that earlier when speaking to the original amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i gave an example of this earlier this afternoon on a previous amendment <e> <s> it was where for instance the fma went into liquidation <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> my lords there is also the possibility that the football league and the fma might decide that they did not want to run the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mountevans has in part answered in the way that i should like to answer the noble lord lord harris <e> <s> we are well aware of the substantial number of scandinavian supporters who come to this country <e> <s> we do not understand why we should make an ec separation when considerable number of supporters as the noble lord lord graham will know both of arsenal and of tottenham hotspur come from scandinavia <e> <s> that is the reason for that <e>", "<cs> my lords it will be possible to get into a ground <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord lord hylton that his suggestion of introducing the figure of six matches would complicate matters even further <e>", "<cs> my lords as i am sure the noble lord lord harris is aware we see the temporary membership card as the way in <e> <s> confusion has arisen <e> <s> a foreigner going to see tottenham hotspur as an individual rather than as a member of a group would be able to identify himself most easily by producing his passport <e> <s> i should assume that the club secretary would regard the production of that passport as a valid reason for giving the foreigner a temporary membership card <e>", "<cs> my lords i am interested by the remarks of the noble lord lord stoddart <e> <s> in earlier stages of the bill and earlier this afternoon the opposition have considered it right and proper to introduce measures aimed at lower sentencing <e> <s> then the noble lord stands up and says that he is willing to engage in oppressive measures <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord stoddart has referred to just one amendment <e> <s> there were a number of other amendments at committee stage which would have reduced the level of sentence <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord said this is a paving amendment on the exemptions which will follow hereafter <e> <s> the grammatical change that it proposes will not be necessary if noble lords withdraw the subsequent amendments as i hope they will <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said previously when i spoke to amendment no <e> <s> we have tried again to provide here something which is helpful and useful <e> <s> the difficulty resides in where one pitches the age at five or years <e> <s> the age of has two advantages <e> <s> first it is the age of criminal responsibility secondly one will never obtain the perfect answer if there is to be an exclusion as i am sure the noble lord would agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that the noble earl is entirely correct on that matter <e> <s> i am sure that if we said that we would not exempt anyone down to the age of one he would consider that even less satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very interested in this <e> <s> it is extraordinary <e> <s> the government produce a concession that is based on common sense <e> <s> it is immediately jumped upon by the opposition as presenting insuperable problems <e>", "<cs> my lords we envisage that there will be special areas where accompanied children can go <e> <s> let us consider the facts of the matter <e> <s> we are trying to make a helpful and useful provision <e> <s> there are various other amendments providing for different ages <e> <s> we have thought hard about why we believe that is the right age <e> <s> i am more than happy to differ from the noble lords but that is the governments position <e> <s> we introduced it as a concession without even being asked for it as i pointed out earlier in your lordships house <e> <s> we felt that it was the the best common sense age <e> <s> there has to be an element of common sense in everything <e> <s> we believe that that is the best common sense age for allowing children to be able to attend with their parents at a football match <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i am sure that the bill can live with a grammatical error until third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of whether women should be exempt was debated at some length on two separate occasions during the committee stage of the bill <e> <s> on the second occasion the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon moved an amendment which has the same effect as that which we are considering today namely it seeks a statutory exemption from the scheme for women <e> <s> the house debated and considered this point very thoroughly in committee and reached a clear decision not to provide for such an exemption <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> romania <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment means we again return to how best to deal with foreign spectators at international matches <e> <s> i have explained the government position on this important subject at some length <e> <s> we accept that foreign spectators at international matches cannot be expected to join the scheme <e> <s> at the same time i have explained why we do not think that international matches can be excluded from it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is well aware that it will be up to the secretary of state when he sees the fmas proposals <e> <s> the noble lord describes my faith as touching <e> <s> it is not touching we just have a lot of faith in the ability of football to organise the fma <e>", "<cs> my lords the temporary membership arrangements to which the noble lord lord graham alluded and proposed in the government amendments to the bill provide an entirely appropriate way of dealing with organised school parties <e> <s> we recognise that many clubs wish to encourage properly-organised school parties to attend matches <e> <s> they will wish to organise the arrangements in advance with the schools concerned <e> <s> if they wish they may offer temporary membership cards free to the members of school parties <e> <s> that will be for the individual clubs concerned <e> <s> it is a sensible arrangement that will allow the clubs to ensure that school parties are properly organised <e> <s> a blanket exemption for such parties would raise unnecessary questions of identification and definition <e> <s> a school party is particularly well suited to the temporary membership arrangements because by definition it has to be organised in advance <e> <s> such an arrangement suits and fits very well into this scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lord lord bonham-carter i do not believe that it will make any difference <e> <s> the simplest parallel that i can give to the noble lord lord graham is the matter that was raised when we were dicussing at an earlier stage of this bill package tours coming in from overseas <e> <s> i believe that this situation is very similar <e> <s> the school authorities will write a letter to the club <e> <s> in the same way as the package-tour operator will supply a list of names the school will act very much in the way that the noble lord lord graham suggested before i rose to answer his question <e>", "<cs> i am sure that all noble lords derived varying amounts of pleasure from the description of the noble lord lord harris of mythical rioting pensioners <e> <s> however we must face the governments intention with regard to this amendment <e> <s> we believe that for the scheme to work it needs to work in totality <e> <s> we see it giving benefit to all who are members <e> <s> we do not see it as a scheme which will place onerous difficulties upon pensioners <e>", "<cs> my lords the assumption of the noble baroness is that the bill will have no effect <e> <s> we believe that the bill will have an effect <e> <s> that effect will be to substantially reduce soccer violence <e> <s> if that is substantially reduced the sports good name will be restored <e> <s> if one of the happy outcomes of the bill is that protection and the ease of attending a football match are greatly improved then most members of your lordships house should support the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords first it was not relevant <e> <s> secondly i should be amazed if there was a single pensioner <e> <s> we are talking about the effect of the violence on the weak in society but the existence of that violence appears to be denied on the other side of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i have accepted the principle that young children accompanied by an adult member of the scheme or otherwise authorised by the scheme should be exempt <e> <s> we introduced an amendment to this effect even though we had not previously promised to do so <e> <s> such an exemption <e>", "<cs> my lords we debated this group of amendments during committee stage <e> <s> i said then that the government regarded it as an essential element in the national membership scheme that the fma should have the power to disqualify at its discretion people who misbehave at football matches but who have not necessarily been convicted of a criminal offence <e> <s> i made the point that individual football clubs already have and exercise the right to ban people from their grounds <e> <s> but as things stand someone who is banned from one club is able simply to go to another and cause trouble there <e> <s> bans imposed by the fma at their discretion on evidence received from the clubs will apply throughout the league <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the issue of arranging for dealing with appeals including the membership of a tribunal or review body is one of those which we wish to discuss with the council on tribunals <e> <s> i take the noble lords point on the importance of the independent members but i hope he will not press me to say any more at this moment <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am not sure that i said exactly that i had promised on every point <e> <s> the noble lord would be well advised to read in the <e>", "<cs> my lords we discussed this amendment in some detail during committee <e> <s> the provisions in the schedule focus on the right of members of the scheme in the management and operation of the scheme and in having the fmas decision reviewed in cases where membership is withdrawn <e> <s> i said in committee that i have every sympathy with the sentiments which lie behind the noble lords proposals for members rights in the running of the scheme <e> <s> it will be for the fma and the clubs to run and monitor the operation of the scheme <e> <s> but they will wish to take fully into account the interests of members of the scheme <e> <s> it is in their own interest to do so <e> <s> consultation with members is vital to the success of the scheme but just as important is the need for the fma and the clubs to be free to settle the most appropriate way of taking account of members interests <e> <s> it would not be helpful to attempt to spell out detailed arrangements like those in the proposed schedule on the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i do not believe that i can go further than i have already gone <e> <s> we are looking closely at the matter <e> <s> i cannot say any more than i have said <e>", "<cs> my lords as usual the answer is yes and no <e> <s> the noble lord has moved a revised amendment taking account of points made in committee <e> <s> it provides for personal details to be included on a card <e> <s> it provides that those details should be limited to name address photograph national and club allegiance and date of issue and if necessary the date and place of the previous match attended <e> <s> it would appear not to preclude the inclusion of advertising material <e> <s> this amendment is an improvement on its predecessor <e> <s> but i am still not convinced that spelling out the form and content of the card in the bill is a sensible thing to do <e> <s> the fact that this amendment suggests to the house more categories of information to be included on the card <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not condemning it <e> <s> i was presenting to the noble lord lord irving the facts that have been presented to me <e> <s> although the scheme has been admired in many quarters the results have perhaps not been as impressive as the noble lord feels they may have been <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to give an assurance to the noble lord lord harris of greenwich that my own personal best endeavours will come to bear to satisfy his point concerning the change in the date of the third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord graham moved an amendment on this subject in committee <e> <s> he explained then that he wanted to ensure that the police or club stewards should not as a preventive measure be able to demand to see membership cards from people approaching a football ground <e> <s> i sympathised then with his intentions but was unhappy about the effect of the amendment which he proposed <e> <s> i am afraid that my reaction to this amendment is much the same <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two points here <e> <s> first the two different periods refer to a criminal offence which results in a conviction and imprisonment and to a criminal offence which does not result in imprisonment <e> <s> i believe that we shall deal with the second point raised by the noble baroness when we come to amendment no <e> <s> and i hope to be able to illuminate the matter for her then <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall come to part ii shortly <e> <s> the amendment would affect significantly the way in which the bill proposes to deal with people convicted of a relevant criminal offence <e> <s> the bill provides that if someone is convicted of an offence as listed in the schedule he should be disqualified automatically from membership of the scheme for five years if he is sentenced to a term of immediate imprisonment and for two years if any other sentence is imposed <e> <s> the court is required to notify the fma of the conviction and the fma will set the date on which the disqualification is to begin under the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords we are discussing the fundamental basis of the deterrent that we feel is right <e> <s> as i explained earlier and i shall repeat again it is very straight forward <e> <s> we are half-way between what the opposition amendment wants and what the football authorities wanted <e> <s> we believe that we have to have a firm deterrent <e> <s> we are talking about a deterrent which is based on people who have been convicted of a criminal offence <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to reply briefly <e> <s> i am slightly disturbed by the fact that the noble lord lord graham brushed aside the example of precedence which is a matter of great importance in the history of the laws of this country <e> <s> however because this is the last amendment that we shall discuss tonight i am willing to meet him half way <e> <s> we can move to five days but omit the word working <e> <s> i believe that that is a fair consideration between the two of us <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house it means five days <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord hatch will be aware from the previous occasion when i answered a question concerning water for the first five years averaging was accepted as being the method which would be used it was only then that the commission changed the method and required individual sampling <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is correct to say that the united kingdom has the highest rate of connection to water supplies of any country in the european community <e> <s> i shall certainly draw my noble friends remarks as regards compliance in other countries to the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have that information with me at present <e> <s> however i shall

directive <e> <s> perhaps i may draw to your lordships attention the fact that we wrote to the commission <e> <s> we expected to discuss the material that we sent it <e> <s> we find it extremely discourteous that it did not bother to come back to us before proceeding with a reasoned <e>", "<cs> my lords all potential costs will be included in the prospectuses <e>", "<cs> my lords the question asked by the noble lord lord monson begins to move rather away from the reasoned opinion <e>", "<cs> my lords as always my noble friend lord st john has placed his finger upon the core of the problem

about the quality of welsh water <e> <s> as a consumer of it i can say that i am extremely satisfied <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that the noble lord lord hatch may have slightly misunderstood what i said <e> <s> i tried to make it clear that for the first <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter for the european commission <e>", "<cs> my lords the estimates were based on an objective study by an independent firm of consultants <e> <s> it will come as no surprise to noble lords to know that the local authorities may take a different view but we believe that we should support the view of the

his mind at rest and say that there is absolutely nothing sinister as he felt there might be in the timing <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly the original figures that i mentioned confirm that the cost of collection of the community charge will be twice as much as the noble lord said <e> <s> with regard to the points put by his noble friend lord stallard to which <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i have answered that question already by saying that it will be twice the cost <e> <s> i remind your lordships house that of course there will be twice the number of people paying so it is not entirely illogical that the cost should double <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a fact with which i did not disagree when i said that there would be twice as many chargepayers <e> <s> i also noted that it is entirely logical that there will be twice as many forms to send out <e> <s> we have always accepted that the system would be more expensive <e> <s> however we happen to believe that it is fairer and therefore it is a price worth paying <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> together with the stipulations in amendment no <e> <s> to which it refers would have the effect first of preventing the nra from contracting any work out to a water or sewerage undertaker and secondly of putting local authorities in a privileged position as regards the letting of contracts for any work it did decide to contract out <e> <s> the first three subsections of amendment no <e> <s> do not seem to me to achieve any clear purpose since the separation of functions between the nra and the plcs is built solidly into the entire fabric of the bill already <e>", "<cs> the noble lord may have misheard me <e> <s> i did point out that it would be very much a possibility for local authorities to offer their expertise <e> <s> i said that earlier in my reply <e>", "<cs> i fear that i may be guilty of confusing or misleading the committee and the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> i was under the impression that amendment no <e> <s> was still grouped with amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> that is no longer the case and therefore i have served him a red herring for which i apologise <e>", "<cs> i fear that i shall not be able to go quite so far as the noble lord lord mcintosh would wish <e> <s> perhaps i may just draw upon two points <e> <s> first my noble friend lord crickhowell referred to practicality <e> <s> there is of course an element of practicality in the matter <e> <s> the connection about which we are talking in no way compromises the independence of the nra in terms of it deciding whether it is happy or not happy with the arrangements <e>", "<cs> the main purpose of these amendments is to require consultation with environmental local authority and other interests before appointments are made to the nra and to provide additional members on the board of the nra to represent particular interests <e>", "<cs> this amendment would remove the requirement for the treasury to approve the remuneration and pensions of nra members <e> <s> it is standard practice for all non-departmental public bodies that if the chairman and members who are appointed by ministers are to be paid then their level of remuneration must be determined by the ministers concerned with treasury approval <e>", "<cs> i tried to make it clear earlier that our intention in the financial memorandum between the department and the nra was to make the situation as flexible as possible in the light of the remarks made by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> these two amendments are designed to bring about changes to the proposed financial arrangements for the national rivers authority <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> would remove the discretionary power of my right honourable friend the secretary of state to require the nra to pay to him any surplus the nra makes on either its revenue or capital accounts <e> <s> it would also have the effect of providing for the creation of financial reserves in respect of the nras various functions and for the carry-over from one financial year to another of any surplus or deficit of the nras accounts <e>", "<cs> yes i did <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> would require the nra to have regard to rather than to consider any representations made to it by an advisory committee <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord also speaking to amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> before replying i should make it clear to the committee that while i completely accept what was said by the noble lord lord mcintosh who gave a rather broader picture by explaining his support for amendment no <e> <s> i shall be responding only to amendments no <e> <s> a and a <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> a would replace the requirement on the director to have regard to the desirability to appoint people to the customer service committees with experience or expertise of the water or sewerage industry by a requirement on the secretary of state to have regard to the desirability of appointing a person with experience or expertise in representing water and sewerage service customers <e> <s> before going any further i think that i should point out to the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal that at present it is not the government who will make the appointments it is the director general <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> a is consequential on amendment no <e> <s> b which requires the secretary of state to have regard to the desirability of appointing one or more people to represent those on low incomes <e> <s> as i explained in relation to amendments nos <e> <s> a and earlier this evening the requirement in subsection that the director should have regard to the relevant expertise of water or sewage undertakers by making appointments to these committees is not an exclusive requirement <e> <s> it is merely a consideration that he should bear in mind in ensuring that the committees deal efficiently with the wider range of customer issues and complaints that they are likely to face <e> <s> this of course could include people on low incomes <e>", "<cs> to an extent by definition those who represent the domestic user and the consumer will think primarily at the start because there is always an area of definition of those who are closest to being marginalised and who are on a low income <e> <s> that will be an area of particular interest <e> <s> i assume that on that basis alone that interest will be to the forefront of their minds <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the feelings in local government about the ending of the present arrangements for direct representation on customer committees as they currently exist <e> <s> they have their roots in the local government origin of much of the water industry <e> <s> but arrangements that were appropriate for public sector utilities are not necessarily appropriate for private sector companies subject to the range of statutory regulation which is provided for in the bill <e>", "<cs> i am sure that your lordships will appreciate that there are considerable advantages in the arrangements under schedule paragraph which would make the appointment of sub-committees permissible but not mandatory <e> <s> the power of the customer service committees to set up local sub-committees subject to the approval of the director provides them with the flexibility in adapting to the needs of their areas and in minimising the burdens especially of travel on their members <e> <s> the director general must of course consider constructively any request for the setting up of sub-committees <e> <s> but he must retain the right to consider each case on its merits so that the most effective use is made of resources and as my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary of state for the environment explained in the other place to avoid any unnecessary proliferation of sub-committees <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> b seeks to ensure that the customer service committees cscs could carry out their functions in relation to the companies allocated to them in co-operation with one or more other committees and would enable them to consider matters which are relevant to <e>", "<cs> there is a certain thread which has run through the last few amendments and i fear on this occasion i am not only going to be in error in front of me but also in error behind me though perhaps in error on different grounds <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mcintosh will clearly see that under financial provisions in paragraph of schedule customer service committees have to prepare financial statements <e> <s> that of itself insinuates that they will be considering what they believe is an appropriate level of expenditure <e> <s> the reason that the director general has to have an overall position is that at the end of the day he will be responsible for the money which is supplied by a vote of parliament <e> <s> it requires parliamentary approval <e> <s> that does not indicate that he is going to refuse to allow the customer service committees to consider what they think is an appropriate level of expenditure <e> <s> i believe that provides rather a different picture of the matter to that which the noble lord has presented <e>", "<cs> i am conscious that the gas act the telecommunications act and the electricity bill have similar wording to that provided for in these amendments in respect of the quality of service provided <e> <s> i should emphasise here the quality of service rather than price fixing <e>", "<cs> in the bill <e>", "<cs> the purpose of this amendment is to provide that no proposals of a relevant body shall jeopardise any scheme established jointly with a <e>", "<cs> amendments nos <e> <s> and relate to clause as the noble lord lord mcintosh pointed out <e> <s> this places the general duty on relevant bodies to have regard to the desirability of preserving public access to their land of amenity value <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> seeks to substitute preserve for have regard to the desirability of preserving <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is consequential upon that <e>", "<cs> this amendment relates to subsection of clause which sets out the general recreational duties of the relevant bodies that is the nra the companies and the internal drainage boards <e> <s> the amendment would subordinate the recreation duty to that for public access <e> <s> such an amendment would undermine the proper balance which we believe should be struck between access and recreation duties <e> <s> it could for instance inhibit the relevant bodies from ever leasing off parts of their land to which there has previously been public access to sporting clubs for specific recreational uses <e> <s> that is something which one might not consider appropriate in many cases but it is surely not something which should be wholly precluded <e> <s> the code of practice requires that putting land in water to best use for recreation involves striking a reasonable balance among public and private uses and the variety of particular leisure pursuits <e> <s> that is surely right <e>", "<cs> the amendments relate to clause which sets out the general recreational duties of the relevant bodies <e> <s> the first point that must be made is that this really is a strong duty it requires the relevant bodies not just to put their water and land to use for recreation but to do so in the best manner <e> <s> it is not only a strong duty it is an important one <e> <s> as the committee will recognise the undertakers will inherit not only the reservoirs a major resource for water recreation but also the upland gathering grounds many of which we recognise are of exceptional amenity value <e> <s> the fact <e>", "<cs> the purpose of these amendments is to place on the internal drainage boards a discretionary duty to promote conservation and recreation in respect of watercourses under their control <e> <s> this promotional duty is a general duty placed upon the nra and is quite separate from its conservation and environmental obligations related to its flood defence and land drainage functions <e>", "<cs> i never like to be thought of as taking advantage of your lordships <e> <s> i thought that as the time was nearly five minutes to eleven it was convenient to be brief <e> <s> i did so only for the convenience of the committee <e>", "<cs> i believe that translucent means clear so when i say that the terms are not the most clear <e>", "<cs> the link there with clause is difficult in drafting terms but it is important because it jointly secures the effect we desire that all the purposes of clause come within the scope of the procedure proposed <e>", "<cs> i believe it means that they can prioritise <e>", "<cs> clause provides a special procedure tailored to the circumstances of the water industry whereby the nature conservancy council can notify sssis to the relevant water bodies and be consulted on any action by those bodies which seems likely to damage or destroy relevant features of the site <e> <s> the point to note is that the sssi procedure already provides means of dealing through management agreements with any disputes <e> <s> this <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> would require that the bodies to which the code is to apply should draw up policies and procedures for fulfilling their duties in clauses and and for implementing the code of practice and publish annually a report describing measures taken in consequence <e> <s> it would also require the secretary of state to review performance at least once every five years <e>", "<cs> as i have just said i am suggesting that there is no possibility today or tomorrow because of the matter of compliance but in the years that lie ahead it is possible and it is not unreasonable <e> <s> the fact is that compliance in the short term does not mean that that is likely <e> <s> it is all very well for the noble lord lord mcintosh to smile and stroke his head but the fact is that he cannot say with certainty that there is no possibility of <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make one point <e> <s> i have always considered it a great privilege to be a member of this chamber <e> <s> i take issue with the noble lord lord graham <e> <s> i would never deride or rubbish the noble lord lord mcintosh for whom i have the highest regard as i am sure he knows <e>", "<cs> this group of amendments provides for the notification of local authorities on modification or termination of appointments <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> a requires that the secretary of state or director shall notify local authorities of his intention to terminate or vary a companys appointment and shall publish such a notice <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> b is an alternative and requires that the local authority shall be notified when the company is served with notice of termination or variation <e> <s> the three amendments to clause require that notices shall also be served on local authorities acting as sewerage agents <e>", "<cs> in relation to the specific point concerning a local authority which has an agency in a different area if that is the correct interpretation of what the noble lord lord mcintosh said we should like to consider the matter <e>", "<cs> the purpose of these amendments is to provide for conditions in the instrument of appointment of a company to require compensation to be paid by the appointee for breaches of any <e>", "<cs> in answer to the last point made by my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls the situation is entirely covered by the guaranteed standards scheme <e>", "<cs> the effect of this amendment would be to impose an obligation on water and sewerage undertakers to ensure that for a prescribed proportion of works contracts which they enter into they have first to ensure that the contract has been the subject of competitive tendering in a similar way to the requirements of section of the local government act <e>", "<cs> the first point to make to the noble lord lord graham is that we are not proposing to abolish anything <e> <s> we are seeing the water authorities being divided <e> <s> but in abolishing bodies like the glc and the metropolitan authorities where staff contracts could not have anticipated the authorities demise it was proper to consider whether special redundancy provisions were justified <e> <s> the glc abolition provisions were different because the legislation concerned provided for redundancies <e>", "<cs> in order to make the position absolutely clear i shall quote from page of the bill <e> <s> paragraph e of schedule states <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that i can go much further than i have already <e> <s> i answered the point clearly when i replied on the first question <e>", "<cs> the amendment restricts the discretion of the secretary of state to issue directions to the director general of water services concerning the exclusion of matters in mmc reports when they are published <e> <s> the amendment would have the effect of excluding the secretary of states powers to make such directions when he judges that publication will be against the commercial interests of any person <e> <s> it substitutes the power for him to make directions against publication when in his view publication will be unreasonably damaging to the interests of any person other than the appointed company <e>", "<cs> my lords i assume that the noble lord is referring back to his earlier remarks concerning the moorlands association and the access interest <e> <s> we are considering these matters at the moment very carefully

by my right honourable friend the prime minister at which global warming was discussed <e> <s> it was a very important seminar <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have resolutely upheld green belt policy <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment has demonstrated this commitment by consistently dismissing proposals for inappropriate development in the green belt <e> <s> since the area of approved green belt in england has more than doubled to million acres and now covers per cent <e> <s> of the total land area <e>", "<cs> my lords the secretary of state for the environment has recently dismissed several proposals for inappropriate development in the green belt <e> <s> these included proposals for a research and development centre in the west midlands

referring to european directives which i am sure comes as no surprise to the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> as regards the latest state of play i believe that my noble friend lord caithness has this very week received a letter from the commissioner confirming the arrangements which were agreed with the government <e>", "<cs> under this amendment the duties of a water undertaker concerning the quality of water it supplies would be enforced instead of enforceable by the secretary of state under clause <e> <s> we believe that the amendment would have no substantive effect as in either case the secretary of state will be bound to operate in accordance with clause <e> <s> the change of word here does not affect how he operates under clause as that is laid down by the clause itself <e> <s> as i explained to the committee on monday the amendments to clause will impose a duty on the secretary of state to enforce clause subject to the provisions of clause and <e>", "<cs> the effect of this new clause would be that the secretary of state would have to publish standards of wholesomeness explanation of the regulations made under clause and the time by which each undertaker will have to achieve compliance with the standards <e>", "<cs> i am not sure whether it is entirely appropriate that we should return to clause but i shall try to answer the point which the noble lord lord mcintosh has raised <e> <s> the subject of mondays debate is very pertinent to the amendments which we are debating now and i think it will be helpful if i try to answer the questions of the noble lord lord mcintosh <e>", "<cs> i am sure the noble lord lord mcintosh would be very surprised to find me falling into the same trap as the friends of the earth <e> <s> perhaps i may rectify what i did not answer the previous time i rose to the dispatch box and say that a copy of the letter will be placed in the library <e>", "<cs> the effect of this amendment would be to turn the power to make regulations for preserving water quality into a duty <e> <s> for all practical purposes there is no difference between may and shall as it is hardly conceivable that the secretary of state would not make such regulations <e> <s> for instance they are required in order to implement certain parts of the ec drinking water directive <e>", "<cs> the effect of the amendment would be to transfer responsibility for monitoring the quality of water supplied by a water undertaker from the undertaker to the director general of water services <e>", "<cs> under this amendment the secretary of state would be empowered to make regulations requiring water undertakers to include with customers water bills a statement on water quality in the area including details of any failures to meet the quality standards set by regulations under clause <e> <s> however there is a slight difference between the way water flows through ones tap on a universal basis and purchasing a product which is packaged or in a bottle on an individual basis <e>", "<cs> there is a slight difference between water and gas <e> <s> i say that as a consumer myself <e> <s> it is easier to see whether one is getting what one wishes in terms of a calorific value than as regards the rather more detailed provisions for water <e> <s> the provisions for water are of a different nature to something which can be assessed against the cost of a heating bill <e> <s> we believe that the system of allowing information on water quality to be freely available from undertakers and for it to be consulted as often as consumers wish is as good as printing a once-a-year result on the bill that is to be sent out <e>", "<cs> there are standards for water <e>", "<cs> the amendment would prevent any regulations made concerning a water undertakers compliance with its duty to supply wholesome water <e>", "<cs> these amendments would place a duty on the secretary of state when making regulations concerning the publication and provision of information by a water undertaker to require the water undertaker to publish information on water quality data obtained while monitoring domestic water supplies <e>", "<cs> the effect of amendment no <e> <s> zf would be to allow any person or body to institute proceedings where a water undertaker supplies water unfit for human consumption <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> zfb would allow a local authority to institute proceedings as well as the secretary of state and the dpp <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> zfa would permit any consumer or customers services committee to request the secretary of state the dpp or a local authority to institute proceedings under clause <e>", "<cs> he can <e>", "<cs> as i said earlier the local authorities have an important role to play in this matter <e> <s> certainly they could test the water at the same time as the whisky <e> <s> if the water were unfit they would draw it to the secretary of states attention <e>", "<cs> the object of the exercise is that they either comply or do not comply <e>", "<cs> the purpose of this new clause is to make water undertakers liable to pay compensation to consumers who have suffered damage or loss as a result of being supplied with water unfit for human consumption <e> <s> the second part of the new clause would make successor bodies liable where the loss was caused by water supplied by their predecessors <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should repeat what i said earlier <e> <s> i was saying in relation to time that litigation is always lengthy <e> <s> that is a fact and there is no point in the noble lord lord graham attempting to question me further about it <e> <s> he suggests that there will be some change in the approach of trying to settle out of court <e> <s> my experience is that all people <e>", "<cs> clause provides that in certain cases where it is not practicable at reasonable cost <e>", "<cs> i fully accept that the term private supply as the noble lord lord graham has <e>", "<cs> the clause imposes duties on local authorities to keep themselves informed about the wholesomeness and sufficiency of all water supplies in their areas <e> <s> it sets out the procedure to be followed if a local authority has reason to believe that any water undertakers supply is unwholesome or insufficient <e> <s> regulations to be made under the clause will require and enable local authorities to obtain information about the quality and sufficiency of water supplies in their areas <e> <s> they will also set out how they are to perform their functions under the clause <e> <s> among the matters which may be covered in the regulations are the frequency of sampling and the recovery of costs incurred by local authorities in carrying out their duties <e> <s> i am sure that will be welcomed <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness asked her question in two parts <e> <s> as regards the first as the noble baroness pointed out when she intervened earlier there were no amendments down to this clause and i have a considerable amount of information upon it but i do not have the relationship with the act <e> <s> therefore i hope that the noble baroness will accept that statement and will accept a letter from me in order to clarify the question which she asked <e>", "<cs> there is a source of charge and a source of revenue <e> <s> one anticipates that the source of charge will be met in part by the charge for the testing of private supplies the revenue support grant will need to take account of extra costs for local authorities arising from this bill <e>", "<cs> no and i shall not be able to be of much more help <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord lord graham is labouring under a misapprehension that the charge for a test will only be in the case of a test which fails <e> <s> my understanding is that there will be a charge for the test <e>", "<cs> i think this is now the third time that i have said this <e> <s> the bill does not impose any new burdens on local authorities in respect of public supplies only for private supplies and establishment charges and overheads can be recovered when private supplies are sampled <e> <s> most of the costs of local authorities are likely to relate to these supplies <e>", "<cs> the amendment is concerned with the powers of local authorities under clause to serve notices on owners or recipients of a private water supply requiring them to take certain action to improve the supply to comply with the drinking water quality standards <e> <s> the amendment would require local authorities to take account of the rights and obligations of those owners and recipients of the supply and also whether the water was fit for human consumption <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord mcintosh put it so succinctly a large part of the argument on this subject was deployed earlier today <e> <s> the responsibility for making and enforcing the drinking water quality regulations will rest with the secretary of state <e> <s> as i pointed out then i shall not replay the argument i made one of the grounds on which we feel that this is important among others is that of public health <e> <s> we believe that because there is no basis for giving the director general responsibility for the technical assessors whose job it will be to assess compliance with the regulations <e>", "<cs> i hope that with the flexibility which we anticipate for it centralism is the very last thought that would be on the inspectorates mind <e> <s> at the moment we are giving the matter our closest consideration <e> <s> the inspectorates duties will be onerous <e> <s> i can assure members of the committee that the necessary resources which i suspect are the key to this will be made available for it <e> <s> i think it is fair to say that there is no question of a small team sallying forth in bowler hats from marsham street on a daily basis <e> <s> i suspect that the members of the team will be distributed around the country although of course reporting back to marsham street <e>", "<cs> this amendment would prevent the secretary of state from appointing as a technical assessor anyone employed directly or indirectly by a water undertaker <e> <s> the technical assessors to be appointed under clause will form the new drinking water inspectorate to be established shortly <e> <s> this inspectorate will be responsible for carrying out a technical audit of the undertakers records and practices on assessing and safeguarding drinking water quality <e> <s> they will check to make quite sure that a water undertaker is complying with the various obligations placed on it concerning the quality of its own water supplies <e> <s> compliance with the quality standards and action taken when there is a breach of a standard will certainly be investigated <e> <s> sampling arrangements and analytical methods will also be checked as will the information made available to the public <e> <s> i hope the committee will agree with me that it would be completely unacceptable to appoint as a technical assessor anyone employed by a water undertaker <e> <s> i can give an unqualified assurance to the noble lord lord ross of newport that we have no intention of doing so <e>", "<cs> we have been round this track a number of times today in some ways <e> <s> this amendment would require the secretary of state to obtain the approval of the director general before making provision by regulations for standards of wholesomeness <e>", "<cs> the effect of this amendment is to add to general sewerage duty in clause a specific duty for sewerage undertakers to provide mains drainage for all communities with more than one hundred inhabitants <e> <s> undertakers would be required to draw up plans for each community in consultation with the local authority concerned and to implement each year one-twentieth by value of the resulting programme of schemes <e>", "<cs> i believe that we come to an amendment later on this subject and into which we can go in more detail <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> would add to the general duties of sewerage undertakers set out in subsection of clause a further duty to make reasonable provision for the reception and disposal of such trade effluents arising in the area covered by their appointments as it is appropriate to dispose of through public sewers <e> <s> this further duty would be without prejudice to the generality of the duties in paragraphs a and b of subsection <e>", "<cs> what an interesting little amendment <e> <s> i am sure that it could keep us here for several hours <e> <s> it has all the potential of developing in every direction towards sea or land <e> <s> the purpose of this amendment is to ensure that where they are used sea outfalls shall discharge at a distance of not less that two kilometres from the nearest land or greater if necessary in order to take account of the effects of tides or of detergents in sewage as my noble friend lord stanley of alderley drew to our attention <e> <s> the aim of the amendment is to ensure that coastal areas remain unpolluted <e> <s> the government fully share this objective with my noble friend lord stanley and consider that the objective would be met by the provisions of the bill as it stands and will not be served by adopting the amendment <e>", "<cs> as i am sure my noble friend

lord lord mcintosh wishes the secretary of state to make regulations <e> <s> i believe that that is quite an important point because there is a parallel here <e> <s> i remind the noble lord that on monday we made it clear that we foresaw this happening <e> <s> he wishes to ensure that this is on the face of the bill but on monday we decided that we would agree to differ on the principle of achieving the same aim <e> <s> that is what i was trying to explain just now in an inadequate way for which i apologise <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> c would require the regulations under subsection to be made before the sale of shares in any undertaker <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> d would require the same regulations to prescribe detailed standards <e> <s> amendment nof would insert a new subsection a in clause requiring the publication of any regulations under subsection to be accompanied by such plans for the management of the undertakers assets as the secretary of state considers appropriate in connection with standards of performance prescribed under this clause <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> g would require the local authorities in connection with their role as sewerage agents to be consulted before regulations under subsection are made and copies of the regulations to be sent to the sewerage agents <e> <s> the fact is that the functional responsibilities lie with the undertakers themselves <e> <s> furthermore regulations may relate to matters which are in no way reflected in the role of the sewerage agents or to specific areas in which there may be no agency <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> h seeks to ensure that the regulations to be prescribed under subsection will include foul flooding and that such inclusion in these regulations would be without prejudice to an individuals right to take action under any other part of this bill <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> a would impose on sewerage undertakers the duty to carry out rodent control within sewers <e> <s> it would effectively <e>", "<cs> the proposal to construct sewers to specified standards with a view to their automatic adoption was discussed in the consultation paper on the review of water and sewerage law <e> <s> we looked very closely at this question following the review in the light of the comments received <e> <s> our aim was to develop a procedure for the automatic adoption of all newly constructed sewers which gave undertakers the opportunity to resist adoption of sewers which had been inadequately constructed or were unnecessarily expensive to maintain while protecting developers from the imposition of unreasonable standards by the undertakers <e> <s> such a procedure would have to provide for both these requirements without subjecting developers to costly delays in starting work on site <e> <s> after lengthy consideration and further consultation with interested parties we concluded that the proposal could not be implemented in a way that would be fair and would meet the reasonable requirements of both parties <e>", "<cs> at present discharge of trade effluent without the consent of the water authority or in breach of the terms of its consent is an offence <e> <s> it has been argued that because in future the sewerage undertaker will be a privately owned company it is wrong in principle for the undertaker to be able to determine what shall constitute an offence on the part of another company and wrong for one company to be able to prosecute another <e> <s> i recognise the instincts which might lead one towards those conclusions and i will therefore try to explain with some care why we attach importance to the present provision in schedule <e>", "<cs> i can give an example of three <e> <s> associated british ports sealink ltd and the felixstowe dock and railway company can all prosecute <e>", "<cs> the purpose of this power is not to gain commercial advantage nor do i suspect that the companies that i mentioned do <e> <s> the noble earl derides the example of the shop but i also pointed to the example of a company which owns a fishing interest and which would be entirely entitled to prosecute a sewerage undertaker if there was a discharge into a river <e> <s> we are talking about ensuring that the system works <e> <s> the only way to do that is if the undertaker is able to prosecute in the event that there is a discharge of effluents or anything else which has been done without a licence <e>", "<cs> one of the main effects of paragraphs to of schedule upon existing legislation concerning discharge of trade effluents is to give the director general responsibility for determining appeals concerning trade effluent consents in place of the secretary of state <e> <s> paragraph amends the public health drainage of trade premises act in that way <e>", "<cs> at present trade effluent agreements and variations to consents are publicly available under the public health drainage of premises act the public health act and the control of pollution act <e> <s> because trade effluents flow through public sewers under our streets and the contents after treatment ultimately are discharged into the environment there is a legitimate public interest in these matters <e> <s> i have already spoken about the relationship between the undertakers and dischargers under our discussion on amendment no <e>

amendment be rejected <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> a provides for the addition to that consolidated list of a requirement to disclose analyses of samples taken of a trade effluent that is the subject of a consent <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> b would provide that where a discharger satisfies the secretary of state that it would be contrary to the public interest or would prejudice to an unreasonable degree some private interest he may obtain from the secretary of state a certificate of exemption from disclosing certain items on the public register <e> <s> a similar provision to this already exists with respect to the nras register of consents <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord lord mcintosh for having misinterpreted him <e> <s> these three amendments bring us to a series of amendments on this clause which try to ensure a continuing role for local authorities in sewerage work <e> <s> i should say by way of introduction that we do not differ at all from the proposers of these amendments in wishing to see a continuing role for local authorities in this field where they provide a cost-effective service <e> <s> i am concerned however with the rigidity which these amendments would introduce into arrangements between sewerage undertakers and local authorities <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> zc requires the undertaker to notify the authority of any decision to seek tenders for work connected with the discharge of its sewerage functions <e> <s> i shall deal with it together with amendment no <e> <s> a which requires the undertaker to give the authority an opportunity to tender for those functions where a sewerage undertaker refuses to enter into an arrangement with a local authority which that authority has indicated that it wishes to retain or to undertake for the first time <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> b would have effect where a sewerage undertaker refused to enter into an arrangement with a local authority which wished either to retain the agency function or to undertake it for the first time <e> <s> it is an alternative to amendment no <e> <s> a and requires the undertaker to publish the reasons for its refusal with reference to a value-for-money comparison of the relative ability of the undertaker and the authority to perform those functions <e>", "<cs> we now reach amendment no <e> <s> c which enables local authorities through a widening of a definition of public bodies under the local authorities goods and services act to enter into arrangements to provide all water and sewerage undertakers with goods or services or to carry out works and maintenance in connection with land or buildings for which the undertaker is responsible <e>", "<cs> i specifically referred to this clause and to the arrangements and not to other clauses <e>", "<cs> i can go no further than repeat exactly what i said before <e> <s> it is a reference purely to this clause <e>", "<cs> as noble lords have pointed out this group of amendments concerns payments by instalments <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> za would provide for optional arrangements for payments of metered supplies by instalments under regulations made under subsection of clause <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> zb would extend that provision to cover any scheme for charges in respect of domestic customers made under clause <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> c would require water and sewerage undertakers to make provisions to enable payments of charges to be made on a weekly basis <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mcintosh is absolutely right to say that we have travelled over a certain amount of this ground before <e> <s> i quite understand why he wishes to go over it again <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> requires that in setting charges undertakers may have particular regard to the needs of those disabled and chronically sick who have a need to consume above average quantities of water <e> <s> the purpose of amendment no <e> <s> is to require my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment to make regulations under clause which would make particular provision for the disabled or those of pensionable age with respect to the installation connection disconnection maintenance authentication and testing of meters and related matters <e>", "<cs> this amendment would enable my right honourable friend the secretary of state to make regulations providing for the rating valuation list made under the general rate act to be amended to include valuations for dwellings that have been altered or erected after st march <e> <s> it would provide an expensive and undesirable method for maintaining the domestic rating systems for water charging purposes until the prohibition on the use of rateable values provided for by this clause comes into effect on st april <e>", "<cs> this clause will prevent water and sewerage undertakers from fixing any charges to both domestic and non-domestic customers by direct or indirect reference to any rateable value after st march <e> <s> the domestic rating system will be abolished on the introduction of the community charge next april <e> <s> as domestic rateable values become increasingly out of date it will become increasingly inappropriate to use them as the basis for water and sewerage charges even more so than it is now <e> <s> the new water services companies will therefore have to find alternative means of charging their customers <e> <s> options currently being considered by the water industry include metering and a flat rate charge possibly with extra charges for the use of hosepipes and sprinklers or a combination of both methods <e> <s> it will be for each company to decide which method or methods of charging to adopt in the light of its own circumstances and the results of the metering trials <e>", "<cs> clause prohibits water undertakers from charging for water taken to extinguish fires or test fire fighting equipment or for the availability of water for those purposes <e> <s> it is based upon section of the water act which although it was never brought into force is to be <e>", "<cs> these amendments relate to the provisions in clause under which shareholders who object to a statutory water companys resolution to replace its constitution with a new memorandum and articles can apply to the courts to have the resolution cancelled <e> <s> one amendment would restrict rights of access to the courts in these circumstances <e> <s> the other three would remove the power of the courts to cancel the resolution and would substitute a discretionary power to award cash compenstion for the diminution in value of those members interests <e>", "<cs> amendments nos <e> <s> k and l would allow statutory water companies to change their debentures so that instead of the debentures rights being embedded in local statutes they would take a non-statutory form <e> <s> in many ways the two new clauses which would be introduced by these two amendments parallel clauses and which allow a statutory water company to substitute a memorandum and articles for its current statutory constitution <e> <s> the approval of per cent <e> <s> of each class of debenture holder would be required to enable changes to be made and aggrieved minorities would have access to the courts for redress <e>", "<cs> these amendments are designed to allow the water quality classifications under clause to provide for the needs of nature conservation thereby allowing the objectives which will be set under clause to include conservation goals <e>", "<cs> i have tried to make it as clear as possible that the object of drafting subsection in the widest possible terms was in order to exclude no one <e> <s> it is a different approach to finish up with the same answer <e>", "<cs> the amendment refers to clause which places a general duty on the secretary of state and the nra to use all their powers to achieve water quality and to monitor the quality of controlled waters <e>", "<cs> in replying to amendment no <e> <s> g i propose to speak also to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> the effect of this amendment no <e> <s> g would

act <e>", "<cs> there are not the powers by regulation to carry out what my noble friend asks <e>", "<cs> the amendment seeks to provide that protection zones be designated as environmentally sensitive areas <e>", "<cs> the government have already indicated during the discussion of the bill in another place that they will give consideration to the general <e>", "<cs> clause gives the nra the power to make by-laws to regulate certain polluting activities for instance washing or cleaning of vessels or other matter and the use of vessels with sanitary appliances on any controlled waters <e> <s> this amendment seeks to exempt reservoirs owned by the water undertakers from this control <e>", "<cs> the control of discharges from abandoned mines is a matter of great legal and technical difficulty <e> <s> not only is it often very difficult to identify the cause of the discharge it is frequently uncertain where any legal liability may rest <e> <s> for these reasons it has not seemed appropriate to allow the nra to recover the costs of operations it may undertake to remedy or prevent such discharge from persons most probably the landowners at the discharge point who have not caused the discharge to occur but simply permitted it in the sense of not themselves taking steps to stop it <e>", "<cs> amendments nos <e> <s> c and d concern clause <e> <s> the clause is the successor to section of the control of pollution act under which the water authorities have kept public registers containing details of river quality sampling effluent discharge consents and the

report to cover all the authoritys important functions <e> <s> i find it inconceivable that it would omit these <e> <s> but for the avoidance of doubt we will endeavour to make stronger reference to the mattter in the code of practice covering the performance of clauses and duties <e> <s> i believe that this is the right way to do it rather than singling out this particular function on the face of the bill <e> <s> with that assurance i hope that the noble lord will feel he has achieved his purpose <e>", "<cs> the responsibility for mapping sewers currently rests with local authorities <e> <s> the maps are not as comprehensive as they might be and sewerage undertakers are therefore being given years to investigate and record as far as practicable the extent of the public sewerage system

"<cs> we considered these offences very carefully when we drafted the bill <e> <s> while i appreciate my noble friends concern we do not consider that a person who negligently interferes with pipes or apparatus of the nra or water undertakers but who causes no damage should be guilty of an offence <e>", "<cs> the bill provides powers of entry as of right to private property only where those powers are essential for undertakers to fulfil their statutory functions <e> <s> proper safeguards are provided for occupiers of premises in terms of the requirements for notice to be served and for entry to be exercised at a reasonable time <e>", "<cs> there is no need to explicitly require that these containers be clean and sterile for if they are not clean and sterile they clearly cannot be used for

removed any control on numbers of employees of the nra thereby i believe satisfactorily answering his point in that area the noble lord then turned the agrument round and said we were not talking

to this group of government amendments <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> a proposed by the noble lord lord mcintosh requires that per cent <e> <s> of the proceeds of disposals goes to the customers <e> <s> the effect of the governments amendments is to ensure that a fair share of the proceeds from the disposals of land goes to customers while leaving the companies with an incentive to make efficient use of land to make every effort to dispose of land which is surplus and to secure that the customer benefits from the best obtainable price <e>", "<cs> my lords that is correct up to a point <e> <s> however in a way the noble lords comments negate his amendment to some extent because of the powers that he has described the secretary of state as having <e>", "<cs> my lords i am just coming to that

water act as i said earlier in my false commencement of replying to these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are happy to support the amendments standing in the name of the noble lord lord

place upon the secretary of state the minister and the director an obligation to exercise their own powers under part i of the bill in the way that best secures fulfilment by the relevant bodies of

the house i have already replied to the amendment <e> <s> there is nothing i can usefully add to what i have already said <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of amendment no <e> <s> a would be to delete

are indeed two and a half hours left <e> <s> we suggest that there is no good purpose <e> <s> authorities are already charging the market rate for their specialised facilities and the market would in

the leave of the house i should like to extend the point made by my noble friend lord trafford and give an example of more expense which lies in the grey area which i know that the noble lord lord mcintosh is convinced does not exist <e> <s> suppose that a water ski ramp which cost a considerable sum of money was erected <e> <s> it was used by a very small number of people but the usage increased and it now has to be replaced <e> <s> at the time that it was built say years ago there were very few people using the lake on which it was used but now there is a far greater level of

why we are resisting it <e>", "<cs> my lords we have already today considered public access to water industry land and the house may feel that there is little more now that needs to be said <e> <s> however my noble friends lord renton and lord balfour pointed out that there is quite a lot more which can be said on this amendment <e> <s> for my part i will not rehearse arguments which we have already extensively pursued but will concentrate on only one critical feature to which in relation to this amendment we have already referred <e>", "<cs> my lords clause as presently drafted requires relevant bodies that is the national rivers authority water and sewerage undertakers and internal drainage boards to consult the nature conservancy council or the national park or broads authorities before doing anything which the relevant bodies think might cause damage to sites notified to them by the council or the authorities as being of environmental importance <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of the amendment would be that if the nature conservancy council objected to an operation which a relevant body the nra an undertaker or a drainage board planned to carry out and if the reason for the councils objection was that the operation would harm a site of special scientific interest the relevant body if it carried out that operation would be guilty of an offence under section of the wildlife and countryside act unless it had given the council four months notice of its intention to go ahead with the operation and the notice had expired or unless some other condition had been fulfilled for example the council had given its written consent to the operation or the operation had been executed immediately because of an emergency <e>", "<cs> my lords clause provides for the

what has to be an easy to operate no quibble scheme to cover the complexity of the conditions of appointment and it is in no way a substitute for the right of civil redress <e> <s> i hope that this reasoning will persuade the noble lord to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am sure that the noble lord remembers the interesting exchange which we had on this matter in committee <e> <s> the point which i should like to reiterate to him is that the new guaranteed standards scheme is something which does not exist <e> <s> it is a major step forward <e> <s> we believe that he asks for a step forward beyond that <e> <s> we should learn to walk before we can run if i may put it in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i can certainly give my noble friend the assurance that he requires <e>", "<cs> my lords the developers are having archaeological investigation carried out into the adjacent areas which would be affected by the

the site <e> <s> as i said in an earlier reply preceding the piling the developers will have archaeologists under the supervision of english heritage to investigate what is down there <e>", "<cs> my

dared not ask <e> <s> clause sets out the circumstances in which a water undertaker is able to cut off or reduce supplies of water <e> <s> subsection requires an undertaker to serve notice on the relevant local authority within hours of cutting off a supply to an inhabited house <e> <s> this requirement is for public health reasons <e> <s> the purpose of amendment no <e> <s> c is to limit the requirement to notify the local authority to those disconnections that the undertaker has reason to believe will last longer than hours <e> <s> my noble friend lady blatch explained that the reason behind her amendment is concern that under the provisions as they stand the water undertaker will be required to notify the local authority even of disconnections that last no more than an hour or two <e>", "<cs> i undertook at second reading to look into the matter of whether the garden-only situation was adequately covered and to take appropriate action after discussion with the sponsors <e> <s> the amendment gives effect to that undertaking and removes the ambiguity that previously existed <e>", "<cs> i think i should clarify the situation <e> <s> not all the outstanding issues have been completely resolved and that is part of the reason why we have not yet been able to consider a firm date <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect if amendment no <e> <s> would be to enable the customer services committee for the area affected to institute proceedings where it believes a water undertaker has supplied water unfit for human consumption <e> <s> clause as it stands restricts the power to prosecute to the secretary of state and the director of public prosecutions <e> <s> we discussed a similar amendment during the committee stage of the bill and while i understand the good intentions of the noble lord lord addington in tabling this amendment i must reiterate what i said then <e> <s> the government believe that the power to prosecute should rest with the public authority which is charged with enforcing quality standards <e> <s> for public supplies the secretary of state is the enforcing body <e> <s> the prosecution power in clause is one of the weapons he can use to carry out that responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords the customer service committees will report directly to the director general <e> <s> they will have an important job which is to be vigilant <e> <s> we expect them to be so as the noble lord also wishes <e> <s> on that point i feel that there is agreement on both sides of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment would enable the secretary of state to make regulations requiring a local authority to notify him of any additional non-revenue costs arising from clause so that he could provide a grant to cover those costs <e> <s> the noble lord lord gallacher will not be <e>", "<cs> my lords we return to the subject on which i believe the noble lord lord mcintosh at an earlier stage of the bill questioned me as to whether a lot of gentlemen in bowler hats would be emerging on a daily basis from marsham street in order to inquire into matters concerning drinking water <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is entirely correct <e> <s> these amendments would require the director general of water services to appoint technical assessors of drinking water quality instead of the secretary of state <e> <s> they would also require him to establish local divisions of assessors and enable the assessors to report to the director on any breach or likely breach of the drinking water quality standards <e>", "<cs> my lords i always try to be as helpful as possible to the noble lord lord graham but he will understand me when i say that i cannot be of any assistance in trying to legislate an improvement in the weather or a colder winter <e> <s> the purpose of amendment no <e> <s> za is to amend the regulation-making powers set out in subsection of clause <e> <s> clause has two purposes <e> <s> the first is a reserve power enabling the secretary of state to make regulations at the directors request establishing certain service requirements which undertakers must meet as set out in subsection <e> <s> if those requirements are not met they will amount to breaches of the sewerage undertakers general duty as set out in clause <e> <s> the second is to enable regulations to be made by the same procedure to prescribe standards in the day-to-day relations between sewerage undertakers and individual customers as set out in clause <e> <s> that is the guaranteed standards scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may say that the problem of rats as a result of two warm winters goes far beyond the reach of the sewers and the water industry <e> <s> there has been a huge increase in the rat population in the countryside <e> <s> at the end of the day the fact of the matter is that wherever that has occurred good management is required to curb the population <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord shannon moved a similar amendment in committee <e> <s> its effect is to amend paragraph c of schedule concerning legislation governing the discharge of trade effluents into public sewers so that where such discharges are made without the consent of the sewerage undertaker or in breach of the terms of a consent there would no longer be a criminal offence as there has been for over years as my noble friend lord renton pointed out <e> <s> instead the only control over what effluents from trade processes may go into a public sewer would be civil action for damages against the persons responsible <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments would maintain a right of appeal to the secretary of state for local authorities virtually identical to that of the water act following notice of termination of existing sewerage arrangements from an undertaker <e> <s> the secretary of state would then have the power to confirm vary or terminate arrangements as he saw fit <e> <s> this amendment is based on a refusal to recognise two guiding principles of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord graham will be aware of our position <e> <s> we believe that the companies should be allowed to make arrangements which they consider to be entirely satisfactory <e> <s> we believe that a great number of local authorities will continue to carry out the job which they have done satisfactorily to date

undertaker is not happy it will discuss the matter with the agent which may be a local authority <e> <s> it may not be fulfilling the job which the undertaker wants doing at the price it wants it done

reference to the secretary of state if the authority is not happy with a commercial undertaking <e> <s> that is why we are resisting the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of the amendment is to prevent a water or sewerage undertaker levying an initial charge on a person for whom the undertaker is becoming the provider of recreational facilities or services <e> <s> i expect many of your lordships will find my account of the effect of the amendment rather obscure <e> <s> the obscurity we believe is unavoidable <e> <s> the amendment deals with charging for recreation while clause to

the leave of the house i have not fully understood the point made by the noble lord lord ross <e> <s> it would be best if i read the <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of the new clause moved by the noble lord lord hooson is to ensure that the successor companies of the water authorities when disposing of land adjoining water or when disposing of fishing rights give the same importance to

definition purely to establish the present existence of the arrangements with english heritage <e>", "<cs> my lords as i tried to explain earlier there is a differential which is at the request of the church of england with regard to the commitment by english heritage <e> <s> the differential is that the money should be targeted from english heritage towards ordinary parish churches so to speak and

the same answer to the noble lord lord parry as i gave to my noble friend lord lauderdale <e> <s> i would not wish to be inaccurate in answering such a question <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my

house <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lady blatch raised the point in committee that present control of pollution legislation does not provide for injunctions to be sought in the sort of cases to

authority would be required when deciding whether to grant permission to take account of the fact if it were a fact that the new buildings might reduce pollution and promote good agricultural practice

should be order mapped to national grid reference hydrometric sub-catchments <e>", "<cs> my lords section of the water resources act provides for the revocation or variation of licences to abstract

scientific interest <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of the proposed new clause would be to required first that the director set up a water environment fund into which water and sewerage undertakers

when he says that the bill goes to another place from here <e> <s> i shall draw his remarks to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment which the noble lord lord harris has moved anticipates amendments nos <e> <s> to standing in my name <e> <s> i think that it may be for the convenience of the house if i speak to both my amendments and to his at the same time <e>", "<cs> my lords i dealt with that point in my speech <e> <s> the position of the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to rehearse once more the reasons why this bill is necessary <e> <s> football hooliganism remains a major problem both at home and overseas <e> <s> the bill provides further powerful measures to deal with the problem on both these fronts <e>", "<cs> my lords under clause the secretary of state or the director is required to make <e>", "<cs> my lords clause requires the director general to maintain a register of key documents and decisions relating to the appointments of water and sewerage undertakers <e> <s> the register will hold details of appointments variations and terminations of appointments and of modifications of conditions of appointment <e> <s> it will also contain details of directions consents and determinations given and enforcement orders made by the director and of undertakings given by the appointed companies under clause <e>", "<cs> my lords clause defines the circumstances in which a water undertaker owes a domestic supply duty to particular premises <e> <s> clause gives an undertaker the right in certain circumstances to require the provision of separate service pipes to provide a supply of water to separately occupied premises <e> <s> clause sets out the requirements on undertakers in respect of the constancy and the pressure of water supplied to those premises <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment would enable a police constable in addition to the director of public prosecutions and the secretary of state to prosecute a water undertaker for supplying water unfit for human consumption <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment would allow a sewerage agent to require that the provisions of the local government agency arrangements staff transfer and protection order should apply to any sewerage agency arrangement <e> <s> this order specifies in some considerable detail the terms on which staff would be transferred if they were transferred on variation or termination of the arrangement <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully appreciate the point that the noble lord lord mcintosh has made <e> <s> i hope that he will understand that i feel that i should reply to his amendment albeit briefly because that would be as appropriate as trying to answer his question <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments would provide that the consent powers of the secretary of state for the disposal of environmentally sensitive land in clause should be subject to substantial obligations in respect of public consultation through advertisement in local papers the <e>", "<cs> my lords the important point is that consultation takes place <e> <s> i do not have with me information as to the exact period of time but i shall certainly let the noble lord lord graham know <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall specify a period in the general authorisation <e> <s> obviously we shall take into account what the noble lord lord graham has said this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i am speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> to and to <e> <s> i apologise deeply to the house for not having said so at the start <e>", "<cs> my lords i was just coming to the point which the noble lord lord mcintosh has raised <e> <s> i propose that it would be sensible for me to speak to the government amendments and at the end of the debate answer the opposition amendments if that would be satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i could first answer the question of my noble friend lord balfour concerning the error which i pointed out and which he did not pick up <e> <s> the error is on the third line <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment from the noble lord lord norrie is to require that the clause duties more importantly the duty to further conservation of flora fauna natural beauty etc <e> <s> shall apply to the secretary of states consideration of all disposals not simply those which are within the national parks areas of outstanding natural beauty and other designated areas <e>", "<cs> in answer to the noble baronesss question i can immediately off the cuff give two examples one is rutland water and the other is grafham water which provide enormous pleasure to thousands of people <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i can persuade the movers of these amendments that they are unnecessary and should be withdrawn <e> <s> as i have said to noble lords on previous occasions fluoridation in this country is carried out according to guidelines laid down by the standing technical advisory committee on water quality <e> <s> those guidelines impose an upper limit on the concentration of fluoride in the water supply resulting from a fluoridation scheme of milligrams per litre <e> <s> the upper limit allows a very wide margin of safety <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all members of your lordships house will be very happy that the noble lord lord jenkins is happy with the scheme <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that the royal opera house authorities have been in touch with the covent garden community association <e> <s> as the noble lord pointed out the authorities of the royal opera house have recently had discussions with the theatres trust and are preparing to meet the association of british theatre technicians and the covent garden trust <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly bring those comments to the attention of my noble friend lord brabazon <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the royal opera house authorities are in regular touch with the covent garden community association <e>", "<cs> yes i am <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall check on what the noble lord said <e>", "<cs> my lords a little further on i shall come to the important part of the matter which is the amount of the money itself <e> <s> that appertains to the whole of this issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite understand the point made by the noble lord lord mcintosh but i think it is important to understand how the sums of money have changed very considerably in actuality over that period of time <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that it is fair to say that a considerable amount in local government does not accord with modern accounting practice and has developed over the years in a rather different way <e>", "<cs> my lords that will be by regulation <e>", "<cs> my lords attending as i was to the noble lord lord mcintosh i had not looked behind and was unaware of the situation of which he has now informed me <e> <s> i shall endeavour to do my best not to repeat what the noble lord clearly finds unacceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i am right in following the convention of replying to members of your lordships house rather than referring to bodies outside <e> <s> i believe that that is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not without notice <e> <s> for a moment i believed that there was an echo in the chamber <e> <s> my noble friend lady blatch and the noble lord lord carter brought up the subject of rural housing <e> <s> as my noble friend lord middleton said there is concern that local people should be able to buy homes in the area in which they reside and not be priced out of the market by others moving into the area <e> <s> people become worried when a shared owner in a rural area buys the whole of his property and then sells it on the open market <e> <s> it is lost to local people from the pool of low-cost housing <e>", "<cs> these two amendments would mean that local authority officers in the politically restricted group would be able no matter how senior their position to be members of parliament or of the european parliament and even more importantly could be adopted as candidates for those positions <e> <s> i say more importantly because it is likely that anyone elected to these posts as my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter pointed out would resign as a local authority officer as it would be difficult though not impossible to combine the two activities <e>", "<cs> these amendments would delete all the controls over public political activities other than the ban on membership of parliament the european parliament and principal councils and would limit that ban to chief executives chief officers their deputies and the monitoring officers <e> <s> this represents the furthest that the opposition are prepared to go in recognising that there is a problem in senior local government staff simultaneously undertaking their job as impartial servants of their local authorities and acting as partisan political activists <e>", "<cs> it will be helpful to consider together amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> they deal with the suggestion of a code of practice as an alternative to the bills proposals <e> <s> the effect of amendment no <e> <s> is to replace with a proposal for a code of conduct to be issued by the secretary of state the bills proposal that the terms of employment of officers holding politically restricted posts should incorporate restrictions on public political activity <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> would require consultation with a variety of representative associations about the code of conduct <e>", "<cs> a code of conduct is not something that we believe could usefully be added to the provisions <e> <s> what we believe we need are clear rules <e> <s> those are what clause will give us and those are what the noble lord lord jenkin was referring to <e> <s> a further code of conduct might however be useful if it came from the wishes of local government officers themselves <e> <s> however i have to say that to date there has been no initiative to produce one <e> <s> perhaps the amendment of the noble lord lord graham will provide a spur to those officers to produce one <e>", "<cs> i must make clear what i said <e> <s> i said that if a code were forthcoming it might i repeat the words to the noble lord lord graham be useful <e> <s> in the light of those circumstances if it were useful it could well make a useful supplement to the regulations themselves <e>", "<cs> the amendment has two features <e> <s> the first is very praiseworthy to make it clear that the governments proposals will not debar local authority staff even if they are in the politically restricted grades from worthwhile public activity in many different fields in which some form of public controversy is likely if not bound to arise <e> <s> voluntary bodies are active in many different fields and the government have no intention of trying to restrict the ability of local authority staff to play their role in their local community in any way as long as what they do does not undermine their impartiality in discharging the duties of their job <e> <s> in this the position is exactly parallel to that in the politically restricted grades in the civil service <e>", "<cs> there are just two small points that i wish to make <e> <s> i referred to activity rather than intention <e> <s> in fairness it is rather hard to expect the government to respond by referring to a registered charity which is not even mentioned in the amendment and expect them to take a position on it <e>", "<cs> the effect of amendment no <e> <s> is to require the secretary of state in framing the regulations under clause to have regard to the contents of any code of practice covering matters relevant to political activities by civil servants <e>", "<cs> i am completely unaware in my experience in government of the last suggestion made by the noble lord lord dean of beswick <e> <s> we are discussing the civil service because that is the object of the amendment that we are discussing <e>", "<cs> i hope that i shall not take up too much of the committees time <e> <s> i am well aware of the suggestion <e> <s> i refute it most strongly <e>", "<cs> first perhaps i may assure the noble lord lord graham that i never take lightly any matter which involves dogs having suffered at the jaws of a dog in a previous role a year ago <e> <s> i assure the noble lord lord graham that my facial grimace had nothing to do with irrelevance it had more to do with <e>", "<cs> remembrance <e> <s> the noble lord is entirely correct <e> <s> this amendment like amendments nos <e> <s> and would exempt anything done in a whole area of activity from the political restrictions even if it were directly aimed at an obviously party-political purpose <e> <s> this one would exempt anything done in the course of a campaign or activities which are not organised by a political party <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble lord lord graham will not be surprised that my answer to this amendment is very similar to the one i gave to the previous amendment <e> <s> once again with fear of repetition i must remind the committee of what i have already pointed out <e> <s> it is not the context in which something is done but what is done that we regard as relevant for deciding whether the restrictions under these clauses should apply <e> <s> i readily agree that it is difficult to think that anything done for or on behalf of a reputable professional association would be likely to be relevant to these prohibitions <e> <s> but it is not beyond the bounds of possibility <e>", "<cs> i can only repeat what i said in connection with the previous amendment <e>", "<cs> the amendment would require and enable the secretary of state to set up a new system of remuneration for councillors by regulation subject to three main criteria <e> <s> these are that it maintains and improves the opportunities for people to become councillors that it prevents undue financial hardship for councillors and finally that it reflects the importance to the community of the provision of local services <e> <s> the levels would be required to be uprated each year in line with inflation <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> would end the inclusion in the list of politically restricted posts of those who were listed by the authority as meeting the criteria in subsection <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> then removes consequentially the duty to prepare a list of the posts which meet the criteria in subsection <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is consequential upon amendment no <e> <s> which would retain the duty to prepare a list but remove the descriptions of posts to be included in it <e> <s> in effect it would leave the descriptions to be specified in regulations <e>", "<cs> this amendment would leave out the first of the criteria against which councils and the adjudicator are to judge whether a post is politically sensitive <e> <s> this criterion is whether the holder of the post regularly advises councillors <e> <s> we find it quite extraordinary to propose excluding this category <e>", "<cs> the amendment seeks to restrict the number of officers who will fall into the politically restricted category by virtue of the criterion which includes those who speak to the media for the authority <e> <s> it would restrict the criterion to those who carry management responsibility for such communication and give advice on representation matters <e>", "<cs> it is always a pleasure to find the noble lord lord graham of edmonton defending a government bill and helping it to emerge from this chamber unchanged <e>", "<cs> this new clause would limit the scope of the regulations defining the political restrictions which are to form part of the conditions of employment of officers in the politically restricted group to certain aspects <e> <s> these aspects are exactly for what the government intend to use the power <e> <s> i am happy to give an undertaking that we shall not be proposing any use of the regulation-making power outside the four corners of these items <e>", "<cs> the effect of these amendments is to substitute a panel of persons for the person appointed under clause to consider applications for exemption from political restriction <e> <s> the panel is to consist of three members an independent person who shall be the chairman a representative of local authorities and a person representative of trade unions with members affected or potentially affected by the political restrictions proposed under clause <e>", "<cs> we come back to an argument which we have covered several times today <e> <s> the noble lord lord graham likes to insinuate that the governments position is that these proposals are in every way similar to those of the civil service <e> <s> quite clearly this is a matter of horses for courses and we are talking about two different situations <e>", "<cs> i have to say to the noble lord lord mcintosh that i am skating on thin ice but i believe that he is correct in saying that it is otiose in which case we would have to look at the position before report stage <e> <s> i believe that is the case <e>", "<cs> it is my understanding that two points should be made <e> <s> first the noble lord lord mcintosh is correct in his summation of the situation concerning clause <e> <s> however i am also advised that i should draw the committees attention to the fact that when the noble lord moved his original amendment which has so affected clause he did so without informing the committee of the consequential effect of it <e> <s> i should put that on record <e> <s> however we accept his suggestion for the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the latter part of the noble baronesss question i refer her to the second part of my original answer <e> <s> each listed building consent decided by my right honourable friend is always has been and will continue to be determined on its individual merits <e> <s> the requirements of listed building consent legislation remain unchanged <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not too sure about my noble friends spiders <e> <s> however he is correct that we must strive constantly to achieve the right balance between preserving the past and allowing new development for the future to go ahead <e> <s> we must look forward as well as back <e> <s> that inevitably involves making judgments which will not be universally shared <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord jenkin <e> <s> i suppose that in less than a century someone else will have to stand at this dispatch box in order to explain why a further possible change may be taking place in poultry <e>", "<cs> my lords my brief does not go as far as taste <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend is aware that she has tabled a question on that subject which will be dealt with on monday <e> <s> i hope that i shall be able to answer it satisfactorily <e>", "<cs> my lords this matter was discussed at length at the inquiry <e> <s> i draw my noble friends attention to the inspectors report which goes into the matter at greater length and in greater technical detail than i am able to do this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the department will always try to avoid creating a state of confusion <e> <s> however i believe that english heritage has sent a circular to local authorities indicating its position on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble baroness would not expect me to become the minister for suggested demolition even though i have an office in marsham street <e> <s> however i listened with care and attention to what she said and will draw it to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> when i was very small my elders and betters always told me that i should be very careful about what i watched on television <e> <s> last night i was unable to have the benefit or the privilege of observing the panorama programme <e> <s> not having seen it i shall not comment apart from to say that this bill governs the whole of great britain rather than just westminster <e>", "<cs> the noble lord will see that clause a provides that it is the duty of every local authority <e>", "<cs> no but obviously it is more sensible to have one person in charge than a number <e> <s> the noble lord lord graham asked how the councillors will justify the expenditure <e> <s> we anticipate such expenditure to be a rare occurrence <e>", "<cs> we are not in any way trying to tell local authorities how they should be run <e> <s> we are merely trying to provide the tools to improve the management <e>", "<cs> this amendment would add a new item to the list of matters on which the head of the paid service is under a duty to report to the council where he considers it appropriate that is on the quality of the local authoritys services and their appropriateness in relation to the needs of the area concerned <e>", "<cs> i was not for one moment expecting to convince the noble lord <e> <s> however i believe we have reached the interesting position where on the previous amendment a great deal of discussion took place concerning the rights of elected members of an authority but the moment the government propose to provide rights for an elected authority to make decisions it is immediately considered unacceptable <e>", "<cs> in answer to the noble lord lord underhill the officer in question should if he is competent already be aware of the facts concerning those four points in subsection <e> <s> the difficulty is a straight difference of opinion concerning whether this should appear in the bill as the noble lord lord dean feels or whether such a review should be commissioned or requested by the elected members which is the governments view <e> <s> it is a straightforward difference of opinion and i fear that it will not be resolved this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord renton has spotted an obvious flaw in the amendment and the noble baroness lady david has discovered the cure <e> <s> the committee will agree that what she says makes sense <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord dean is of course correct because with regard to enforcement the monitoring officer is only part of the process <e> <s> when something has happened it is up to the party who feels aggrieved to take the matter to the courts <e> <s> after that the matter has nothing to do with the monitoring officer <e>", "<cs> the government propose that the monitoring officer will draw the councils attention to any illegality <e> <s> if the council persists it is for those concerned to pursue the matter before the courts <e>", "<cs> i hope very much that by the time i sit down i shall be able to answer the point on sensory handicaps raised by the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> the point is that if we include a provision saying that something does not apply when at first sight there could be no question of it applying then we raise the question of why it was necessary to say that <e> <s> and the answer will sometimes be that by a side-wind effect one has extended the scope of the original provision further than one intended <e> <s> that i believe could happen here <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble baroness <e> <s> i am not sure that i have the entire answer to her question <e> <s> however my understanding as regards sections and is that they are concerned with the registered disabled <e> <s> thus all those who are registered disabled are covered <e> <s> however i am not sure whether that satisfactorily covers her sensory point <e> <s> i should be grateful if the noble baroness will allow me to write to her on the sensory point <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendments conveniently form a package since they would make very similar alterations to clause which deals with requirements for standing orders affecting staff and to clause which deals with requirements for other standing orders <e>", "<cs> i have had to cover a familiar piece of ground again today <e> <s> noble lords opposite constantly refer to a television programme that was broadcast last night while i was here in the house <e> <s> i arrived at the department this morning and surprising though it may seem i have not had a chance to read a newspaper today <e> <s> the noble lord lord graham of edmonton then asked me a hypothetical question about what we shall do about allegations in a newspaper <e> <s> it is with the greatest sorrow and respect that i must tell him that it is physically and mentally quite impossible for me to provide an answer to his question much as i should like to do so <e>", "<cs> it is my recollection and i hope that i am not wrong that the noble lord lord graham supported the governments position when i responded last night to the noble baroness lady blatch <e> <s> i find the noble lords remarks rather confusing <e> <s> he is now taking a new line and presenting evidence in a different light <e>", "<cs> if the committee had been lucky enough to have had the attendance of the noble lord lord harris during its other sittings he would know that i have gone to a great deal of trouble from the very start of this bill in order not to reduce the debate to a low level slanging match about who said what or did what <e> <s> i have gone to a great deal of trouble to do that <e> <s> i had hoped that in a way we might have avoided going on to an area which i feel will be completely unproductive to the committee <e> <s> i should like to think that the noble lords lord graham and lord mcintosh are conscious of the effort that i have made in that direction and possibly appreciate it <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> proposes the deletion of the word proposed before the word appointment in clause c <e> <s> the effect of the amendment would be that the monitoring officer would be required to submit a report only on an appointment to a politically restricted post after the appointment had been made <e> <s> there would be no time limit by which the report was required <e>", "<cs> the effect of amendment no <e> <s> would be that a local authority with the agreement of all parties and after having obtained officer advice could opt out of the restrictions on the appointment of assistants to political groups and adopt such alternative local arrangements as they wish <e> <s> we believe that such matters as the number remuneration and allocation of such posts need to <e>", "<cs> i feel that once again i am rising somewhere in the middle as the voice of moderation <e>", "<cs> this amendment would give political groups in local councils a right of appeal to the secretary of state if they think that they have been treated unfairly over the arrangements for political advisers <e> <s> i think that i may fairly say that i was surprised when i saw that the noble lord lord ross of newport on the liberal bench had put down this amendment <e> <s> it would give the secretary of state wide and undefined powers to intervene in the internal affairs of a local authority if a political group believes that it is being treated unfairly <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is entirely correct <e> <s> i did not mention it because the next stage after that if there is still dissatisfaction is to go to law <e>", "<cs> if something illegal had occurred yes <e>", "<cs> clause restricts the information which is available to the public when exercising their rights at the time of audit to inspect the accounts of local authorities and certain other bodies <e> <s> only information about payments gross of any deductions made by an authority to each of its employees would remain open to inspection <e> <s> the clause provides that the information which is purely personal such as tax and national insurance deductions would not be open to inspection <e>", "<cs> the intention of the amendment is to guarantee that any political group which constitutes at least per cent <e> <s> of the authority is represented on any body comprised of five members or more and any political group which constitutes at least per cent <e> <s> of the authority is represented on any body comprised of members or more <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> this amendment seeks to extend the provisions of clause to enable the secretary of state to require officers who attend committees or are involved in any tendering process to provide information about their own pecuniary interests <e>", "<cs> this amendment would extend powers and enable the secretary of state to require members to disclose their non-pecuniary interests <e> <s> we considered very carefully in the context of the widdicombe report whether members should be required to register non-pecuniary interests <e> <s> such interests can be as important as pecuniary ones in influencing a members behaviour <e> <s> there is no question that where such an interest arises members should not vote or take part in proceedings <e> <s> however the existing criminal sanctions which apply in relation to disclosure of pecuniary interests at meetings do not apply to non-pecuniary interests <e> <s> that is because non-pecuniary interests are by their very nature difficult to define and it would be wrong in these circumstances to make disclosure subject to criminal sanctions <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that it will come as no surprise to the noble baroness when i tell her that i cannot prejudge the outcome of the planning application which is before southwark council <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that there would be an uproar if we started to interfere with the process especially with regard to local authorities <e> <s> indeed i am sure that i would be the first one to feel the wrath of your lordships house if i so suggested <e> <s> at present we cannot prejudge the outcome of the inquiry <e> <s> i should remind the house that the million scheme proposed by imry merchant is the largest contribution we have ever seen to a site such as that of the rose theatre <e>", "<cs> my lords i can do no more than heartily agree with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble baroness will not expect me to change government policy on my feet <e> <s> however perhaps i may point out to your lordships house that in fact the site is at present fully protected <e> <s> a great deal of work has already been done in this respect and an impermeable membrane now covers the whole of the site in order to provide adequate protection <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a most interesting suggestion <e> <s> however we are still some distance from being able to prepare the next stage as it were of the future of the rose theatre <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the application is to be heard at the next planning meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to write to the noble lord on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said i cannot prejudge the decision that will be taken by the southwark planners <e>", "<cs> my lords as always my noble friend lord bessborough has made a most interesting suggestion but i have to give him the answer that i gave earlier which is that it is probably a little too early to be able to act upon his idea but i shall draw it to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> this amendment would require the secretary of state to certify that any regulations made under clause requiring members to provide details of their pecuniary interests are no more onerous than those which are applicable to the members of either chamber in the houses of parliament <e> <s> that would indeed pose a major restriction on provisions as regards this chamber because as many members of the committee have pointed out members of this chamber are under no obligation whatsover to register their interests <e>", "<cs> it is always a great pleasure to have the company of the noble baroness lady serota in committee <e> <s> i stand here feeling a certain amount of awe and trepidation because as members of the committee will be aware the noble baroness was the chairman of the commission for local administration in england <e> <s> as a result i should have thought that there were few people in this country better versed as regards the matters contained in this part of the bill <e>", "<cs> the amendment would enable the local commissioners in england and wales to carry out investigations on their own initiative where they had reason to believe that a member of the public may have suffered injustice as a result of maladministration by an authority <e>", "<cs> this amendment deals with two separate issues <e> <s> with the leave of the committee i propose to deal with them separately <e> <s> subsection would provide for the commissions for local administration in england and wales to be funded directly by central government subject to consultation with the local authority associations <e>", "<cs> we believe the amendment of the noble lord lord mcintosh gives t he secretary of state as big a role to play as the governments own current clause does <e> <s> we believe it is well established that the funding arrangements proposed by the government will ensure that both central and local government as well as the commission itself will have a say <e> <s> it is this tripartite arrangement which we believe will go so far as is possible to ensure the independence of the commission <e> <s> that is why it is our preferred choice <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is entirely correct <e>", "<cs> the amendment would extend the ombudsmans jurisdiction to the investigation of commercial and contractual matters by requiring the secretary of state to repeal paragraph of schedule to the local government act which at present specifically excludes such matters from the ombudsmans purview <e> <s> the repeal would be made by order within three months of the date of the passing of this act <e>", "<cs> like the previous amendment amendment no <e> <s> seeks to extend the local ombudsmans jurisdiction in this case to the administration of schools and colleges within the ombudsmans purview <e>", "<cs> it would be some form of pilot scheme <e> <s> with my hand on my heart this is the first time this summer that i have been able to say what a great pleasure it is to have had the case supported by such an eminent figure as the noble baroness lady serota <e> <s> it is a very difficult area <e>", "<cs> under the new section a to be inserted in the act the form of declaration is to be described by order rather than by the election rules <e> <s> we have taken the point that the form of the declaration to be made within a period of two months after an election cannot appropriately be prescribed in the rules for the conduct of elections <e> <s> but as regards the terms of declaration that should be in the bill those terms have always been prescribed in subordinate legislation and we see no reason to change that <e>", "<cs> these amendments are intended to provide that the power for local authorities to incur expenditure in the promotion of economic development is placed on the statute book without any limitation <e> <s> the amendments effectively delete references to clause of the bill which would enable the secretary of state to make regulations to limit the scope of the very broad power given to local authorities under clause and clause which sets out the consultation procedures with the local business community <e>", "<cs> in the last set of amendments we discussed whether there should be any restrictions on the use of the economic development power <e> <s> this amendment and those that follow attempt to ensure that certain activities are included in the bill as pertinent to economic development by local authorities <e>", "<cs> amendment g is similar in intention to the previous one in that it would insert an extra category into the list of activities which can be regarded as financial assistance <e> <s> in this case it suggests providing subsidy in respect of remuneration of any employee <e> <s> in other words it proposes that wage subsidies be regarded as an element of fostering economic development <e>", "<cs> these amendments seek to remove the words and their powers by virtue of other enactments whenever they appear in this clause which establishes the restrictions to apply to economic development activity <e> <s> the effect would be that restrictions under this bill or regulations ensuing would apply only to economic development under the new power <e> <s> they would not apply to economic development activities funded through other powers <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord graham tends slightly to confuse the issue <e> <s> when i say that economic development has been welcomed it certainly has <e> <s> the noble lord does not like clauses and <e> <s> he

pleased to say that i think i can go a little further than the noble lord lord mcintosh who very kindly suggested that we should have a meeting <e> <s> the secretary of state has agreed to meet

individual application because there may well be groups <e> <s> therefore it is not correct to say that each application will be individual <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord graham has indicated the amendment is directed to a specific point in the consultation paper on <e>", "<cs> the amendment would remove subsection of clause <e> <s> that subsection provides that where two or more local authorities are involved with a company their interests should be aggregated for the purpose of deciding whether a company is subject to the control or influence of a local authority <e>", "<cs> this amendment would declare that where a scheme for grants to voluntary bodies has been established under section of the local government act the grants paid under that scheme are not to be regarded as done by each of the participating councils <e> <s> the concern which has given rise to this amendment would be reasonable if it actually existed <e> <s> however as i shall try to show the concern is non-existent and the amendment is therefore unnecessary <e>", "<cs> this new clause would exempt from the controls on companies subject to local authority control or influence all companies whose purposes include preserving public buildings and monuments or places of beauty or interest <e> <s> the amendment brings us back to the basic question which we have been debating for most of the afternoon <e> <s> this concerns which companies are to be regarded as so closely associated with local authorities that they should be controlled as part of the local authority sector <e>", "<cs> they

gone a considerable distance already this afternoon in the reply that i gave to him which is why the noble lord did not press his amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not willing to go further than i have already gone today <e> <s> i remind the noble lord that i pointed out to the noble lord lord graham that we would be prepared to consider the question of independence that can be demonstrated without the requirement for individual application <e>", "<cs> the passenger transport executives are part of the local authority sector and the rules should treat them accordingly <e> <s> it therefore follows that we need to consider the position of companies which are extensions of passenger transport executives in the same light as companies which are extensions of local authorities <e> <s> the ptes have the same potential to use companies to avoid controls to which they are subject as local authorities <e> <s> to ensure that there is therefore a comprehensive and logical pattern for the whole of the local authority sector it is necessary to bring within the system companies which are subject to the control or influence of ptes <e> <s> airport companies borrowing is controlled at the moment and that will remain the case <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> m would provide that expenditure would be expenditure for capital purposes if it would be so regarded under a generally recognised published code or any equivalent statement of accounting practices <e>", "<cs> these amendments would delete the word substantially in each of the three places where it occurs in subsection of clause <e> <s> the upshot of these amendments would be that expenditure on works could be capitalised if it lengthened the life of an asset but did not do so to a substantial degree or if it increased the value of an asset hut did not do so to a substantial degree also or increase the extent to which the asset could be used but again did not do so to a substantial degree <e>", "<cs> the amendment would delete the power of the secretary of state in the interests of prudent financial management to make regulations to regulate borrowing by local authorities <e> <s> the primary question raised by the amendment is not whether the government should have the power to regulate local authority borrowing in the interests of prudent financial management <e> <s> it is whether they should continue to have that power <e> <s> the secondary question is whether that power should be contained in a not very well-known act sponsored by the treasury or whether it should be contained in local government finance legislation alongside the other provisions dealing with local authority borrowing and capital finance <e>", "<cs> under the present legislation the function of borrowing must be exercised by the full council <e> <s> that function cannot be delegated to a committee or a sub-committee let alone to an officer <e> <s> i do not think that there is any dispute that this is quite unrealistic in present circumstances <e> <s> in practice the tactical decisions about borrowing are taken by officers <e> <s> what clause seeks to establish is a division of functions between the full council on the one hand and on the other committees sub-committees and officers which is sensible in present circumstances <e>", "<cs> the noble lords suggestion indicates that a local authority will have a vast amount of proportion and a single length of debt <e> <s> in per cent <e> <s> of local authorities debt was in short-term securities and that provided a great problem <e> <s> that situation has changed <e>

points that the noble lord has made <e> <s> i am very much aware of the importance of a stable background against which local authorities can plan their capital programmes <e> <s> that is why the

authority associations that if they consider that there is scope or need for development of the existing opportunities for consultation he would invite them to discuss this in the first instance with officials in the relevant service department <e>", "<cs> we are not offering consultation after decisions <e> <s> what is on offer is consultation before public expenditure survey decisions are taken <e> <s> i must emphasise that <e>", "<cs> the question of tolerance was aired in committee in another place <e> <s> in the existing capital control system there is what is known as per cent <e> <s> tolerance on capital allocations <e> <s> what was intended was that an authority should be able to spend per cent <e> <s> more than its allocation in any year <e> <s> but it would have to offset this against its allocation for either the previous or the following year <e> <s> i say was intended because due to a defect in the legislation it does not quite work like that <e> <s> authorities can in fact usually spend the per cent <e> <s> tolerance without suffering the offset <e> <s> so the effect of tolerance has simply been that we have to issue fewer allocations in the first place <e> <s> otherwise we would have a built-in overspend <e>", "<cs> let me say at the outset that the government understand the importance which local authorities attach to being able to determine their own priorities <e> <s> that is why the government have permitted capital allocations to be used for any service in the present capital control system and why we have distinguished between basic and supplementary credit approvals in the new system <e>", "<cs> if one wants to control grant-aided expenditure one has to exclude it from bcas as well as including it in the scas otherwise the authority could increase expenditure above its sca by using the bca <e> <s> i know that the noble lord lord mcintosh felt that the grant was insignificant but we disagree <e>", "<cs> the amendment attempts to provide that we should issue provisional basic credit approvals to local authorities for two years ahead and that we should give indications of the extent to which we intend to take account of receipts in future years <e>", "<cs> it is because we are making plans for total credit approvals on a three-year basis in public expenditure plans that we can offer these forward indications to local authorities <e> <s> however and here is the rub public expenditure plans are not statutory <e> <s> they include variables such as the annual capital guidelines which have no statutory basis <e>", "<cs> we stand by paragraph a <e> <s> we never said that the indications would be enshrined in statute <e> <s> that is what we said in that paragraph and it is what we say now <e>", "<cs> it is difficult when the noble lord lord mcintosh asks whether i will think about it again <e> <s> the noble lord has asked for examples of how the forward assurances would be given <e> <s> this is a matter which we are still considering and we shall be consulting local authorities <e> <s> it could be that we shall give local authorities an indication of a proportion of their basic credit approvals <e>

guidelines which would overcome this difficulty <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> zzb would delete subsection of clause <e> <s> this subsection provides that in determining the amount of credit approvals ministers may have regard subject to the provisions of this section to such factors as appear to be appropriate <e>", "<cs> like the noble lord lord graham of edmonton perhaps i may also

the types of disposal affected would be to a housing action trust under tenants choice or on a voluntary basis <e> <s> the disposal costs we are talking about could include those which are commonly called dowries the noble lord lord mcintosh pointed that out referring to payments an authority may have to make if the property sold has a negative value <e>", "<cs> this amendment would place a duty on the secretary of state when determining the basis for the payment of residual debt subsidy to ensure that there was no reduction in the total amount available for housing revenue account subsidy <e> <s> we do not as i said earlier intend rds to be payable as a separate subsidy under the new financial regime from next april when hra subsidy will be introduced <e> <s> instead any costs which could have been eligible for rds will instead be taken per cent <e> <s> into the calculation of hra subsidy without reducing the amount payable to other authorities <e>", "<cs> the answer to the noble lords question is yes <e>", "<cs> the effect of this amendment would be to remove the powers of the secretary of state to provide a safety net for authorities in which a transfer of housing took place to a housing action trust <e>", "<cs> that is not what i said about the mori poll <e> <s> i said that the departments policy would not be directed by a mori poll <e> <s> i am quite sure that if the noble lord lord graham were standing where i am standing now he would say exactly the same to me if i made a similar suggestion <e> <s> at this stage we cannot be more specific about the cost of hats next year because we are essentially in a transitory period <e> <s> because of that it would be very difficult to be specific concerning the sums of money that will be required or be available <e> <s> however unlike the noble lord lord graham we are confident that we shall see success in our policy and that is why we believe it is important that the money should be there to carry out the special and important tasks <e>", "<cs> there has been a tremendous investment in trying not to let them happen led in many ways by the benches opposite <e> <s> however my personal view and that of the department is that there will be a hat <e> <s> once one is seen and is seen to be a success many more will follow <e>", "<cs> in opening my remarks about amendment no <e> <s> xb i should make it clear that clause is concerned not with the recovery of subsidy resulting from mistakes by the secretary of state but with the recoupment of subsidy where the <e>", "<cs> clause contains general rules which will govern the making of directions and determinations by the secretary of state <e> <s> these direction-making powers are necessary since the definition of the ring fence and the operation of the subsidy system need to be set out in rules which are both detailed and flexible <e> <s> this is not possible if we rely on the statute book alone and indeed there is a long tradition of administrative instruments for rules of this kind <e> <s> that is why it is important that the secretary of state should have wide enough scope to make directions covering the very wide range of circumstances that may arise <e>", "<cs> under the provisions of clause where directions and determinations have a general application the secretary of state will be required to consult representatives of local authorities <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> xd would specifically identify the local authority associations as the bodies to be consulted <e> <s> i agree that there is a small change here from the words in the existing statute namely the housing act <e> <s> but there is nothing sinister about this <e> <s> the traditional formula if i might put it that way requires consultation with such associations of local authorities as appear to be concerned and with any individual local authority with whom consultation appears to be desirable <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may apologise and correct myself <e> <s> it was my error and the noble lord is entirely correct <e>", "<cs> the effect of the amendment would be to delete the existing requirement for the report which an authority must prepare before considering the declaration of a renewal area to contain details of the financial resources available or likely to be available to it to put into effect the proposed programme of work within that area <e> <s> it would <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord lord mcintosh will accept that the object of the bill is to provide the framework for this to happen <e> <s> as he is well aware the fact of the matter is that resources will be allocated in the public expenditure round each year and allocated to local authorities <e> <s> what we have here is the framework which allows the secretary of state to review cases in which he feels that there is a contribution that can be made by not one but two routes <e>", "<cs> the amendment would require the report which must be considered by local authorities before declaring a renewal area to contain information on an additional matter the proper and effective use of accommodation <e>", "<cs> the amendment would require the secretary of state to have regard to information on housing conditions in a particular area in issuing any guidance under clause <e> <s> i understand that its purpose is to ensure that the varying needs of individual areas are taken into account <e> <s> the amendment assumes that guidance will be directed at individual areas <e> <s> this is not our intention <e> <s> instead we propose that the guidance should be of general application and rather than addressing itself to detailed criteria such as those in clause should deal with the process of preparing the report which must be considered before declaration of an area <e>", "<cs> as we have heard the purpose of amendment no <e> <s> is to give local authorities a statutory duty to provide advisory services for people living in renewal areas <e>", "<cs> the effect of this amendment would be twofold <e> <s> first it would require the secretary of state to consult the local authority associations on the rate or rates of exchequer contribution which he is minded to determine in respect of expenditure incurred by local authorities under this part of the bill <e> <s> secondly it would set a minimum rate of contribution of per cent <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mcintosh is correct in that assumption <e>", "<cs> as i said earlier there will be an application of the test of resources which will be provided in clause or in the case of clause with regard to landlords there will be a test of resources on those two <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mcintosh predictably resists the concept of any form of testing <e> <s> it is also fair to say that if there was no test the net effect would be that quite a number of people living in luxury blocks of flats and enjoying a high standard of living would be able to get per cent <e> <s> grants to maintain their living conditions <e> <s> the outcome of that would be that any money that went to those better off people would in a world where resources are always finite leave less to go to those who are worse off which would hamper what we are trying to achieve <e>", "<cs> the effect of these amendments would mean that borrowing incurred by a local authority in order to finance a mandatory renovation grant to make a property fit for human habitation would not come within the controls provided by part iv of this bill <e> <s> specifically it would mean that an authority could borrow whatever it needed outside its basic credit approval to finance mandatory grant expenditure <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has pointed out it is a requirement of the existing grant legislation that an improvement grant cannot normally be approved unless the property concerned is likely to provide satisfactory housing accommodation for a period of years <e> <s> this requirement was first imposed in the housing act when its stated purpose was to ensure that grant aid was directed towards worthwhile improvements such as the provision of a bath <e> <s> in this may have been a very necessary requirement but i doubt whether it serves quite the same purpose now particularly with the introduction of the revised fitness standard <e> <s> indeed its effect has been to restrict grant availability for a number of sensible improvements <e>", "<cs> amendments nos <e> <s> and would oblige the secretary of state to specify the requirements as to what would constitute adequate thermal insulation and adequate facilities for space heating for the purposes of discretionary grants <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> za would go further and extend the requirement that a dwelling should have adequate provision for lighting heating and ventilation to be considered fit for human habitation to include adequate measures for conservation of heat <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may give a short answer to the noble earl lord russell <e> <s> i think that the government have determinedly shown in recent days that inflation still is a major target though it may be on a different route than through the energy algebra which the noble earl so deftly displayed to the committee <e>", "<cs> i can understand the noble lords fears that any limits set on individual grants will act as a disincentive <e> <s> i must say at the outset that we have at present no proposals to set any limit <e> <s> i must also say that i do not accept that the provisions of part viii do nothing to encourage people to undertake works at an early stage rather than postpone them <e> <s> the whole purpose of clause a is to make discretionary grant available for the kind of repairs that i am sure the noble lord has in mind <e> <s> where people genuinely cannot afford to carry out such works the new grant system will be of greater benefit than the existing one since grant of up to the full cost of the works will be available instead of grant at a percentage of a fixed rate as at present <e>", "<cs> whatever the merit of this proposal i think it would be wrong to give the secretary of state an order-making power of this sort where there could on the national home improvement councils admission be considerable public expenditure implications the magnitude of which i suspect the noble earl has underestimated <e>", "<cs> will the noble earl also be speaking to amendment no <e> <s> a which is grouped with the other three amendments <e>", "<cs> these four amendments would have the effect of reintroducing a specific grant towards the cost of thermal insulation and draught-proofing <e> <s> it would be available to both public and private tenants as well as owner occupiers <e> <s> the local authority would be required to give such grant <e>", "<cs> this amendment would require the secretary of state to contribute towards the cost of grants for energy efficiency measures at a rate of <e>", "<cs> i should first of all like to make it clear to the noble lords lord carter and lord graham of edmonton and others that the government have every sympathy with the intentions which lie behind this amendment <e> <s> it is the policy of her majestys government to exempt from the community charge everyone who is severely mentally impaired and we certainly have no wish to discriminate against certain groups of severely mentally impaired people <e>", "<cs> the amendment seeks to replace relief under the rating disabled persons act by a similar relief for disabled people who are subject to a community charge <e> <s> that subject has given rise to a good deal of misunderstanding and i hope to have an opportunity to set out the facts <e> <s> being disabled does not in itself entitle anyone to rate relief <e> <s> rate relief for disabled people applies only where as a result of the disability the individual has had alterations made to his or her home for example the installation of a downstairs bathroom <e> <s> ordinarily such alterations would count as improvements which would increase the rateable value of the property <e> <s> that would have the unfortunate effect of requiring a disabled person who had altered his or her home to pay higher rates for a similar property than a non-disabled person <e>", "<cs> this amendment concerns the information-gathering powers of community charge registration officers <e> <s> it would prevent a registration officer from requesting information from a non-resident landlord or his employee about his tenants or licensees <e>", "<cs> i clearly cannot give any specific undertaking but i shall of course be more than happy to receive such a letter as described by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may address two of the points that the noble lord lord ross of newport has brought to the committees attention <e> <s> first dealing with this part of the amendment in schedule with regard to the community charge was the wish of the opposition for the convenience i believe of the committee <e> <s> secondly with regard to the multiplier i can assure the noble lord lord ross of newport that it is two in both countries <e> <s> finally i know that he would like to see a higher multiplier but we addressed the deprivation which was drawn to the departments attention particularly that of single people who had to live on the premises of their employment and would then be open to a double charge in their own home <e> <s> that is why we felt that there was a case of true and genuine deprivation <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the silence does not mean tacit acceptance but it is golden <e> <s> i think it is fair to say there is an interesting dilemma here which has been raised by all members of the committee who have spoken that is those who are losers are upset and those who are winners do not feel they have had a good enough deal <e> <s> there is an interesting reverse with those paying the community charge in the south having to assist the boroughs that are less well off in the inner cities as compared with the situation of the ubr being reduced in the north and rising in the south overall <e>", "<cs> my lords in terms of showing its commitment to meeting the regulations within europe this country is the only member state with a comprehensive committed and funded programme to bring all of its drinking water up to the directive standards <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is referring to th september the action will be against the government <e> <s> a very good question is raised by the noble lord <e> <s> there is a certain amount of uncertainty as to the powers of the commission once an action has achieved a result one way or another <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a slightly grey area <e> <s> however i believe the answer at the moment to the question raised by the noble lord is no <e>", "<cs> my lords if we are going to have standards on a european-wide basis and i believe that most people in this country and i hope in europe desire that we have to have regulations and they have to be on a european basis otherwise they will be meaningless <e>", "<cs> my lords

transitional arrangements for the introduction of the community charge <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords the one thing of which i can assure your lordships house is that coming to this chamber this afternoon for this statement has nothing to do with electoral advantage <e> <s> we always recognised that the introduction of the community charge would mean that some households would gain and others lose and that the area safety net will reduce difficulties for areas which have to raise more than they raised in total from their residents previously <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the remarks of my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> if the entire sum had gone through to low spending authorities the sum of money involved would have been some million <e> <s> we

state for scotland <e> <s> towards the end of my statement i clearly said that the secretary of state for scotland and the secretary of state for wales will be making announcements separately about

conduct a flexible policy and that what i have stated this afternoon shows flexibility <e>", "<cs> my lords i could go into this at some length <e> <s> perhaps i may suggest to the noble lord that in the library there is a copy of the statement with some illustrative examples of different effects <e> <s> he will probably find them very helpful <e> <s> of course there are very different situations

basis will be that a community charge demand will be sent out <e> <s> then those who wish the new regulations that will come out of what i have said today to apply to them will be able to take advantage of the scheme that we have proffered today <e>", "<cs> my lords at this moment i cannot go beyond what i said at the end of the statement <e> <s> the secretary of state for scotland and the secretary of state for wales will be making separate statements <e>", "<cs> my lords in scotland and wales there are special considerations <e> <s> that is why the secretaries of scotland and wales

the amendment does not limit itself to primary legislation <e> <s> it would require the secretary of state to consult before taking any action which would affect the levels of charges <e> <s> i submit that it would be almost impossible for any secretary of state to comply with such a requirement and there would be scope for great argument both before and after the event whether a particular action

provisions in the rent act <e> <s> that is why we cannot accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> this amendment concerns a landlords power to determine a fixed term assured tenancy before the expiry of the fixed term <e> <s> i believe that noble lords are concerned that since under section a power to determine does not include a reference to a power of re-entry or forfeiture the landlord cannot exercise the power of re-entry or forfeiture under section of the act <e>", "<cs> this amendment is directed at section of the housing act which establishes the statutory procedure for increasing the rent under an assured periodic tenancy <e> <s> as it stands the procedure involving a right of access to the rent assessment committee applies to assured periodic tenancies other than those for which there is provision in the tenancy agreement itself for increasing the rent <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are well aware of the problems of those who are suffering from higher mortgage interest payments <e> <s> however they are also aware that to preserve the strength of the economy we must control inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of that <e> <s> the comment of my noble friend is entirely true and correct <e>", "<cs> my lords it is probably wise to remind your lordships house that on four previous occasions since between november and december december and march october and march and march and august mortgage rates were above per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may return partially to my previous answer <e> <s> the experience of over years ago resulted in the building societies doing exactly what my noble friend has pointed out <e> <s> the building societies are very accommodating on this point <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are dedicated quite rightly to controlling inflation <e> <s> occasionally that has resulted in interest rates having to rise <e> <s> that is a different proposition from what was proposed by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords it is probably fair to say that those who were the lenders months ago felt that they were getting the short straw <e>", "<cs> my lords often an inheritance is beneficial <e> <s> on that occasion it was problematical <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel it would be appropriate but i cannot reply on behalf of my noble friend <e> <s> i understand her concern about the proper conduct of local government <e> <s> however we do not believe that we should be moving to restrict the activities of local authority officers more than is absolutely necessary <e> <s> thus we do not support the case which my noble friend has put before the house <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may preface my remarks by returning the thanks given by the noble lord lord mcintosh at the commencement of his remarks with regard to the discussions that we have held over the past two weeks <e> <s> they are fully reciprocated by me <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of the amendment is to require the secretary of state before issuing any regulations under clause of the bill in respect of assistants to political groups to consult such organisations representative of local authorities and employees as appear to him to be concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can safely say that here as so often your lordships house has been able to play the proper role of a revising chamber <e> <s> when this bill came from another place there was deep disagreement between the main parties about the provisions in clauses to <e> <s> we now have a fair degree of agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment would further restrict the definition of those who are to count as a deputy chief officer by requiring not only as the bill does that they report regularly to a chief officer but also that they deputise from time to time for the chief officer and also that they are graded at an equivalent level to such a deputy <e> <s> the noble lord lord graham occasionally complains that the government do not know enough about how local authorities work <e> <s> i have to say that i fear that this amendment does not make enough allowance for the diversity of organisation among local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment would extend the exemption from political restrictions for teachers and lecturers to include non-academic staff in schools and colleges unless they are involved on a regular basis in giving advice to the authority <e> <s> i think that the amendment does not pay enough attention to the other amendments that we have considered and are going to consider <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment would exclude decisions in connection with clause of the bill from the duty of the monitoring officer to prepare a report under clause <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment would link permanently the maximum pay for assistants to political groups to the dividing line in the system of political restrictions <e> <s> we do not believe that that is the right approach <e> <s> there may be arguments at some future date for the maximum pay of political assistants to be higher or even lower than the dividing salary point in the restriction system <e> <s> the amendment would prevent that <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of the amendment would be that any person holding a post at the date of royal assent whose duties would otherwise fall within clause would not be caught by the restrictions on assistants to political groups <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it if that person left the post and went back into the mainstream so to speak he would be subject to the rules in clauses to <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord lord graham of edmonton <e> <s> now that he has put his question a second time i think that i understand it <e> <s> i believe i am correct in saying that once it becomes a new post a post-royal assent post it will have to fit in with the new rules with regard to the authoritys power as contained in clause <e> <s> the assurance that i give this evening

sure that your lordships house is grateful for the concise exposition given by the noble lord lord mcintosh of the transformation which has occurred in local government from a basis of no recompense to where we are today and where we hope to go tomorrow <e> <s> it was far better than any other exposition i have received on its history <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that a cheque will have to be forthcoming from the department of the environment <e> <s> the sum will not be index-linked but will be reviewed on a regular basis by the secretary of state <e> <s> on the point made by the noble lord lord mcintosh with regard to the financial loss allowance as i pointed out in my original statement we shall keep that for those on the authority who are appointed members <e> <s> we considered that carefully <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mcintosh pointed out it involved very few people and we felt that it would overcomplicate the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not misunderstand the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> i was merely indicating that there was still an element of the financial loss allowance although it applied to separate criteria <e>", "<cs> my lords as always the point of the noble lord lord graham is interesting even if it somewhat broadens the argument <e> <s> i felt from the earlier remarks of the noble lord lord mcintosh that in many areas it was accepted that the government are trying to find an acceptable answer to the problem <e> <s> i am sure that there will be occasions when noble lords on the benches opposite disagree <e>", "<cs> my lords on the basis of that modified rapture i shall return to my seat <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i am correct in saying that it has been discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment attempts to make it clear on the face of the bill that the functions of a local authority in relation to promoting the economic development of its area under clause cannot be limited by any restriction based on geographical factors <e> <s> the amendment fails to recognise the scope of the new power and the way in which the government have stated that any geographical restrictions imposed under clause are to be applied <e> <s> i think that i could assist your lordships therefore by making some important general points to clarify the scope of the new power <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a pleasure when the noble lord lord graham feels that the government have taken some steps no matter how uncertain <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> relates to the figure which may be specified in regulations and above which level only certain authorities will have the power to provide financial assistance <e> <s> on an earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not believe that amendment no <e> <s> is necessary <e> <s> the secretary of state will have the power to vary any restrictions which he may prescribe in regulations <e> <s> the position will be reviewed from time to time and i am sure that authorities will be quick to make representations to the department if they think there are circumstances that warrant special arrangements <e> <s> for example there could be circumstances where because of the closure of a large firm in an otherwise relatively stable local economy a local authority wishes to take some urgent action which would otherwise be subject to restrictions under the power <e> <s> the flexibility to deal quickly with such circumstances is already available under the bill as drafted <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that this amendment would run contrary to our basic philosophy about wage subsidies to commercial undertakings being provided by local authorities <e> <s> it may assist your lordships if i set out the governments reasons for wishing to place restrictions on wage subsidies <e>", "<cs> this matter as the noble lord lord graham pointed out was raised in committee and i am in the happy position of being able to tell the noble lord lord graham that there is nothing between us on this issue though we believe that the amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> the example was quoted of a local authority finding itself faced with a problem in the local economy that did not exist when the authority drew up its economic development programme at the beginning of the financial year <e> <s> there might for example be a sudden closure of a large manufacturing plant which has played a vital role in the local economy <e> <s> the local authority could not have predicted such an event and their years programme for expenditure under this power may therefore be inappropriate to deal with the problems arising from the closure <e> <s> the authority may need to support retraining or relocation of staff or redevelopment of the vacant premises none of which had been mooted in their economic development programme <e> <s> there is nothing in clause which would prevent a local authority expanding or redirecting its expenditure under the economic development power from that originally agreed at the beginning of a financial year <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment attempts to answer a concern which i believe has mistakenly arisen as a result of the amendments which clause makes to local auhorities discretionary spending power under section of the local government act <e> <s> clause proposes a number of minor changes to section to help clarify the scope of the power <e> <s> section already requires any expenditure under it to be in the interests of the area of the local authority or any part of it or all or some of its inhabitants <e> <s> it is the change to this requirement to ensure that direct benefit must accrue to the area or any part of it or all or some of its inhabitants that is giving rise to concern here in relation to local authorities overseas town twinning

power <e> <s> the noble lord raised this question in committee <e> <s> i realise that his new amendment meets some of the criticisms i raised against the earlier proposals <e> <s> it is true that the bill will change its expenditure limit under section from a limit based on rateable value to a limit based on population <e>", "<cs> my lords i was giving the overall picture because i think it is important that the house should have the chance to know what the situation is across the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords sometimes after listening to the blandishments of the noble lord lord mcintosh i wonder how i can get myself back to marsham street the following morning <e> <s> i seem to find that a good nights sleep restores my faith in the system <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment standing in the names of the noble lords lord hayter lord ross of newport and lord mcintosh of haringey would raise the level of grant below which a local authority is not required to insist on a report from a voluntary association on how the grant was used <e> <s> the level would be raised from to <e> <s> having heard the arguments of the noble lord lord hayter i am happy to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendments would exempt from the provisions of part v all housing associations within the meaning of section of the housing associations act and bodies established by such associations for the purposes mentioned in section e of that act that is providing repair and improvement services <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> b would apply all references in part v to a company to all companies whether or not they were exempted by a direction under clause <e>

am not the secretary of state <e> <s> as i have explained the case would be examined on its merits <e>", "<cs> the purpose of the three amendments is to place a requirement that any orders made by the secretary of state are made in accordance with published criteria <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment as the noble baroness lady david clearly drew to your lordships attention is aimed at the position of companies such as those which provide inter-lending and similar services for library authorities in london and the south-east <e> <s> the problems which have been laid before the house by the noble baroness pose an interesting and difficult question <e> <s> part of the purpose of the proposals in part v of the bill and of the complementary proposals in part iv is to ensure that the same rules apply to the capital finance raised by local authorities whether they raise it directly themselves or through the intermediary of a company <e> <s> as part of their general economic policy the government think that the highest importance must be attached to the control of demands for capital in the public sector of the economy <e>", "<cs> my lords my arguments were slightly broader than the noble lord lord graham has indicated <e> <s> i have to say that his premise rests on the fact that there are no other cases <e> <s> it has to be faced whether we like it or not that if such an exemption were granted there would be every reason as i stated clearly to invite others to feel that they too could follow that route <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord mcintosh for moving the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment would exclude voluntary organisations as defined in the amendment from the scope of the controls on companies influenced by local authorities <e> <s> i shall shortly be suggesting how the government have come some way to meet the concerns which have been expressed <e> <s> i am rather worried that the noble lord lord mcintosh may be devaluing the currency of concessions in the light of his last remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment would require an order under clause to require an authority to use its powers of control over a controlled company to ensure that a local ombudsman gets the information he needs <e> <s> the amendment brings us to the role of the commissioner for local administration the local ombudsman in relation to companies under the control of the local authority <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i think that i can go most of the way with the noble lord <e> <s> i said that the government see strong arguments in favour of it <e> <s> that must be considered as indicative <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment would prevent the secretary of state introducing an order to give effect to one of the proposed rules for local authority controlled companies before the completion of consultation with local government <e> <s> this is the rule requiring local authorities to use their powers of control to prevent companies which they control issuing party political publicity or otherwise seeking party political advantage <e>", "<cs> my lords our case is that if we are to have a strong set of rules for the local authority sector they must be comprehensive <e> <s> that is why they are comprehensive <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment would permit an order under clause to include provisions to ensure that companies controlled or influenced by local authorities pursue policies aimed at fair wages equal opportunities and the promotion of health and safety <e> <s> the amendment is unneccessary because if there were a case for making provisions under clause for any of those purposes the power in the clause is already wide enough to cover them <e> <s> to include specific provision on those three topics only would cast doubt on the width of the power <e> <s> more importantly however the amendment is misconceived <e> <s> it is our intention to ensure that companies that are properly regarded as part of the local authority sector are where appropriate subject to the same rules as local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment relates to the power under clause whereby the secretary of state may make an order placing requirements on local authorities in relation to companies that they control or influence <e> <s> the amendment states that any such order should not apply the restrictions on political activities set out in clause in the case of employees of local authority controlled companies <e> <s> similarly it states that any such order should not have the effect on employees of local authority influenced companies of being regarded as holders of politically restricted posts within the meaning of part i of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords an example would be the nec in birmingham <e> <s> i do not have a comprehensive list to hand <e> <s> however i propose to write to the noble lord lord dean giving him a substantial list of both types of companies as he has requested <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment would prohibit any order under clause requiring a company to be a registered charity as a condition for being treated as independent <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment again takes us back to the discussion of the amendment of the noble lord lord hayter <e> <s> in that amendment there was provision for recognising the independence of companies from local authorities on the basis of certain criteria <e> <s> one of those was a declaration by the company that it was managed independently of the local authority <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of the amendment is to ensure that no order can be made under clause in relation to a law centre <e> <s> it effectively provides a complete exemption for all law centres <e> <s> the amendment is clearly intended to ensure that the important work carried out by law centres is not adversely affected by the proposals in part v of the bill <e> <s> i am not sure however why they have been singled out in that way since there are numerous other advice agencies offering similar services <e>", "<cs> my lords the difference is that with citizens advice bureaux we were dealing with a national association which was why we were able to take the line that we did <e> <s> i am sure that the same would be possible if there were a national association of law centres <e> <s> the point touched upon by the noble lord lord mcintosh is that they vary in many small ways <e> <s> that is why i am not in a position to be able to say what i said in relation to cabs <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot help the noble lord lord mcintosh in the way that he wants <e> <s> the advantage of having a national association or federation is that it can provide the imprimatur if i may put it like that <e> <s> the noble lord asks me to say that we will change the basis <e> <s> we looked at the <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment brings us to the question of the companies in which it is proper for a local authority to be involved as the holder of a minority interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i should just like to give my heartfelt thanks to the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> i commend this amendment to your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords in the broad overview we very much welcome these amendments <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord mcintosh for writing to me about what he rightly describes as a particularly complex area in which he requires clarification <e> <s> i believe that he has seen the first part of my reply and i feel he has the certain knowledge that my door is always open in order to provide further exemplification if that is required <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord mcintosh has said we do indeed now move to a complex part of the bill <e> <s> it is so complex that i had to inspect three separate alternative possible answers to the noble lords question when reviewing the matter over the weekend <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments cover issues which we discussed in committee and which were also considered extensively in another place <e> <s> let me deal first with amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> it is hard to disagree with the noble lord lord mcintosh and my noble friend lady blatch and we do not disagree that we have emphasised the importance of stability and forward planning in the system <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear i am not going to be able to satisfy the requirements of the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> he will expect me to say that we are trying to achieve the impossible <e> <s> i deny that and i really feel i can do no better than remind him of the remarks that i made earlier <e> <s> he knows what they are and he disagrees he will not thank me for repeating them to him <e>", "<cs> my lords we have considered this matter further since it was raised in committee <e> <s> the noble lord lord graham might like me to respond first by saying what we propose to do <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of a statutory requirement for consultation with the local authority associations has been aired at many stages during the passage of this bill both in your lordships house and in another place <e> <s> i do not propose to go over all the same ground again in detail as i think the governments views are well known <e> <s> however the arguments against a requirement that there should be statutory consultation on a formula in respect of the criteria for issuing credit approvals highlight our case <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully understand what the noble lord is saying <e> <s> the difficulty is that he makes the assumption that the formula will be there in order to be discussed in front of both houses of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords the intention of the amendment is to ensure that local authorities should be able to credit the interest on housing revenue account cash balances to the housing revenue account <e> <s> that is the practice of many local authorities at present if not all of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord i shall shift down a gear <e>", "<cs> my lords as is so often the case my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter has already said it all for me <e> <s> part vi of the bill grants the secretary of state a range of powers to make directions and determinations to fill in the details of the new system <e> <s> noble lords opposite and their colleagues in another place have expressed some disquiet about this <e> <s> but the fact is that what we are doing is not new <e> <s> the new powers will simply replace powers granted by the housing act which consolidates earlier acts of and <e> <s> in all these statutes it has been accepted that detailed rules for keeping the housing revenue account and for calculating subsidy should be made by directions and determinations <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of this amendment is to preserve the effects of residual debt subsidy beyond st march and to extend its benefits to all local authorities <e> <s> in committee i felt that there was still some misunderstanding of this subject so i am glad of the opportunity to clear up the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the provision applies to all local authorities as i said earlier whether or not they fall within the scope of the residual debt subsidy <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord dean has given an extensive disquisition of the case as he sees it <e> <s> this amendment would add tenants representatives to the list of people whom the secretary of state must consult before he makes any directions or determinations under the powers contained in this part of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of this amendment would be to remove the secretary of states power to specify by directions the minimum number of dwellings which should be contained within a renewal area <e> <s> i should like to explain why the government would resist such an amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords that is exactly what i said <e> <s> we want to establish a policy <e> <s> if i may put it in these words we believe that a critical mass occurs and that is about where it is <e> <s> but there are liable to be special occasions <e> <s> that is why the criteria under clause allow that to happen <e>", "<cs> my lords the intention behind these two amendments is to allow disabled facilities grant to be paid in respect of adaptations carried out during the construction of a dwelling whether in the public sector or in the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords the effects of amendments nos <e> <s> and would be to ensure that all disabled facilities grants together with all renovation grants awarded to applicants whose household contained a disabled person should be given at per cent <e> <s> irrespective of the cost of the works or the resources of the applicant <e> <s> amendment noa of the noble lord lord mcintosh has the same effect in relation to disabled facilities grant but not to renovation grants <e> <s> to that extent it is less widely drawn <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i must take issue on one point that the noble baroness drew to your lordships attention <e> <s> i do not believe that this provision applies only to people who drink or gamble <e> <s> i must not accept that suggestion <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of means testing is not to save money for the exchequer <e> <s> it is to provide greater resources for those who are worse off in the community <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord seebohm has explained amendments nos <e> <s> and seek to introduce a provision which would exempt those over years of age or any other category of person defined by the secretary of state from the test of resources <e> <s> this would mean in practice that were such persons to apply for a grant and an authority were mindful of approving their application the grant would be available towards the full costs of the work irrespective of the resources they had available to meet some or all of the costs <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have been persuaded and accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords again the government have been persuaded and accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords for the third time the government have been persuaded and i accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that we attach great importance to energy efficiency measures both in the home and in the wider environment <e> <s> that is why a disabled person can receive assistance under the provisions in clause on a discretionary basis <e> <s> they can also receive help under clauses and as indeed can able-bodied applicants <e> <s> in each case these grants are discretionary rather than mandatory <e> <s> that is because we wish to encourage wherever possible insulation work to be carried out alongside other repair or improvement work rather than in isolation <e> <s> we wish to get away from the notion of help being exclusively focused on single items of work <e> <s> this is as true in the case of disabled facilities grant as for renovation grants generally <e>", "<cs> my lords as i passed through this little part of my ensemble i was thinking of the noble lord lord mcintosh and the next amendment <e> <s> i have no doubt that we shall have the opportunity momentarily in your lordships house to proceed to the very point that i have no doubt he will make <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i spoke to this amendment some time ago with amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> my lords i tried to set out the reasons earlier <e> <s> the most pressing one concerns the position of a local authority when a property that has been adapted for the special needs of a disabled person can no longer be occupied by that person on completion <e> <s> the problem arises over the position of the authority with regard to having given a grant <e>", "<cs> my lords that would be in the case of a private house for which i do not think there would be such a thing as a waiting list <e>", "<cs> my lords in the case of amendment no <e> <s> b we were discussing the disabled rather than the elderly <e>", "<cs> my lords sometimes i think that we would be better off working with a quill <e>", "<cs> my lords sure enough moments later we came to the suggestion of the noble lord lord mcintosh which would have been the answer to the problems in the previous amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will bear with me for a short time he will find that i shall explain why we believe we know what the figure will be <e> <s> concern has been expressed about the level of demand under the new system for mandatory grants in particular and the difficulties that this might pose for authorities budgeting <e> <s> i should like to explain in detail why i believe these fears may be exaggerated <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall tread carefully in order to get the procedural part correct <e> <s> it may help the house if i intervene at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord pointed out a similar amendment was moved by the noble lord lord graham in committee <e> <s> the amendment concerns the ability of a community charge registration officer to obtain information from corporate bodies on those people who are tenants or who sub-lease accommodation from that corporate body <e> <s> regulation of the community charge administration and enforcement regulations allows community charge registration officers to designate only individuals aged or over not corporate bodies as being responsible for providing information in respect of such properties <e> <s> consequently the effect of this amendment would be to prevent community charge registration officers receiving any such information from corporate bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that it will be receiving a reply <e> <s> it will be based on the answer i have given this afternoon to the noble lords amendment <e> <s> we believe that the protection in the bill is satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords i must congratulate my noble friend lord stanley and other noble lords and right reverend prelates on the persistence with which they have all returned to this important subject of low cost housing in rural areas <e> <s> i welcome the opportunity to restate the governments position because it is clear that there was a considerable misunderstanding of what was being proposed when we considered the issue in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to upset the box protection society and damage her majestys property <e> <s> i answered my noble friends question by saying that we have a period of consultation which is being run by the housing corporation which of course has a point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that i referred to the president rather than to an officer <e> <s> however it is fair to say that the noble viscount would not expect me to speculate until presented with hard and firm evidence <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord lord graham that i still have eyes in my head <e> <s> in in your lordships house the noble baroness lady david successfully moved an amendment to the housing and planning bill taking away the jurisdiction of the secretary of state <e> <s> the reason given was that the secretary of state had taken too severe a view of what constituted housing particularly suitable for elderly people <e> <s> how ought the secretary of state to deal with applications for determinations in the future if these amendments were accepted <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may return to the remarks made by the noble baroness at the committee stage of this bill <e> <s> she said that we were not to be led in this house by any cries of fairness <e> <s> as long as it is my honour to stand at this dispatch box for this government we support the cause of fairness for the elderly who wish to have the same rights as everybody else <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may interrupt my noble friend because it may help the house <e> <s> the effect of the amendment which has just been carried as i understand it is to restore to the secretary of state the task of deciding whether or not individual houses or flats should be excluded from the right to buy <e> <s> that will be the case in all parts of england and wales <e> <s> the present amendment would restore that jurisdiction to certain rural areas only <e> <s> that appears to be subsumed within the amendments of the noble lord lord mcintosh which have just been carried <e> <s> for that reason i feel that it would probably be more suitable for my noble friend to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly do not agree with the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> every list of groupings that i have seen today differs from the presentation which he has just given to suggest that the amendment we are now on and the amendment that follows it should be included in the decision on the previous amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of the amendment would be to prevent her majestys government from making determinations which could allow different provision to be made to cater more closely to differing needs of authorities because of say size or location <e> <s> i do not think that that would make much sense <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with the greatest of pleasure that i accept the noble lords amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure it is always good for the erudition of your lordships house to have a contribution from the noble lord lord monson <e> <s> one matter that i do remember about the leasehold reform act is that even the late dick crossman was rather shocked by the probity of it <e> <s> i recall that fact from reading his diaries this summer for the second time <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment seeks to ensure that existing long residential tenants and their spouses would retain their entitlement to a rent act tenancy under part i of the landlord and tenant act irrespective of the date on which the long tenancy was brought to an end <e> <s> if they assigned their tenancy after clause came into effect the new tenant would be subject to the th january cut-off date for such an entitlement <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that if i shot myself in one foot then i might have to shoot myself in the other <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend has said the amendment relates to the form of the notice that the landlord must serve if he wants to secure possession of the dwellinghouse when the long tenancy comes to an end <e> <s> under paragraph b the notice must state the ground or grounds on which he proposes to apply to the courts for possession <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend has said the amendment relates to paragraph of schedule which deals with new tenancies at a low rent granted to the same tenant on the ending of a long tenancy at a low rent <e> <s> in essence paragraph is aimed at ensuring that such tenants do not lose the protection afforded by the schedule if they take on such new tenancies <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i am correct in saying that my noble friend also spoke to amendments nos <e> <s> c and d <e> <s> these amendments relate to paragraph of schedule which disapplies the schedule in cases where the landlord and tenant agree to the grant of a new tenancy which is not at a low rent <e> <s> if the parties agree such a tenancy they obviously do not need to invoke the provisions of the schedule aimed at establishing one <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking with the leave of the house notice would have to be served before the assured tenancy is created as i understand it <e>", "<cs> my lords where there is a secure tenancy and the landlord has obtained an order for possession which has been suspended on certain conditions the tenancy comes to an end on the day when the tenant first commits a breach of the conditions <e> <s> the effect of the amendment would be to cause a secure tenancy to end on the date of execution of the order for possession <e> <s> so the tenant would retain for a longer period the rights and obligations which a secure tenancy implies such as the right to buy and the right to vote in any ballot about a voluntary transfer of housing stock from a local council to some other landlord <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ross tabled a similar amendment during committee <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment would provide for a dispute between two or more spouses over succession to a secure tenancy to be settled by the courts <e> <s> i am not aware that there have been disputes over successions to secure tenancies <e> <s> it is not an issue that has been raised with us by local authority associations <e> <s> i can see that the courts would be the natural forum to settle disputes but i cannot see in practice that we shall need to give them this extra duty <e> <s> i am of course prepared to look at any evidence of problems that the noble lord may care to send me <e> <s> but i am afraid that at the moment i cannot accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment is identical to one moved in committee by the noble lord lord mcintosh about which i subsequently wrote to him <e> <s> as i explained in committee a tenant exercising the right to buy is allowed discount only to the extent that it does not reduce the purchase price below the sum of the costs incurred by the landlord in acquiring building or improving the property <e> <s> these costs can be summarised to use the words of the amendment as <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of amendment no <e> <s> c would be that a person living with another person as wife or husband would be treated as the spouse <e> <s> we have no reason to believe that the redefinition within amendment no <e> <s> c is necessary or desirable <e> <s> we are not aware that problems have arisen in this connection <e> <s> however if the noble lord would like to send me details of cases i shall be happy to look into them although i cannot guarantee that we shall be able to do anything about it in this bill <e> <s> in the light of that explanation i hope that the noble lord will be able to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord raises a number of points in his supplementary question <e> <s> the basic position is that the royal parks are there for the enjoyment of the public

restaurant has proved to be expensive and will be replaced <e> <s> however i can assure your lordships house that the department will look to the assistance of the royal fine art commission for advice

might receive illumination on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords yet again i pay the price for not having a classical education <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble lord is well aware that much as the department may wish to control questions concerning pelicans they are completely outside our control <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to pay tribute to the quality of the speeches today in your lordships house and to emphasise the value that the government place on debates such as these <e> <s> i can assure noble lords that the government will carefully consider the points that have been made about this proposed directive <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of these amendments would be to give the adjudicator to be appointed under clause power to direct in certain cases that a post should not be regarded as that of a deputy chief officer <e> <s> he would consider whether certain posts which came within the definition of a deputy chief officer in clause should nevertheless be excluded because in practice they were not senior enough for the holders to be regarded as such <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of amendment no <e> <s> is to enable those categorised as politically restricted under clause of the bill to continue to engage in public political activity until such time as the adjudicator has ruled on the admissibility or otherwise of the application for exemption <e>", "<cs> my lords that is entirely correct <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of the amendment would be to amend the description of what an authoritys monitoring officer can be required to prepare in respect of proposed appointments <e> <s> instead of simply preparing a report he or she would have to prepare a clearance report <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments would make small but nevertheless important changes to clause which your lordships included on report to enable the secretary of state to set up a new system of councillors allowances <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> deals with the payment of the financial loss allowance to councillors <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments would allow local authorities to make local provision for standing orders instead of complying with the requirements of any regulations made under clause provided they do so by resolution with agreement of all parties and give notice of such resolution to the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment proposes that where restrictions on the use of the new economic development power apply on a geographical basis the regulations should make provision for local exemptions in areas where the unemployment rate is above a standard specified level <e> <s> the amendment is clearly directed at ensuring that black spots in an area which otherwise has a fairly buoyant local economy will be eligible for the full range of economic help from the local authority <e> <s> i believe that this is a problem which is more apparent than real <e> <s> i shall explain why <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment would require the secretary of state to exempt from the controls a company which is predominantly designed to help local authorities co-operate in discharging statutory duties

obligation on the secretary of state to make a direction under subsection of clause within three months of royal assent of this bill in respect of all advice centres whether or not such services form

which satisfy the tests for an influenced company if he is satisfied that the company carries out its activities independently of local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of this amendment would be to remove the secretary of <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no will require the secretary of state in making regulations under clause to provide for a test of resources which takes into account

benefit of the noble lord lord graham the time refers to the decade and not to my age though i may already be beginning to look it <e> <s> however i shall take the advice of the noble lord lord mcintosh and endeavour to switch to adaptation for the remainder of our discussion on this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the house accepted in committee a government amendment to repeal paragraph of schedule to the housing act thus bringing within the right to buy housing which is particularly suitable for elderly people unless it forms part of a sheltered scheme <e> <s> the reason for proposing that was our very grave concern over the unfairness suffered by tenants of such housing since january when the secretary of state ceased to have the function of determining whether or not particular properties should be outside the right to buy <e>", "<cs> my lords i hoped that as a result of the fruitful discussions that took place earlier my noble friend lord monk bretton would not move his amendment on the basis that we believe that we have now covered the principal point at issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the house would thank me for repeating the arguments that i deployed on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> suffice it to say that we see a technical problem with relation to other points in the bill <e> <s> i have always accepted that the department has the point

reform has taken place during the past decade <e> <s> many in local government and this was particularly so when i was at the guildhall last night are happy to consider the prospect of calm waters and a peaceful future ahead <e>", "<cs> my lords the question on the order paper goes rather wider than the capital <e> <s> i suggest that the question asked by the noble lord lord hooson concerns the possibility of introducing a single tier of local government <e> <s> we believe that for the average man in the street albeit on the clapham omnibus the county is still something with which he identifies more closely than any other part of local government <e>", "<cs> my lords that question goes rather wider than the question that lies on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that when the noble lord comes to read the <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that government should provide a form of institution with the least possible inconvenience to the public which is an approach slightly different from that taken by the noble lord lord mcintosh <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not often bracket together rural and suburban communities <e> <s> traditionally we think of rural communities as declining and suburban communities as expanding <e> <s> but increasingly rural areas are now showing signs of prosperity and growth despite the decline of employment in agriculture and

debate <e> <s> before i say another word i should like to take this opportunity of congratulating the noble lord lord walpole on his excellent maiden speech and the firm views expressed in it <e> <s>

specific areas especially the price of art itself which has risen considerably faster than that <e> <s> we believe that the basic underlying trend demonstrates that is if demonstration is required

of beswick is well aware that the governments commitment is to success <e> <s> i am also <e>", "<cs> my lords from the latter part of the supplementary question from the noble lord lord dean i think

successful future of this country within europe and the world <e> <s> we cannot define in advance the types of jobs they will be <e>", "<cs> my lords as always i am very excited that the noble lord lord mcintosh feels that i am able to make radical changes to government policy on the hoof <e> <s> however i can assure him that we believe the udcs have been a great success and that the recent bill which has now become an act will also assist in providing opportunity for local authorities to increase their successful contribution <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to confess to the noble lord lord mellish that i was unaware of that specific point <e>", "<cs> my lords in the total capital expenditure on housing will be some billion <e> <s> i am sure that the noble baroness will be aware that on top of that figure over the next two years the government have a commitment to provide million specifically for the relief of homelessness <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the first part of the noble lords question i am sure he does not believe that this question provides a suitable means for dealing with the matter of housing requirements in this country between now and the year and the provision of a million units to which he referred <e> <s> however i can assure your lordships that the million to which i referred relates to some units in london and the south-east <e> <s> the association of london authorities has referred to a figure of some million <e> <s> it is clear from those two figures that the government have more than met the demand in the greatest area of pressure that we face today namely to remove the homeless from bed and breakfast accommodation <e>", "<cs> my lords the government certainly do have an answer to the problem raised by the noble lord <e> <s> with the new capital resources introduced by the local government and housing act we have produced the new generalised needs index which we believe will accommodate those requirements outside the pressure area of the south-east and london <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are well aware of the problems raised by the noble lord <e> <s> part of the problem goes wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> the government have nonetheless recognised the problem of homelessness <e> <s> we have suggested and produced a figure of million which as i pointed out earlier is in excess of the figure suggested by the association of london authorities to alleviate the problem in london and the south-east <e>", "<cs> my lords the government recognise that homeless as a definition encompasses all of the population and not only families <e>", "<cs> my lords the government recognise and welcome the contribution made by the voluntary sector <e> <s> i would point out that within the financial package for the homeless which i mentioned earlier some million is allocated to the voluntary sector <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe that the new housing act is encouraging the supply of privately rented accommodation offering tenants greater choice and providing a better return for landlords <e> <s> furthermore the shelter report <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the house will be interested to know

endorsed the policy that we should strengthen the legislation with regard to scheduled sites when a legislative opportunity arises <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble baroness will not be surprised when i say that the governments position is quite the reverse of what she suggested at the end of her remarks <e> <s> in order to achieve the best response to the questionnaire originally issued we offered a discretion for those who required it <e> <s> however i refer the noble baroness to my earlier answer when i said that when we have a suitable opportunity for legislation we shall take advantage of it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is fair to say that one of the great contributions that your lordships house makes to the country which we all live in and enjoy is that the question that has been put before the house this afternoon provides the very opportunity to which the noble lord lord strabolgi referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i am absolutely certain that the noble lord lord cledwyn

overspend that occurred for the previous year results in a net effect of per cent <e> <s> which is above inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords as always i am deeply indebted to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> with regard to inflation it would be appropriate to suggest to the house that although the rate in january was per cent <e> <s> for local government expenditure it would be

berkshire i should be more than happy to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords my experience at this dispatch box for as long as i have been representing the department of the environment is of constantly being accused by members on the benches opposite of not allowing local accountability <e> <s> i believe that the community charge will do that <e>", "<cs> my lords i always find it encouraging when i

friend presents <e> <s> however i am sure that the local voters will take that matter into account when they have time to consider excessive charges <e>", "<cs> my lords i was very clear in my answers

difficulties concerning lord deans question is this <e> <s> from the snapshot of the figures available because that is all we have so far the levels of the community charge raised taking to use his phrase the reputable press into account equate to an increase in domestic rates this year of per cent <e> <s> that is a very worrying fact <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always very grateful for an intervention by the noble lord lord callaghan <e> <s> it would be fair to say however that that is a matter which is above my station <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already said it is important that

government who wish to act on concrete evidence <e>", "<cs> my lords the so-called reaction experienced during the past few days has not been entirely representative <e>", "<cs> my lords we must wait to see the result and the noble lord lord dormand gave me the benefit of the doubt and judge the situation after st april <e>", "<cs> my lords i gave the figure of per cent <e> <s> to which my right honourable friend the prime minister referred with regard to the effect on domestic rates this year <e> <s> that was on the basis that the projected figure and there is no certainty as yet in the

i can assure my noble friend that provision will be made <e> <s> i draw your lordships attention to the three recommendations in the priestley report <e> <s> the government accepted the first two but there was a further element in the third recommendation concerning linkage to the rp <e> <s> the government felt that they could not accept that element <e> <s> the arts council funding for the royal shakespeare company will rise to about million this year an increase of per cent <e> <s> which of course is above inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that if the government began issuing

important to remember that the government take the matter seriously because via the arts council they are handing over million this year <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact of the matter is and it is not glib to call it the fact of the matter because it is the facts that count that expenditure has increased by a third in real terms <e> <s> my right honourable friend the minister of state has recently stated the simple fact that a per cent <e> <s> increase in expenditure over the next three years will be available to the arts council <e> <s> it is also a fact that that is the decision of the arts

has been privileged to make a very constructive contribution to the hague conference and the measures already announced and agreed at the conference will ensure that the north sea is a cleaner and more wholesome sea <e>", "<cs> my lords the united kingdom made a number of commitments at the hague and it made those commitments in an important context which noble lords should understand <e> <s> we are a major industrial nation <e> <s> we have been accused on some fronts of not showing the desired amount of consideration <e> <s> i should point out that the accusation has been made by countries which are not major industrial nations <e>", "<cs> my lords the united kingdoms position is very straightforward and simple <e> <s> we have to provide a sensible solution <e> <s> we shall end all sewage sludge dumping by <e> <s> we are reducing such dumping where we can <e> <s> most important of all we accept that we have to find a solution <e> <s> the noble lord may question the governments position with regard to nuclear waste <e> <s> i should remind him that sweden is also engaged at this moment in having radioactive waste buried under the sea <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely correct <e> <s> the government have felt for some time that not enough attention has been paid to wildlife <e> <s> we are very satisfied with the result particularly as he pointed out with regard to dolphins and porpoises <e>", "<cs> my lords i have had the privilege of attending meetings held by the secretary of state with industrialists to discuss exactly the point raised by the noble lord <e> <s> i am sure that he is aware that environmentalists are to be seen within the portals of marsham street and that their advice has been sought in the past and will no doubt be sought again in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords it is fair to say that sometimes and quite wrongly the united kingdom is accused of being the dirty man of europe <e> <s> in fact the evidence has to be turned to the estuaries of the rhine the elbe the meuse and the scheldt <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the exact date in this respect <e> <s> however i shall certainly provide the noble lord lord northfield with a letter which will answer his question <e> <s> the british government have always taken the position of practicality <e> <s> we are committed to the abolition of dumping by because

at the conference upon the destruction of pcbs at home rather than elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord hatch had been listening he would have heard me say in my previous answer that it is not the british governments policy to introduce per cent <e> <s> unemployment on teesside <e>", "<cs> my lords we have signed an agreement which commits us not to dump industrial waste from

as to whether the department can actively monitor the situation over the above contributing cash resources towards the schemes <e> <s> however i shall draw the noble lords remarks to the attention of my honourable friend the minister for sport <e>", "<cs> my lords last year this house had extended discussions on the matters which my noble friend draws to our attention <e> <s> the important aspect about the question before us today is that we are trying to encourage young people to take an interest in the game <e> <s> whether we can reclaim the interest of those who engage in the activity of fighting and a football match is purely the scenario for this is a difficult and challenging problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i am firmly of the belief that this is a problem for football that has to be cured by football <e>", "<cs> my lords it is absolutely clear that all initiatives which have proved to be successful and which have been drawn to my attention by my noble friend should be looked at <e>", "<cs> my lords the fame of the success of the millwall scheme is such that my own officials at the department of the environment produced a document about it to show the respect in which it is held <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lord lord hatch was referring to the business rate <e> <s> that is i feel wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> however if he wishes to put down a question on the subject i should be more than happy to answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i said earlier to the noble lord lord graham that i would draw his concerns to the attention of my honourable friend the minister for sport <e> <s> however these schemes only work if there are willing participants on both sides <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether the noble lord is therefore suggesting the nationalisation of football clubs <e>", "<cs> my lords the auditor of the city of westminster has reported his provisional conclusions to the city council on certain transactions <e> <s> when he reaches his final conclusions the action that can be taken rests with the auditor and the courts and not her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to think that the answer that i gave to the noble lord lord jay in the first instance made it quite clear that the rule of law is being followed <e> <s> i cannot agree with the supposition that westminster is an extremist authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for my noble friends contribution to the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the government would be accused of gross intervention if we started to interfere in the affairs of a democratically elected body <e> <s> i should not wish to be the man to try to defend such a policy <e>", "<cs> my lords this matter has been very widely aired <e> <s> i think that no one in your lordships house would disagree with that <e> <s> i am sure that the electorate of westminster will be able to make its decision in the way it feels appropriate <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord hatch is under a misapprehension <e> <s> i went to some lengths not to refer to the community <e>", "<cs> my lords nothing has appeared before a court <e> <s> that is important <e>", "<cs> my lords all members of westminster city council will be up for re-election <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall answer first the last part of the question of the noble lord lord dean <e> <s> those in receipt of rebate will continue to receive it whatever the increase <e> <s> however i should also point out to the noble lord that even though he introduced examples of conservative authorities many times from this dispatch box i am accused for the government of interfering with local authorities <e> <s> it is not for the government to interfere but for the electorate to decide <e>", "<cs> my lords we face the perennial problem at the dispatch box that the decision has been reached by a locally elected authority <e> <s> i am constantly berated for the government interfering with local authorities <e> <s> this is something which the local authority must address to its tenants and electors <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all in your lordships house agree that canterbury is a unique city in our country <e> <s> however i must repeat what i said earlier that two facts are important <e> <s> first those in receipt of rebate will not be affected by the increase <e> <s> secondly it is a matter for the local authority to set the level of rent <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect i believe that i have answered it in the reply that i have just given <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that it is fair to describe these as swingeing increases <e> <s> there are many examples of authorities which have set the levels of rent below the guideline given by the government <e> <s> it is important to remember that the average council rent in the country is based on per week <e>", "<cs> my lords it is possible i suppose to extrapolate debt through to rent arrears <e> <s> however the department does not have the figures that specifically connect the two <e> <s> there is a very wide range <e> <s> if one examines the london area the arrears vary from per cent <e> <s> in brent to per cent <e> <s> in hackney <e> <s> i believe that my noble friend comes from the north-east <e> <s> he will be interested to know that of the five lowest authorities durhams rent arrears are only per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord will not be surprised that i am not willing to <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the government will have to wait to see the oppositions proposals in order to provide a reply to that question <e>", "<cs> my lords it is important to remember that we have in this country housing benefit <e> <s> the fact that the government have asked authorities to recognise the value of their property and the fact that we ring-fence the housing revenue account does not mean that we are imposing a policy in order to charge more and more rent <e> <s> it is important to remember that within the calculations reached by the department of the environment there is a factor for damping in order to protect <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have that figure available today the reason being that the year has not finished <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is referring to a surplus in rebate i can assure him that from the departments point of view that is seen only <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that that question is rather wide of the one on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that is the case because in the final analysis all adjustments are paid for by all council tenants and all taxpayers <e>", "<cs> my lords at present the figures for pollutants currently carried by major rivers into the north sea are monitored by each north sea state according to its own requirements <e> <s> the standards and methodology vary considerably <e> <s> some surveys have attempted to make a comparison on a common basis <e> <s> the first comprehensive exercise will take place this year co-ordinated by the paris commission <e>", "<cs> my lords it is an inevitable fact that the cleaning up of all countries will cost money which will be a burden on the taxpayer <e> <s> there is no such thing as a free lunch for the authorities just as there is no such thing as a free lunch for anyone else when it comes to cleaning up the environment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very important that in all cases the establishment of pollution is carried out on a like basis <e> <s> we hope very much that for the first time we shall be able to establish who is doing what <e> <s> the most recent dutch study confirmed that the rhine and the elbe contribute about per cent <e> <s> of north sea pollution <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that it is true that even though the appearance of our rivers has improved and what the noble lord said of the thames is also true of the tyne in this country there are still residual problems which cannot be removed because they lie within the ground itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the comprehensive exercise to be undertaken by the paris commission to which i referred earlier will provide exactly what my noble friend asks for <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a difficulty in giving such an undertaking <e> <s> the method of checking river discharges and establishing that they relate to a particular river are rather complex <e> <s> i can give my noble friend further updated figures <e> <s> i shall be more than happy to write to him since i have several sheets in front of me which i believe noble lords will not thank me for reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of the report to which the noble lord lord hatch has drawn my attention <e> <s> however i fear that he may not have listened with his usual accuracy to the remark that i made <e> <s> i referred to assistance to local authorities rather than to the general principle <e> <s> in the case of the local authorities the money would come from the taxpayer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that point <e> <s> this is a matter of national pride <e> <s> i hope that at the paris commission we shall for the first time obtain some proper like-on-like figures <e> <s> many comments have been made but the figures behind them are rather dubious <e> <s> if we are to be good europeans it is most important that we are all good europeans together <e>", "<cs> my lords it will be interesting to see whether mr ripa di meana will be the new publisher of that work when it is reissued in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that it was inevitable that the noble lord lord mcintosh would insinuate that in some way these regulations should be thrown out possibly on the basis of recent events <e> <s> however he will also believe and agree with me that it is important to persist in ensuring that as environmental standards rise where there is a basis for improving appearance we should be able to do so with or without the benefit of the aforesaid act <e>", "<cs> my lords the most substantial percentage increase on broad groupings it is difficult to describe a grouping concerns golf courses swimming pools and tennis facilities whose bills will rise on average by per cent <e> <s> for leisure and sports centres the average increase will be per cert <e> <s> however it is important to remember that local authorities will continue to have discretion to grant up to per cent <e> <s> rate relief on property occupied by non-profit-making bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords there are many differences between england and scotland which include the rating of sports facilities <e> <s> in addition scotland has a different poundage to that in england <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for pointing out the tremendous contribution that my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer will make to the improvement of football grounds due to the changes that he suggested in the budget <e> <s> many of the revaluations have taken place because as noble lords will be aware many football grounds have introduced highly successful commercial boxes <e> <s> it is only right and proper that that should be reflected in the revaluation <e>", "<cs> my lords clubs are in exactly the same position as any other building which is liable for the ubr <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord raises a good question <e> <s> the average rate bill for football grounds including inflation but before transition will fall by per cent <e> <s> which i am sure as a keen football follower he will be pleased about <e> <s> i thought that the noble lord might raise that point this afternoon and i am pleased to report to him that the spurs will be looking at a reduction from to before transitional relief <e>", "<cs> my lords all sports clubs are in exactly the same position as other ubr-payers <e> <s> they will be in receipt of transitional relief if there is an upward revaluation <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be more than happy to receive any information that the noble lord cares to give me concerning particular cases and draw them to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend is encouraged by the information which i provided about the situation from st april <e> <s> that answers the problem that he faced in the highland region but the matter is at the discretion of the local authority <e>", "<cs> my lords in each case the local authority has an option to charge on five bands from zero to two <e>

administration have been granted there is a further three months when no charge can be levied <e>", "<cs> my lords i have never been able to aspire to be a writer to the signet <e> <s> however there are differences between the legal systems north and south of the border <e> <s> i believe that there is no probate or letters of administration under scottish law and therefore there is an anomaly <e> <s> i know that many of your lordships would defend the scottish legal system to the death but under it on this occasion it would be difficult to have an interface to use a terrible word because of the two different legal systems <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have never suggested that they wished to tamper with the laws of scotland so there will always be anomalies <e>", "<cs> my lords as with so many policies introduced by all governments a modification to legislation is not always retrospective <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i shall draw my noble friends remarks to the attention of my right honourable friend <e> <s> however it is important to remind the house that before the introduction of the community charge if a property remained furnished rates were payable from the time the occupant died <e> <s> the proposals now before the house are an improvement in terms of fiscal loss <e>", "<cs> my lords i assure the noble lord that if we were about to introduce a system of rating there would be howls of protest about the levels of discrimination that cannot be conceived under the community charge <e>", "<cs> my lords i point out to the noble lady that under the previous rating system rates were payable from the estate from the date of death <e> <s> what has happened now is an improvement because there will be a six-month period which will be community charge free

press on future possibilities and i humbly suggest that may well result in the country not having a change of government after the next election <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall look at the point and also discuss it with the noble lord <e> <s> the noble earl lord attlee the noble baroness lady stedman and other noble lords raised the question of the small village shop <e> <s> here we are seeing the reverse side of the coin of what happens if there is not a revaluation in years <e> <s> the definition of what a village shop is would be impossible to agree <e> <s> the noble baroness also berated

graces and it is up to them to decide whether they consider that years is acceptable <e> <s> it has nothing to do with her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords i remind the noble baroness that the key to the problem is that the rothschild offer is a variation on a scheme which does not exist <e> <s> as i said earlier that is one reason that further consideration is taking place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised that the noble lord does not recall an event which caused a certain amount of concern in the art world last october when a private offer was made for the blake-varley sketchbook <e> <s> that offer was unable to fulfil the conditions that existed at the time and thus the sketchbook was lost to this country even had it remained in a private collection available to scholars <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord jenkins is now trying to draw me into a very general area of nearly unlimited public expenditure in anticipation that all estates will be allowed to apply to offset estate duty arrangements for any cause which one may care to name <e> <s> i look at the noble lord lord barnett as his eyes roll somewhat at the thought that i should be able to commit the government to that <e> <s> i assure your lordships that i cannot provide an answer which the noble lord lord jenkins would consider to be suitable and satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords the object of the secretary of states change in policy was not to restrict but to expand the opportunities for retaining artistic objects of virtue in this country <e> <s> there was no public offer to fund the purchase of the three graces at the time <e> <s> regardless of what the government do agreement has to be reached between a willing vendor and a willing buyer <e> <s> the government cannot intervene in that arrangement <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of the date th april was to provide an opportunity for views to be received by the secretary of state <e> <s> he is now reviewing those views <e>", "<cs> my lords the opening remarks of the noble lord lord mcintosh in what can only be described geographically as a very wide-ranging address to the house alluded to the fact that this afternoon could possibly be misinterpreted as a labour party seminar on matters concerning the inner cities <e> <s> he went on to suggest that there was not enough interest on this side of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am slightly surprised that the noble lord has asked that question <e> <s> he knows that very substantial amounts of government housing are owned by the ministry of defence and are situated in the middle of salisbury plain where they are not effectively able to play a constructive role would that they were in helping to solve the inner city problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble lord is aware that the government see the role of local authorities as enablers in housing <e> <s> at the moment there is a gap which is difficult to cross <e> <s> the government are extremely keen to eliminate that gap <e> <s> at present there is local authority housing <e> <s> we are now introducing more and more housing association housing to provide a staircase so that people can move and have flexibility in the housing market <e> <s> the noble lord will not need me to remind him that compared with west germany france and the united states we have a deplorable record in terms of private rented housing <e> <s> we have only per cent <e> <s> in the united kingdom <e> <s> to rectify this we have changed the direction of housing policy not our commitment to providing housing <e>", "<cs> my lords i now propose to move on to the questions raised by noble lords including the noble lords lord mcintosh lord pitt lord hatch of lusby lord ardwick lord rea and the noble baroness lady nicol about the environment <e> <s> the noble lord lord rea referred to the possibilities of the bicycle <e> <s> i have a question for the noble lord which i am sure he would be happy to answer outside the house later on this evening <e> <s> if it takes minutes to come down from kentish town how long does it take to get back up particularly if one is slightly overweight <e>", "<cs> my lords the crucial point is that the volume that has to be reduced to make a suitable <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state looked carefully at producing what he felt was a suitable level of capping <e> <s> i should have thought that per cent <e> <s> and per adult are straightforward figures rather than convenient ones <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes to put down a question on the uniform business rate which i believe he was referring to with regard to my right honourable friend i shall be more than happy to answer it when i see it on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are well aware that different circumstances exist in different boroughs <e> <s> that is why we have the system of ssas <e> <s> your lordships may be interested to know that the governments contribution in lambeth for example is per adult per annum compared with in the borough of bromley <e>", "<cs> my lords i should repeat to the noble lord the reply that i have already given which showed that the range in the amount of money involved in an ssa is considerable <e> <s> i refer again to the figure of and to a figure as high as <e> <s> the figure in barnsley was million <e> <s> it dropped to million because barnsley was one of the authorities which came within the criteria set by my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the simple fact is that the critiera were set on a similar basis to those which existed before under the former grant related expenditure scheme <e> <s> we think that we have set the criteria at a fair level <e> <s> they apply equally to all authorities <e> <s> berkshire did not fall into the category that other authorities did <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a fact that people had no chance to make any statement at the ballot box with regard to the first setting of the community charge <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord always produces seductive arguments <e> <s> i could equally reply to him that we could have decided not to exclude <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that occasionally if i do not look at my brief i find myself beginning to believe that all authorities are assessed on the same basis <e> <s> then when i look back at my brief i am reminded that there are huge and generous concessions to take account of local difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords that is why we introduced the community charge <e>", "<cs> my lords a number of percentages have been bandied about in the very large number of questions which i have answered from this dispatch box over the past few months <e> <s> my right honourable friend chose a figure which was broadly similar on an assessment basis to that under the old system <e> <s> the fact that the authorities concerned are not conservative-controlled has nothing to do with the fact that the authorities meet the criteria <e>", "<cs> my lords the figure which i can confirm is that the higher rates charged by authorities across the nation would have resulted in a domestic rate increase of some per cent <e> <s> that is why a large number of people who have not paid rates before have been surprised by the level of local authority expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments assessment was based on local authority expenditure and not on political considerations <e> <s> that is why i do not have an answer to the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> my lords i agreed with the noble baroness <e> <s> i am sure that when she inspects <e>", "<cs> my lords the uptake of unleaded petrol in the past months has risen from per cent <e> <s> to the figure that i quoted to my noble friend namely some - per cent <e> <s> i do not have the figure since but since - these are the most recent figures for the amount of lead in the atmosphere there has been a fall of some per cent <e>", "<cs> far from that my lords the recent budget increased the differential for the third successive time which i am sure shows the chancellors intention <e>", "<cs> my lords a substantial number of vehicles can be converted <e> <s> they are all to be found listed in a copy of <e>", "<cs> my lords out of some stations approximately now sell unleaded petrol <e>", "<cs> my lords any government has to control gross public spending including spending from receipts in order to regulate the national economy <e> <s> allowing those local authorities who happen to have a lot of receipts to spend more would mean cutting expenditure in areas of more acute need <e> <s> the aim of our reforms of the use of receipts is to enable us more effectively to target resources on those areas in greatest need <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that with his experience the noble lord lord jay is more aware than i am of the importance for any government to control the gross figure for public expenditure <e> <s> it is well worth remembering that the latest available figure for the current level of local authority housing debt is some - billion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord lord molloy is aware of the governments most recent initiative of increasing expenditure for homelessness by some million <e> <s> he will also be aware that the government are increasing the expenditure by housing associations to some million in - <e>", "<cs> my lords per cent <e> <s> of the receipts are still available to do exactly that <e> <s> however as a result of capital reforms that we introduced in last years bill we have been able <e>", "<cs> my lords in recent years the government have increased finance beyond the traditional figures of local authority provision and that provided by housing associations <e> <s> we believe that the changes that took place in the budget with regard to the business expansion scheme will provide in the first months a further units to be available under assured tenancies <e> <s> those are extremely important <e> <s> at the moment there are only two types of housing <e> <s> we have to follow the success that has been achieved in the united states west germany and france which has a socialist administration <e> <s> there per cent <e> <s> of the population are in private rented accommodation <e> <s> that was destroyed in this country over a period of years <e>", "<cs> my lords the rules are different for revenue and capital <e> <s> as i pointed out earlier if there were a reduction of debt which relates to the per cent <e> <s> that is held back that would improve the financial position of the council <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have no desire other than to improve the quality and supply of housing <e> <s> as the noble lord will know and i have said it before in this house the government see the local authorities as enablers in housing <e> <s> they are spending very considerable sums of money but they also wish to broaden the spread of housing <e> <s> they are also desirous that the money spent on housing should produce quality rather than result in the tragedies because that is the only way that one can describe them seen in some of the great cities of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords local authorities already own a vast store of local authority housing <e> <s> the noble lord asks me how we see the future <e> <s> the future that we see is one where there is a spread one in which there is a ladder that goes from the simplest to the less simple accommodation and also across a spectrum of cost so that people can have an aspiration which can be satisfied to rent a house that is other than an ordinary local authority dwelling <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are certainly aware of the need <e> <s> that is why they introduced the special increase of some million for the homeless <e> <s> there is also another factor <e> <s> if we consider rural housing where there are equally difficult problems although of a different nature it is clear that one of the most difficult things to obtain is planning permission in order to provide that accommodation <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are entirely in favour of consumer choice but they do not believe that the local authorities money is in fact their money it is the taxpayers money <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i sense that amendment no <e> <s> is a mischievous amendment if it could be so described designed to compel the government to sell the psa and tcs as a single entity <e> <s> in practice it will delay the sale of the tcs <e> <s> as the noble lord is aware that matter is already under way <e> <s> the committee is aware that the competition for the sale of the tcs in up to three parts has begun and is expected to be completed this year <e> <s> it would be premature at this stage to settle the form in which the psa should be sold including whether it is to be sold as a single unit or in parts <e> <s> that sale will not be before october at the earliest <e> <s> but as with the tcs decisions will take account of the return for the taxpayer the future of the businesses and most importantly the interests of the staff <e>", "<cs> tcs and psa have many assets but i can assure the committee that hundreds of thousands of acres are not included <e>", "<cs> i interrupt the noble lord merely to draw the attention of the committee to the fact that it is not the tradition of this chamber to quote in a current session from what has been said by a member in another place <e>", "<cs> the opposition have already argued in another place that the act should not relate to work which the psa undertakes in northern ireland <e> <s> they have made much of security as if the mere mention of the word settles the issue beyond further argument <e> <s> but the question is much more complex than that <e> <s> the government have already made it clear that they will not do anything that is contrary to national security <e> <s> if the psa undertakes any activities in northern ireland that on the advice of the security authorities would be prejudiced or put at risk by privatisation those activities will remain the governments responsibility <e> <s> security in northern ireland as elsewhere is the responsibility of the customer who commissions the work not of the psa <e> <s> further the psa undertakes work in northern ireland which is not related to the security services <e>", "<cs> i am more than happy to answer the point <e> <s> the psa is essentially a service organisation it provides integrated services <e> <s> thus each contract and each job will require a new assessment <e> <s> it will be an ongoing discussion where it provides services to any customer whether it be the mod which may present a higher risk in northern ireland than the department of agriculture <e> <s> as each service contract is provided and each turnkey project is dealt with at the start of the analysis of each project there will be an assessment made by the customer together with the psa if it is the service provider and others <e> <s> if you go down the tree you must look at the position of the contractors which the psa may have selected to come in to carry out the contract and at what the position is as regards security in each case <e> <s> at the end of the day the responsibility must rest at the top with the customer which if it was the mod in northern ireland would be the mod <e>", "<cs> at the risk of boring members of the committee the argument which the noble lord lord dean put forward may be attractive on the surface <e> <s> he gave the example of the rof but there is a further example in a modem society communications are vitally important and one could use the same argument about british telecom and say that that also should remain within the state sector for the purposes of security <e>", "<cs> these amendments would prevent the incorporation of the psa or tcs and their sale to purchasers until certain conditions relating to profitability the availability of accounts and the valuation of shares have been met <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> would delay the incorporation of the psa until at least since it does not yet have audited accounts <e> <s> the tcs did not meet the criterion on a current cost basis in the months ending st december the last year for which results are available <e> <s> so for the tcs too the delay would be considerable <e> <s> to decide now to delay privatisation of either the psa or the tcs to this extent would not be sensible <e>", "<cs> the answer is fairly straightforward <e> <s> as the noble lord lord graham is well aware most of the previous privatisations were not of service organisations <e> <s> however these two bodies are essentially service organisations <e> <s> they will be judged on their perceived ability <e> <s> i hope that anyone who is interested in tcs and as the noble lord lord graham is aware we are a considerable way from privatisation of the psa and it will not occur before will take into account the glowing references that the noble lord made earlier this afternoon <e>", "<cs> i have already assured the committee that the government will not privatise any activities which on the advice of the security authorities would thereby be prejudiced or put at risk <e> <s> but this amendment would go far wider and exclude all work related to national security whether or not there were any good security reasons for doing so <e> <s> the amendment may reflect a misunderstanding about the nature of the psas security responsibilities and the respective roles of government and their contractors <e> <s> the amendment may also reflect a presumption that the public sector has a monopoly of trust in security matters <e>", "<cs> the first point to make absolutely clear is that the situation regarding responsibility for security which will pertain in the future is exactly the same as the situation which pertains today in terms of the decision-making process <e> <s> because of the changes which are implied particularly in the case of the psa and i remind the noble lord lord graham that we are speaking of no sooner than discussions are taking place now between the united states air force and the mod <e> <s> in the case of germany there is a government-to-government agreement <e> <s> because there is to be a change in the future and the psa will no longer be a government agency discussions are also taking place with the german government <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i shall be able to provide an instantaneous response <e>", "<cs> it may be helpful if i begin by explaining the background to clause <e> <s> it was designed to ensure that the transfer of the psa and the tcs to the private sector did not result in the staff being regarded as redundant <e>", "<cs> i do not deny that the staff of psa and tcs face a period of considerable change <e> <s> but it has been made very clear both to this chamber and another place that so far as concerns their terms and conditions of service the staff will not be disadvantaged by the privatisations <e>", "<cs> these six amendments all relate to the redundancy terms for the staff transferred to the new psa and tcs companies <e> <s> they seek to do two things first to provide the transferred staff with the same benefits they have at present and secondly to provide for the protection of those benefits by means of a treasury guarantee a special fund to pay benefits or by dedicating assets to underwrite the payments <e>", "<cs> my lords i never like to think that the government give the longest reply at the dispatch box but i have done a considerable amount of research into this subject which i feel may be of assistance and i hope not too boring for the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i should like to begin by explaining the governments proposals for pensions in relation to these two privatisations <e> <s> both the psa and the tcs are commercial undertakings to which the transfer of undertakings protection of employment regulations will apply <e> <s> these are known as tupe <e> <s> tupe will ensure that when the undertakings are sold the staffs contracts of employment are not terminated by the transfer of the undertakings <e> <s> the regulations will further ensure that the staffs terms and conditions of employment remain unchanged <e> <s> the single exception is that occupational pension schemes are excluded from the transfer <e> <s> in this respect tupe is fully consistent with the european communitys acquired rights directive <e> <s> nevertheless employees are protected by united kingdom employment law and might be able to claim that they have been unfairly dismissed if after the transfer the pension provisions offered by the new owner are not broadly comparable with their existing pension provisions <e>", "<cs> the first and most important point is that i can repeat the last of the several undertakings that i gave in my first reply <e> <s> as a last resort if these routes proved impossible we should compensate the staff for any pensions disadvantage <e> <s> that states the governments position very clearly <e>", "<cs> i do not deny that the staff of the psa and the tcs face a period of considerable change and upheaval <e> <s> but it has been made very clear both in this chamber and in another place that as concerns their terms and conditions of service the staff will not be disadvantaged by the privatisations <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord graham said this concerns the affirmative resolution procedure <e> <s> i am only sorry that my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter is not present in the chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to morale the yeoman warders have long been staff of the department of the environment and we believe that they are a loyal and committed body of staff who command the full confidence of the governor <e> <s> with regard to the command of the armed garrison with the agreement of the general officer commanding london district troops on duty at the tower are on detachment and form a separate garrison headed by the officer of the london tower guard reporting to the resident governor <e> <s> they operate under written orders agreed with the ministry of defence to ensure the security of the crown jewels <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very conscious that the noble baroness feels that she received a short answer <e> <s> i suspect that the reason is that there are no proposals for change at present <e> <s> if any changes are proposed they will take place over the next year or longer period after consultations have taken place <e> <s> the difficulty is that the answer which the noble baroness received reflects the truth of the matter <e> <s> there was more speculation in the press than was warranted by the facts <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the historic royal palaces agency operates south rather than north of the border <e> <s> however if the noble lady wishes to table a question regarding north of the border i shall be happy to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall answer the last question of the noble lord lord cledwyn first <e> <s> as i said in my previous answer there has been a great deal of speculation for which there is no basis of fact <e> <s> as regards the position of the govenor for the past years he has been a civil servant <e> <s> the present governor was the first governor from a military background who won the job on the basis of open competition <e> <s> the position of the governor in the royal household is entirely a matter for the royal household and not a matter for the government <e>", "<cs> my lords for the past years the governor has been responsible to a civil servant in the department of the environment <e> <s> his position <e>", "<cs> my lords the governor and the yeoman warders are employed by the department of the environment <e> <s> it is through that system that their terms and conditions are agreed <e>", "<cs> my lords only per cent <e> <s> of the entire and invaluable collection of the royal armouries is available to be seen <e> <s> there are real problems of display within the confines of the tower of london itself <e> <s> the royal armouries desire the opportunity to investigate the possibility of a bigger display in better circumstances and are reviewing a number of options in order to provide that for the benefit of the public and in the interests of the heritage of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is slightly incorrect because there is already sunday afternoon opening rather than no opening at all on a sunday which she suggested <e> <s> the position of all royal palaces and great heritage sites will be reviewed constantly in the years ahead <e> <s> i also point out to the noble baroness that hampton court where the other royal chapel exists is already open on sunday mornings <e> <s> however any changes will take place on a basis of investigation and not speculation <e>", "<cs> my lords the basis of review is that i cannot provide an answer with certainty today <e>", "<cs> my lords last night i dined in the white tower and was completely unaware of any suggestion that the armouries were to be taken out of the white tower <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the level of interest in the question in your lordships house this afternoon reveals that he has <e>", "<cs> my lords i assure the noble earl that the department fully understands that the reason that the tower of london is the most important tourist attraction in the united kingdom is in great part due to the very facts which he has given to us this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords estimated emissions million tonnes of carbon dioxide carbon monoxide nitrogen oxides and volatile organic <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the exact date for when the figures will be available <e> <s> as with all the emission figures as the noble lord lord hatch is well aware we are waiting for the results of the ipcc conference which comes in the autunm at which time we shall be able to look further at the results and see what are the challenges that lie ahead <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful having had a patchy educational career in physics to have had the error pointed out to me by the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord graham tables a question with regard to the impact on health and the national health service my noble friend lord henley will be happy to answer him <e> <s> the most important feature of resolving the difficulties that lie ahead for the world is that they must be dealt with on a worldwide basis <e> <s> that is why the government stick strictly to the basis that we wait for the results of the ipcc conference in the autumn whereby on a universal basis which is the only way we can tackle these problems we can start to reach judgments <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord ezra tables a question on that point i shall be more than happy to answer him <e> <s> i might otherwise mislead your lordships house on the basis of the huge number of facts that i have with regard to the four points raised this afternoon by the noble lord lord hatch on the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i not only confirm my noble friends suggestion which is absolutely correct but i also suggest to the noble lord lord hatch that he should enthusiastically support nuclear power which would have an enormous effect on reducing carbon dioxide emissions <e>", "<cs> my lords in response to the first part of the question of the noble lord lord hatch of course the government take very seriously any select committee report <e> <s> in answer to the second part of his question this is a global problem <e> <s> the only way that we can attack a global problem is with a global answer which is why we are awaiting the ipcc report <e>", "<cs> my lords if i am right in assuming that my noble friend in his supplementary question is referring to the offer of the barclay brothers i must point out that that offer has nothing to do with the government it is an offer to the owners of the statue <e> <s> in answer to the second part of his question which i believe was also mentioned in <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble baronesss multitudinous questions and starting with the last suggestion she makes a reasonable assumption <e> <s> it would be a reasonable change in public expenditure policy on the basis of the increase in the value of the statue if at any future point it was to be considered for sale <e> <s> i suggest that the noble baroness does not consider that it ever would be for sale in the future and thus the implication that it would be of benefit to public expenditure is hypothetical rather than factual <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that nothing is ever by personal edict of the minister <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state proposed an extension of the criteria in order to provide the protection to which i referred in previous answers <e> <s> that protection was necessary because of the uncertainty and unhappiness in the art world which stretched back to last october when an object was lost based on a private offer within the united kingdom <e> <s> those are the facts of the case <e>", "<cs> my lords the waverley rules of were based on the act which has been the basis of all protection <e> <s> that position has not changed for a very long time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always looking forward to the noble lords cheers <e> <s> i remind him that the decision will be made by the owner and not by the government because the statue is the property of the owner and not of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments involvement is limited only to the case where the owner is desirous of exporting the work of art <e> <s> at the end of the day the decision will be down to the owner <e> <s> in this case which is the important case to which my noble friend refers the secretary of state has taken time in reaching his decision in order to be in receipt of all representations and to be fully aware of the facts as he sees them <e>", "<cs> my lords in response to the noble lords four questions first i am well aware of the conference that is taking place today <e> <s> the fact is that the populations not only of this country but of many others have responded to the liability if i may use that word of cfcs to the atmosphere <e> <s> and that for all members of your lordships house i should have thought is an extremely encouraging event <e> <s> with regard to the production of cfcs as opposed to consumption the figures are falling below those required by the montreal protocol <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the first part of the noble earls question a number of local authorities have already taken the initiative <e> <s> in answer to the second part i can tell him that in the united kingdom there are only two manufacturers of cfcs which are willing to recycle all the cfcs that are returned <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is correct <e> <s> one of the reasons why the production of cfcs in this country has not fallen as fast as consumption is because we still export cfcs <e> <s> that is because we do not consider it is a good idea to encourage their production in other countries <e> <s> my noble friend is perfectly right to point out the second issue <e> <s> we shall only succeed in the removal and overal reduction of cfcs if it is done on a universal rather than an individual basis <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the individual figures for government plants and the return of cfcs <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have always taken the view that we have to proceed on a step-by-step basis <e> <s> the third meeting of the montreal protocol is to be held in london this summer <e> <s> if there is anything that can be usefully put into that meeting in terms of achieving a result and as long as that can be done on a universal basis the government will go ahead with it <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not answer the question in the way that the noble lord requires <e> <s> as the government we have to deal with reality rather than with hope <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that members of this house remember very well that last year a hugely successful international conference took place in london concerning cfcs and the ozone layer <e> <s> the reason for that successful conference was very straightforward namely that the government of this country recognise that it is only by universal action that the problem can be dealt with <e> <s> to survive the problem cannot be dealt with by taking simple action on a smaller basis when the difficulties face us on a universal basis <e>", "<cs> my lords the companies involved in the manufacture of cfcs are spending a considerable sum of money on developing commercial alternatives <e> <s> it is all very well for the noble lord to ask what the government are doing but they are not manufacturers of cfcs <e> <s> it is rather difficult for the government to finance an alternative <e>", "<cs> i am most surprised by the suggestion made by the noble lord lord parry <e> <s> i like to think that my words will receive the unqualified <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of the amendment would be to delete the existing paragraph a of subsection and to substitute a provision whereby staff would effectively be regarded as having been compulsorily retired at the point of transfer <e> <s> they would therefore be entitled to the benefits that flow from this under the pcsps even though they will have retained their jobs and will in no sense be redundant <e>", "<cs> my lords i went to rather a lot of trouble over this matter <e> <s> this is the response to the point that the noble lord made <e>", "<cs> my lords the simple answer to that is as follows <e> <s> the noble lord lord graham raises a good point namely that he wishes to discuss this matter outside the house <e> <s> i can reassure him again <e> <s> i responded at committee stage saying that <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will recall that we dealt with an identical amendment in committee <e> <s> such an amendment if passed would give the staff the opportunity to veto both privatisations <e> <s> clearly this would not be acceptable to the government <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord graham tries to insinuate that the government have a policy of creating what he calls a good buy <e> <s> that is not true <e> <s> we have a policy of producing a viable and successful future <e> <s> part of that policy involves ensuring that the employees who go into the new undertaking are properly protected <e> <s> that has created cost with both these proposed privatisations <e> <s> it is purely a matter of good business sense to make sure that they are profitable in the future because they have the right level of morale <e> <s> the noble lord cannot have his cake and eat it <e> <s> the government and the taxpayer may make less money possibly because we wish to preserve those standards but the noble lord cannot at the same time say this is not a good buy <e> <s> he can have one thing or another but not both <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment relates to the redundancy terms for staff who are transferred to the new psa and tcs companies <e> <s> it seeks to provide the transferred staff with the same benefits as they have at present and also to provide for the protection of those benefits by means of a trust a fund or a treasury guarantee <e> <s> i dealt at length in committee with the redundancy terms and assured your lordships that arrangements will be made to ensure that after privatisation redundancy terms will be identical so far as possible to those which the staff have at present <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should begin by reminding your lordships that i made a lengthy and detailed statement in committee explaining the governments proposals for pensions in relation to these two privatisations <e> <s> i do not believe there is anything i can usefully add to what i said then <e>", "<cs> my lords i may be naive but i believe that the effect of amendment no <e> <s> is to delay the sale of the psa or tcs companies until the value of the shares has been established by the national audit office on the basis of audited accounts <e> <s> further it prevents the sales until the treasurys consent has been obtained and requires that their consent be subject to six years audited accounts being available <e>", "<cs> my lords the new councils over the years that lie ahead of them will obviously perceive what they feel is best on a country by country basis <e> <s> however i am sure that we shall be discussing this matter further and more intensively later in the day <e> <s> i can assure the noble baroness that the bill requires the councils concerned to consult with each other before exercising their functions in respect of sites which have been divided between two countries <e> <s> in fact there is a permissive power in the bill that allows joint activity to be conducted over a site if the two councils are minded to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend he is absolutely correct <e> <s> arrangements concerning the countryside rivers and many other spheres particularly as we live in a wider europe have to operate across borders and physical features too <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i agree with the noble lords use of the term sterilisation <e> <s> however i understand the point that he makes <e> <s> no doubt later today he will be reinforcing it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for my noble friends remarks and look forward to hearing his views later today <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that that is so but i am not sure whether it is right given the exact form in which the noble baroness put the question <e> <s> on the basis that i believe it is so i shall say yes <e> <s> i shall write to her if i am incorrect <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a great pleasure to answer any question tabled by the noble baroness lady nicol <e> <s> we fought to have the honour to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not proposing to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that the house and noble lords who took part in the debates in committee and on report will thank me for repeating the arguments which rebut the remarks made by the noble lord lord graham <e> <s> however i thank the noble lord lord graham and the noble lord lord dean who is not present today for the doughty and committed concern and attention that they gave to the bill in committee and on report and for the generous way in which they reacted with the government to the passage of the bill through your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first apologise to your lordships house <e> <s> later in the day i must attend upon her majesty the queen for a brief period of time and i shall then return to your lordships house <e> <s> the arrangements were made a considerable time ago <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord dean paints a picture of doom and gloom but i have to say that looking out of the top floor at marsham street i see nothing but a forest of cranes looking down to the east of this capital of ours <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of my noble friends remarks because that point has been drawn to my attention on previous occasions <e> <s> it is also true to say that in the south-east there will be some reduction in activity <e> <s> that is hardly surprising bearing in mind the enormous level of growth in commercial activity since which equates to an increase in real terms of about per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords the cumulative figures which i gave earlier to the noble lord lord dean refer of course to a combination of civil engineering and house building <e> <s> house building figures have dropped and that is hardly surprising because they always respond to the level of mortgage interest rates <e> <s> however it is a fact that we must curb inflation and that is why we have high levels of interest <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are acutely aware of the fact that the real losers under inflation are the poor the weak and those on fixed incomes <e> <s> they need to be protected <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness may remember my earlier remarks for example the housing corporations gross capital expenditure will rise from just over million to - billion by - an increase of nearly per cent <e> <s> that shows the governments commitment in regard to providing subsidised housing <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give my noble friend that assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords i disagree strongly with the noble lord lord williams of elvel but rather more important i feel that he is now straying into an area where my noble friend the paymaster general may be able to provide a more satisfactory reply rather than now delaying the house on a rather difficult and technical subject which is not entirely to do with the rate of construction activity in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures i gave to the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal were to show the governments level of commitment <e> <s> for the first quarter of the total number of housing starts was <e> <s> that is a provisional figure <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the figures for relating to the noble lords question <e> <s> however i can assure the noble lord that the construction activity to which the question relates is the total level of construction activity and is not for house building as a separate item <e> <s> it is running at a record level and even if there is a downturn it will still be running at a record level this year <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord dean now drifts of f into following the noble lord lord williams in regard to manufacturing industry <e> <s> that is another question for another day <e> <s> however it is interesting to note that the benches opposite are not interested in the level of expenditure and growth in capital projects that will come from central government which this year will be about per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that noble lords or all sides of the house are well aware of the problems arising from irresponsible dog ownership which the noble lord elucidated with the figures that he gave <e> <s> the government are discussing with the rspca and others the consultation document which we produced last year <e> <s> we may even be considering strengthening some of the recommendations or suggestions therein <e> <s> before the house rises for the summer recess there may well be further opportunities to discuss these matters in greater detail <e>", "<cs> my lords the government and all governments i believe are constantly vigilant in regard to rabies <e> <s> as to the effect that rabies would have on a dog registration scheme i take the example of northern ireland where a licensing scheme has been operating for six years <e> <s> less than one-third of the dogs in northern ireland are part of that scheme <e> <s> the government have reservations about the effect of a registration scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i refer back to the previous question i answered <e> <s> if we are speaking about an effective control for rabies and we adopt a system which effectively registers only one-third of all dogs apart from ones views of such a scheme i would consider the success of using it as a tool against rabies to be doubtful <e> <s> in regard to future activities i am sure that the noble lord would be extremely surprised to find a minister speculating from this dispatch box <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully appreciate the feelings of the noble lord in regard to a dog registration scheme but i refer him back to the figures i produced from northern ireland where a licensing scheme has been in operation for six years but only one-third or less of the dogs are licensed <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the noble lords first remarks <e> <s> he also made the very good point oft forgotten that within my little file i have in front of me there is a weighty amount of paper filled with existing legislation and opportunities for local authorities which have not been taken up <e>", "<cs> my lords it is on the basis of the figures given by those operating the scheme and what they believe <e> <s> the figures are one-third for the whole of the province and one-half in belfast which has more dog wardens <e>", "<cs> my lords that is entirely true <e> <s> i believe i am correct in saying that the proponents of a registration scheme are in favour of it being self-financing but the worrying fact is that that assumes a fairly high level of take-up <e> <s> the figures i have seen convince me that the take-up will be low in which case the proportionate cost of such a scheme will become extremely onerous <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my understanding that there has been little loss of registered common land in recent years <e> <s> the noble lord lord hunt made reference to the recent decision of your lordships house <e> <s> i understand that the loophole that was considered a risk has been greatly reduced <e> <s> it is important to remember that in order to achieve a satisfactory result in this matter consensus is all-important <e> <s> that is why my right honourable friend che secretary of state is listening to all the recommendations and appeals that have been made to him <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hunt alluded earlier to the moorlands association which has an important interest in this matter <e> <s> the noble baroness will be aware that the association was not a party to the discussions as it did not exist at the time of the common land forum <e> <s> i remind your lordships that the farmers union of wales also did not concur with the common land forum at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords i remind the noble baroness of my earlier answer <e> <s> it is the governments intention to produce such a bill and responsibly we believe that that depends on consensus <e> <s> what matters is preservation in the longer term which would be impossible to achieve by following the example given and producing the wrong legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that a great deal of work has been done by the civil service over a considerable period of time <e> <s> i remind your lordships house that the royal commission originally discussed this matter in <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend correctly points out that the successful achievement of legislation in this matter will depend on goodwill balance and common sense <e>", "<cs> my lords from all that i have seen of the prospective legislation if one can describe it as such there are a large number of technicalities which will involve not so much a discreet and small bill but quite a lengthy one <e>", "<cs> my lords because the birds do not have votes <e>", "<cs> my lords under section consent is normally refused unless it can be shown that it will be in the interests of the chargepayers of the disposing authority <e> <s> each case that comes before <e>", "<cs> my lords if one looks at the name of the centre one sees that various groups attend it <e> <s> however the interest here is with regard not to the cost of the operation on a revenue basis but with regard to the property itself which is held by the lrb <e>", "<cs> my lords the lease that is effective at the moment lasts until august <e> <s> it is not within the lrbs remit to deal with the matters of policy to which the noble lord referred <e>", "<cs> my lords in the current property market i would say that it was a fluctuating figure <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mcintosh as always makes a forceful case <e> <s> however it is important to realise that although the figure of is accurate with regard to the total stock held or managed by the london residuary body the important issue here is section of the act <e> <s> that has applied to only six properties this is the seventh <e>", "<cs> my lords if a property is considered significant enough to come under the terms of section and must go before the secretary of state it must be judged in each and every case on its merits <e> <s> the first six properties were considered to have those merits <e> <s> on the seventh with regard to the matters to which i referred earlier concerning the prospects for the relationship to the chargepayers the merits did not appear the same <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i am correct in saying that if the word unacceptable has been used in the context to which the noble viscount referred it refers to the level of subsidy <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments policies seek to satisfy peoples housing needs by increasing consumer choice and good housekeeping <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the problem referred to by the noble lord <e> <s> but it is important to understand the context of the problem <e> <s> it is owing to success <e> <s> the success resides in the impressive speed of take-up which with the new financial system under the housing corporation has proceeded at a far greater pace than we ever expected <e> <s> thus there is now a slight slowing down because there was already an increase in the number of houses going up <e> <s> if one were to look at a graph one would find that as of today there are more housing starts than were expected because of the success of the take-up <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier to the noble lord lord dean what happened under the introduction of the new system was that it went too fast at the start <e> <s> the suggestion of the noble lord is that even more money should be brought into the system <e> <s> i suggest that my first answer to the noble lord lord dean pointing out that expenditure would rise from some million to billion between now and shows the level of the governments commitment <e>", "<cs> my lords regrettably i do not have a separate breakdown of the figures for wales <e> <s> however i shall write to the noble lord lord lloyd <e>", "<cs> my lords i draw the noble lords attention to the initiative of some million announced by the government several months ago <e> <s> i draw his attention also to the fact that the government recognise that the problem exists <e>", "<cs> my lords it is important to remember that the housing corporation is still reviewing its position <e> <s> as regards such bodies it is not for the government constantly to initiate direct action <e>", "<cs> my lords an example which reflects part of the problem referred to in the question is that as a result of the change the completion of schemes in the voluntary sector has dropped from approximately four years to two years <e> <s> that must be a change for the good <e> <s> however the change has brought problems with it <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have a specific figure for the number of dwellings above shops <e> <s> however i am sure that if my noble friend wishes to table a question i can endeavour to find a satisfactory answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i have answered various questions on the subject from various angles and at various times since i had the honour of accepting the position which i hold <e> <s> the noble lord lord mcintosh has made those points previously no doubt he will make them again <e> <s> the fact is that the government have responded and have taken initiatives <e> <s> the hope is to provide a better level of results <e> <s> that in part has caused some of the problems referred to by the noble lord lord dean at the beginning of his question <e>", "<cs> my lords the figure for completions in <e>", "<cs> my lords the question asked by the noble lord is slightly wide of that on the order paper <e> <s> the figure for completions in that i have with me which i am sure the noble lord lord donoughue would prefer to that which i do not have is <e>", "<cs> my lords i remain uncertain about whether the noble lord lord dean has appreciated the fact that although there has been a reduction in the number of starts this year there was an increase above the level anticipated for the past year <e>", "<cs> my lords it will come as no surprise to the noble baroness that in certain replies mention was made of resourcing <e> <s> however as the noble baroness is aware those matters are dealt with when the situation is reviewed for the ssa <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i am pleased that we can begin our committee proceedings on this bill in complete agreement in that this part of the bill should be a waste minimisation measure <e> <s> that is the purpose of the new clause tabled by the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> it is also a major purpose of clause of the bill <e> <s> both the noble lord and i wish to see available techniques used to prevent pollution both the noble lord and i wish to require the applicant to show that he will make use of such techniques to prevent or reduce pollution both the noble lord and i agree that guidance on costs related to techniques will be necessary and both the noble lord and i agree that in some cases the enforcing authority may revoke an authorisation <e>", "<cs> i apologise <e> <s> the fact is that the number is about <e> <s> it is also important to remember that in part i of the bill there is a very great number of further prescribed processes that are covered by local authorities air control <e> <s> they may not be as great but in certain areas many consider them to be important <e> <s> the noble lord also made reference to the trade in permits in the united states of america <e> <s> that may be the case there but it will certainly not be the case here <e> <s> it is for those reasons that i feel that though the noble lords amendment is admirable it is resistible <e>", "<cs> it is true to say that if the government had produced a bill which relied entirely on incentives i would be receiving a great weight and torrent of abuse at this dispatch box <e> <s> on matters of such importance as pollution deterrence has to have its role to play <e> <s> incentives may well develop in the future <e> <s> indeed as the noble lord lord clinton-davis is well aware a white paper on the environment is at this moment under consideration <e>", "<cs> products are in a sense slightly different from processes <e> <s> i can best illustrate that to my noble friend by giving the example of the montreal convention on cfcs <e> <s> the objective of the montreal convention in the longer term is the abolition of cfcs in other words the complete removal from our planet of an objectionable material <e> <s> the government take the view and this can also be seen in our proposals for the future levels of emissions from power stations that materials which are as objectionable as my noble friend lord renton suggests should be removed from the planet and not just from this country otherwise we would not achieve the objective <e>", "<cs> one learns something every day in this chamber <e> <s> the proposal of the noble lord lord mcintosh for an environmental protection executive has a very respectable lineage <e> <s> my noble friend lord cranbrook floated a similar idea last year and the year before that in another place the select committteee on the environment recommended the creation of such an executive <e>", "<cs> when i referred to a peculiarly british solution the noble lord lord mcintosh saw that as an opportunity immediately to denigrate my remarks <e> <s> since the passage of the water act last year my office has looked at the order papers as having a veritable drought of questions with regard to the pollution of water <e> <s> we have combined two bodies hmip and the nra to produce success <e> <s> it is no good the noble lord saying that because we are not to have an epa it does not work because we have shown that it has worked <e>", "<cs> no i mean no questions <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ross wishes part i to be interpreted as placing a general duty on the secretary of state and others to protect conserve and improve the environment <e> <s> those are worthy sentiments but the amendment itself is unnecessary <e> <s> the amendment gives me the opportunity to make categorically clear that the purpose of the environmental protection bill is indeed to protect the environment <e> <s> i am confident there is no possible room for doubt about that i can say that in part i of the bill we are introducing the most sophisticated pollution control system in europe <e>", "<cs> it is in a state of complete certainty that the noble lord lord mcintosh says that <e> <s> i reassure the committee that if the secretary of state speaking purely hypothetically were to act in any way other to promote the protection and improvement of the environment he would be acting beyond his powers and therefore unlawfully <e> <s> for those reasons we resist the amendment of the noble lord lord ross <e>", "<cs> i am happy to say that the government are already doing what the amendment <e>", "<cs> i take slight issue with the noble lord lord mcintosh about the last statement <e> <s> the white paper will be produced for everyone <e> <s> it is not being produced for the conservative party conference <e> <s> he quite rightly said that it was more my heart speaking than my experience in government <e> <s> i say to the noble lord that as he rightly pointed out earlier there are four secretaries of state involved with environmental questions and that is a minimum figure <e> <s> having seen what is involved in producing a white paper where there are a minimum of four departments concerned providing a useful document every six months on the basis of what four departments can agree among themselves will not i suspect give the benefit that the promoters of this amendment expect <e>", "<cs> the proposal of the noble lord lord ross to establish an environmental audit commission was made in another place <e> <s> on that occasion the amendment was a probing one <e>", "<cs> i believe that this amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> well before the six-month period which has been set details of the first two categories of processes specified in this amendment will have been published <e> <s> the government have already given clear indications most recently in the draft schedule made available during the committee stage of this bill in another place of the range of industrial processes that we intend to bring under part i control <e> <s> we have announced that we intend to publish draft regulations setting out the complete list of processes and substances by the end of july <e> <s> we intend to publish the six-month regulations shortly after royal assent and certainly within the six-month period suggested <e> <s> these will specify those processes which are to come under integrated pollution control and all of those which are to come over a period of time under local authority control for air pollution purposes <e>", "<cs> i fear that the degree of positiveness required by the noble lord lord williams of elvel in order to satisfy his desire not to return to this matter at report stage will be beyond my abilities <e>", "<cs> that is what i might term a departmental colloquialism <e> <s> in addition the uk is a signatory to the sofia nox protocol of the unece convention on transboundary air pollution <e> <s> under this protocol we are

local authorities are equally determined to make progress with the new air pollution control regime established under this part of the bill as shown through their contribution to the committee already set up to co-ordinate enforcement of the new controls and to the drafting of local authority guidance notes aimed at ensuring consistency of enforcement practice <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has explained his case for requiring that those authorised to carry on a part i process should pay a sum of money to the enforcing authority before commencing operations <e> <s> this would be repaid upon completion of a programme of works designed to prevent pollution <e> <s> i confess that i am not completely clear how the system would work in practice <e> <s> how for example would it affect the vast

first categorically reassure him that it is no part of our purpose to place unnecessary bureaucracy or unwarranted obstacles in the way of industry <e> <s> i fully appreciate that the system we are proposing in part i must allow industry the greatest liberty consistent with adequate environmental control to get on with the task of producing the goods on which they and all of us depend <e> <s> and i am very alive to the need to ensure that the system of variations which clause proposes should reflect the operational requirements of industry as well as those of the enforcing authority <e>

which served it should be liable to pay compensation <e> <s> i recognise that the service of a revocation notice will be a matter of the utmost importance to the operator of a prescribed process but i

brings to the attention of your lordships house two important points first that in the drought the greatest problems were found by those authorities which depended more on reservoirs than on bore-holes and secondly that east anglia is very flat and as a result the attraction of reservoirs less than in other areas <e>", "<cs> my lords the biggest influence on the level of the water table is the level of rainfall and not abstraction <e> <s> where i live there are no bore-holes at all but the water table has fallen precipitately entirely due to the low level of rainfall <e>", "<cs> my

noble lord would have accepted with glee <e>", "<cs> in reply for the second time to the noble lord i shall again take his words and point out that we are committed to providing the guidance in order

stimulate the recycling industry <e> <s> it is not our intention to regulate for the sake of regulation <e> <s> but we must also be sure that any operations involving waste are not a threat to the environment <e> <s> many operations involving the recovery of scrap metal can present such a threat for example through the breaking of equipment <e> <s> it must also not be possible for the unscrupulous to avoid legitimate controls by describing waste as destined for recycling when they have no intention of recycling it <e> <s> such a loophole would result in an increase in fly-tipping

rightly makes each person bear his share of responsibility <e> <s> it applies to all people whenever they have control of the waste itself <e> <s> we believe that that is the best and most satisfactory way of achieving the objective <e> <s> that is why we resist the noble lords amendment <e>", "<cs> i certainly would not want to make a political point <e> <s> we believe equally in the

here <e> <s> the first as i stated earlier is that the introduction of the charges should in the long-term be beneficial <e> <s> secondly there is a slight assumption in the noble lords scenario that

anything from the past is not covered <e> <s> i disagree <e> <s> there is in existence waste which is already covered <e> <s> we are improving the system for the future <e> <s> the noble lord is turning to the government not for the first time and not for the first time during the proceedings on this bill and saying that this should be treated entirely as a separate issue even if it has an historical background <e>", "<cs> i am in no position this evening to be able to judge the position in west yorkshire <e> <s> but i am more than happy to write to the noble lord in the light of the remarks he has made and the example he has given and see whether i can satisfy his worries on that front <e>", "<cs> i shall speak first to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> this amendment would remove

had very different views on the future career of their offspring <e> <s> i cannot accept either view of the existing subsection c of clause and it will not come as a surprise to anyone that i am firmly of the opinion that the drafting is just right as it stands <e>", "<cs> the amendments in the name of the noble lord lord gisborough are seeking to create complete discretion for local authorities to set their own charges <e> <s> i fear that the government cannot accept that <e> <s> national identical charges are an essential pillar of our charging proposals for reasons that i shall explain <e>", "<cs> i sympathise with the intention underlying this amendment although i have to say at once that i cannot accept it <e>", "<cs> i have to say at once that i have every sympathy with the purpose of this amendment and if it were a realistic possibility i should be delighted to accept it <e> <s> of course we all want appeals to be determined quickly <e> <s> i accept that my departments record has not been of the swiftest but legislating in this way is not going to help unless it is a practical proposition to deliver appeal decisions without exception within six months <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord has made a remarkable omission <e> <s> many local authority officials around the country would tell him that increasingly planning committees take a very different view to that recommended to them by their officials <e> <s> it is a growing problem at marsham street <e> <s> it has nothing to do with the resources of central government <e> <s> it is the reality of a presumption against development in all its facets <e> <s> that is human nature <e> <s> i do not believe that the noble lord expects me to put amendments in the bill to legislate for human nature <e>", "<cs> i feel that i can make little extra useful contribution to the matter apart from pointing out to the noble lord that we are talking about two entirely different matters <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> would impose a duty on contractors operating civic amenity sites to make a charge for waste deposited unlawfully at their sites by commercial operators <e> <s> operators already have the power to charge for commercial waste deposited at their sites <e> <s> indeed apart from a requirement that they should not charge for household waste operators are free to decide on their own charging policies <e> <s> i am also concerned that the amendment may give rise to the belief that it is acceptable unlawfully to deposit waste at a civic amenity site provided that you pay the operator of that site <e> <s> let me make it clear that sites must accept only the waste that they are licensed to accept <e> <s> there can be no question of site operators being paid to <e>", "<cs> we are again indebted to my noble friend lord balfour for his sharp-sighted detection of some unnecessary repetition and i am happy to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord feels that the answer is similar to an earlier one <e> <s> but it was a similar question and that is why he received a similar answer <e> <s> he will not be <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord rightly said there has been a considerable increase in the level of expenditure <e> <s> it would be difficult to return to the treasury to ask for a further draw-down on resources of about million which is the sum that has been referred to <e> <s> we are not talking about cancellations but about early completions <e>", "<cs> my lords i return to the answer that i gave the noble lord lord northfield <e> <s> the reality is that there has been an increase in the number of completions <e> <s> that is the important point <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is attempting to broaden the question beyond the housing associations to local authority-provided housing <e> <s> as i have pointed out on two occasions already on this question we are not talking about a reduction in the number of houses but about a reduction in the amount of cash available because <e>", "<cs> my lords i remind the noble lord that the problems are brought about essentially by success and not by disaster <e> <s> if more money is spent with the result that more houses are provided sooner fewer houses will be built later <e> <s> but the actual net effect should not be any different from that which was originally planned <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said to the noble lord lord northfield earlier the sum of money that has been mentioned for this year is million and not million <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly draw the remarks of the noble lord on the price of land to the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that that is applicable not only to my own department but to many other departments <e> <s> it would result in the unbelievable situation of sympathy being shown to the treasury <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> in reply to the noble earl lord shannon i should like to begin by paying tribute to the valuable contributions that he has made in recent months to stimulating debate and raising informed interest in waste issues <e> <s> we had a long and serious debate on the noble earls motion on th may after my honourable friend the minister of state took part in a stimulating seminar on waste which was held in your lordships house on rd april <e>", "<cs> i believe that my noble friend is referring to the funding of the afrc research in this field <e> <s> i am very glad that he drew it to the attention of the committee <e>", "<cs> the amendment of the noble lord lord rcss amendment no <e> <s> raises an issue of fundamental importance <e> <s> there is no point in collecting and processing recyclable waste if there is no end market <e> <s> as he rightly pointed out all you get are soggy stockpiles of newspapers and can and glass mountains <e> <s> you also get many disheartened consumers who see their efforts to segregate waste literally going to waste <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord ross responds perhaps i could draw my noble friends attention to the proposed plant in kent <e> <s> the key problem regarding newsprint is not a question of subsidy or financial encouragement it is the physical availability of the plant to process the soggy pile of paper about which my noble friend is concerned <e> <s> one hopes that when the plant is completed there will be capacity in excess of the available market which will result not merely in an underpinning but an increase in the price in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> disregarding the treasury and the recycling credit amendments which come later we have touched on the importance of getting the market right for recycled materials <e> <s> there are always ways of helping the market along and the system of recycling credits which we hope to introduce through a later amendment will we hope do just that <e> <s> we can help through changing public procurement policies and other such measures <e> <s> i am pleased to tell the committee that the department of the environment is continuing to pay a reasonable premium for recycled paper and to review its policy on specifying materials in order to favour recycled goods <e> <s> we very much hope that other public bodies and private companies will adopt a similar policy of positive discrimination <e>", "<cs> i do not have the specific answer to my noble friends point <e> <s> i can assure him that if it is satisfactory i shall write to him immediately after this debate with the answer <e>", "<cs> i apologise for the confusion and the delay in answering <e> <s> it was entirely my fault <e> <s> i thought that my noble friend lord reay was attending to this amendment but i realise that i am responsible <e> <s> i humbly request the forgiveness of your lordships committee and also of my colleague the noble lord lord reay who was confused <e> <s> he thought that i thought that he was dealing with the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady nicol has proposed a resource tax with the intention of minimising the waste that we have to dispose of <e> <s> she hopes that by making it more expensive to use virgin raw materials people will use less of them and that they will switch to using recycled raw materials <e> <s> she intends too that the beneficiary of the tax will be the waste regulation authorities although she does not say what those small bodies would do with the large sums of money that could be generated by even a minimal tax applied throughout the uk industry <e>", "<cs> i am pleased that the noble lord lord mcintosh takes an interest on behalf of the contractors and believes it possible that the contractors might lose out <e> <s> there may well be circumstances in which it is preferable from both the authorities and the contractors points of view for them to come to some arrangement lease or rental agreement over certain essentially capital equipment <e> <s> that is the object of the exercise <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that there is no hidden scheme arriving at this point in the bill <e>", "<cs> the noble lord may say that he did not receive an answer <e> <s> i thought that i gave him a fairly specific answer to his question <e> <s> i think that he is trying to over-complicate what is quite a sinple issue <e>", "<cs> it was interesting that the noble lord said that we should end up paying subsidies <e> <s> when replying to the noble lords earlier amendment i referred not to the market but to the command economy as i saw it <e> <s> the noble lord lord mcintosh referred to the word subsidy <e> <s> whatever financial return or benefit accrues it accrues within the waste itself <e> <s> it is not as in the amendment of the noble lord extra cash coming in from outside in order to try to rig the market <e> <s> it is an internal transaction and keeps within the policy of the loop which i outlined earlier to the committee of trying to create improvement and achievement within the system rather than that coming in from outside <e>", "<cs> i do not disagree with the noble lord in saying that whatever system one tries to employ in order to encourage recycling will have difficulties <e> <s> i should be the first to admit that there will always be difficulties when we try to achieve what we set out to do <e>", "<cs> i welcome the comments made by the noble lord lord ross of newport <e> <s> i point out to the noble baroness lady phillips that he was right in saying that the amendment fulfils a promise made in another place <e> <s> it is a comparatively modest amendment compared with those that i have seen tabled on occasions by members on the other side of the committee in an attempt to change the course of various bills <e>", "<cs> amendments nos <e> <s> to standing in the name of the noble duke the duke of somerset the noble lords lord mcnair and lord st john of bletso and my noble friend lord sudeley seek to establish precisely the sort of recycling credits scheme about which i spoke at some length a little earlier <e> <s> we are at one in the desire to see a clearly understood methodology for establishing the cost savings made by avoiding landfill in favour of recycling <e>", "<cs> it has a broad mind which is why we are waiting to know the views of those who have something to contribute to the debate <e>", "<cs> i am once again grateful for an intervention of my noble friend lord renton <e> <s> in many ways there are similarities between this amendment and the amendment i moved earlier <e> <s> i shall look forward with interest to the finer and more technical amendments that the noble lord lord mcnair foreshadowed in his remarks <e>", "<cs> i have the utmost respect for the valuable contribution made by the noble lord lord ezra to recycling policy as chairman of the uk reclamation council <e> <s> when he enters a special plea on behalf of the recycling industry we do well to listen <e> <s> we sometimes hear special pleadings that seem to be suggesting that any industry engaged in reclamation and any material destined for recycling are inherently a good thing and should therefore be exempted from every control or regulation known to man <e> <s> the noble lord is far too experienced and knowledgeable to fall into such exaggeration <e> <s> this proposed new clause is moderate and reasonable in its demands <e> <s> indeed it is so reasonable that i hope to be able to demonstrate to the noble lord that all its essential points are already met in the bill as it stands <e>", "<cs> i fully understand the anxiety of the noble lord lord graham and his desire to put the words methane gas on the face of the bill <e> <s> pure methane gas may be colourless and odourless <e> <s> however it is the potential danger against which we want to protect ourselves and the environment <e> <s> that gas is flammable and can form explosive mixtures which in my mind means that it is potentially damaging to the environment and to those persons living in it <e> <s> hence the word noxious which according to my dictionary means hurtful and must include such a substance <e>", "<cs> there is general recognition that we need a proper basis for tackling the problems of <e>", "<cs> this group of amendments introduces two issues who should undertake the legal works and who should pay for them <e> <s> i have to say that these issues have been the subject of more soul-searching and scrutiny in my department over the past few months than any other in part ii <e> <s> we are not unaware of the difficulties but have concluded that the course we have chosen with crucial government amendments yet to be discussed is right <e>", "<cs> i understand what the noble lord lord mcintosh says but i am interested to know <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may draw the noble lords attention to the remarks that i made earlier in reply to the amendment tabled by the noble lord lord layton which referred to cases where the authority has the right to retrieve from those who are the polluters <e> <s> the examples that i gave involved cases where the polluter had disappeared <e> <s> that is why we must protect the innocent parties <e>", "<cs> i shall be interested to hear the noble lord when he presents his amendment at report stage <e>", "<cs> these amendments are a lawyers paradise <e> <s> in this clause we are dealing with waste that is not controlled waste <e> <s> unless this clause provides otherwise none of the controlled waste regime elsewhere in this part applies to what i shall term non-controlled waste <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord addington for again raising this matter which is of great concern to us all <e> <s> the amendment gives me the opportunity to restate the governments policy in relation to the disposal of clinical waste and how its safe disposal is addressed by the provisions contained within the bill <e> <s> clinical waste may not be only offensive in nature it can also carry with it a high risk of infection <e> <s> inadequacies in the management of clinical waste have led to a number of incidents which have aroused public anxiety and it is perfectly proper to consider how far this might require amendment to the bill <e>", "<cs> i must tell the noble lord that if he visits his local surgery he will see that there are special bags which are used for this purpose and they are given special disposal treatment <e>", "<cs> the amendment tackles the difficult question of the definition of waste <e> <s> it is a difficult area to define one mans waste is anothers raw material <e> <s> when does an article that one person wishes to discard become something that another person wants <e> <s> it might be thought that it is at <e>", "<cs> the definitions in the bill are entirely compatible with the ec directives <e> <s> that being the case and if all others follow the ec directives a satisfactory result should ensue <e>", "<cs> i suggest that factory farming is probably a colloquialism <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that the noble lord will be entirely satisfied with my answer <e> <s> it will be a kind of reverse negative there were exemptions in an earlier part of the bill and that which would be considered as waste in many areas in farming would probably be considered beneficial <e> <s> as a typical example chicken muck resulting from intensive farming of chickens which is put back on to the land is seen in some quarters as for the public good in organic terms <e>", "<cs> the advice which i received is very similar to the advice that i have just given to the noble lord namely that if the processes fall within the factories act they come under the industrial part of the amendment as referred to earlier <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble lord lord ross that import and export read much better than the current text of the bill which refers to importation and exportation <e> <s> however i regret that i cannot accept these amendments <e> <s> the use of importation and exportation is necessary for historical reasons <e> <s> the customs and excise management act which has effect for the purposes of the customs and excise acts and other enactments refers to the importation and exportation of goods <e> <s> so for example the timing of importation is deemed to be when in the case of goods brought by sea the ship bringing them comes within the limits of a port <e> <s> the act also refers to exportation rather than export <e> <s> i am advised that were we to refer to import and export in these clauses we would run the risk of casting doubt as to whether we meant the same thing as importation and exportation and therefore break the link with customs and excise legislation <e> <s> we cannot afford to do that <e> <s> therefore somewhat against my limited linguistic preferences i ask the noble lord not to press these amendments <e>", "<cs> i must point out that the clause under consideration deals with the importation use supply or storage of injurious substances or articles and does not deal with wastes <e> <s> that is the subject of the following clause clause <e> <s> nevertheless i shall try to deal with the points made in relation to that clause and to explain the governments policy on trade in waste which will set the scene for several of the debates on later amendments <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for drawing attention to many places in which the drafting of the bill may be improved <e> <s> however on this occasion i must respectfully point out that the drafting of the clause is indeed correct <e>", "<cs> merely for the sake of clarity i should like to point out that again we have an amendment put down for clause which rightly <e>", "<cs> the basle convention prohibits trade between non-signatories except through bilateral arrangements <e> <s> we would require these points to be included in any bilateral arrangement <e> <s> as regards the specific example of the united states i shall have to write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> we have debated several times over the past few days the governments views on the status of recyclable waste <e> <s> in response to amendments seeking to remove recyclable waste from controls i made clear that the governments first responsibility in this area is the protection of the environment <e> <s> since it is quite clear the processing of recyclable waste can pose as much an environmental risk as its disposal we have given our assurances that there can be no exclusions from the definition of waste itself <e> <s> the definitions in the bill both in part ii and in this clause do not exclude recyclable material from the definition of waste <e> <s> therefore we believe that there is no need for this amendment <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord will appreciate that we are moving into a slightly difficult transitional period <e> <s> there is an ec overlay to all this <e> <s> effectively there are three levels the bill before your lordships committee the basle convention and the example of a non-ratifying signatory and ec regulations which may not make uk regulations redundant but may overtake them <e> <s> that is the difficulty about saying that we wish to have a uk initiative which is what i believe the noble lord suggests <e> <s> that is different from what is proposed on a broader scale <e>", "<cs> there would be nothing wrong in drawing attention to what the noble lord has to say in order to put in that equation <e> <s> the points he has made this evening on that are relevant <e>", "<cs> it is our intention that wastes should not be brought to this country for disposal unless there are very good reasons for it <e> <s> uppermost in our minds is that a country may not have disposal facilities of its own and since it is in the best interests of the world environment that wastes should be disposed of to the highest standards available they may need to be brought to this country <e>", "<cs> on a previous amendment of the noble lord lord mcintosh and on a preceding amendment of the noble lord lord layton we discussed the relationship between the united states and this country and the relationship between those who are signatories to the basle convention and those who have ratified the convention <e> <s> i hope that <e>", "<cs> i cannot see that it would serve any useful purpose for there to be a national audit to determine the amount of special waste that is produced in the united kingdom <e> <s> i use the words special waste in preference to the words toxic waste not to score a cheap point but because special waste is the term used in this bill and in the control of pollution act before it to denote waste which is dangerous or difficult to dispose of <e> <s> i believe it is helpful to those who will read the record of this debate to use the words that are defined elsewhere in the bill <e>", "<cs> this amendment has a long history <e> <s> it was back in the early s that the science and technology committee of this house first recommended that the producers of hazardous waste should be registered with the local authority <e> <s> another recommendation made at the same time was for the licensing of waste carriers and last week we debated that point in connection with clause <e>", "<cs> i wish that i could give my noble friend lord renton a clear and certain answer <e> <s> in a way the answer is partly yes and partly no <e> <s> when we debated amendments to part i of the bill certain amendments made direct reference to co <e>", "<cs> i think it would be fair to say that part iii is consistent with part i of the bill <e> <s> on the matter of whether or not it is in aid of part i of the bill i defer to my noble friends superior understanding of these matters <e> <s> it is also important to remember that we tabled a consistent number of amendments with regard to motor vehicles and large power stations in part i of the bill <e>", "<cs> the working party on the department of the environments review of noise has recommended that action should be taken to clarify the duty on local authorities <e> <s> the government are favourably disposed to the amendments in principle but believe that consultation with local authorities and other organisations is necessary <e> <s> we shall be consulting shortly and if the response supports the intention behind the amendments we shall return with an amendment at a later date <e> <s> i therefore hope that the noble lard will not press his amendments <e>", "<cs> clauses and provide that it shall be a defence to prove that the best practicable means have been used to prevent or to counteract the effects of a nuisance <e> <s> this defence is available in the case of nuisances arising on industrial trade or business premises and smoke nuisances arising from chimney emissions <e>", "<cs> i covered that point earlier in referring to the remarks of the noble lord lord parry <e> <s> the tidy britain group has represented the frontier for the government in that respect <e> <s> it has designated as tidy britain year and in the past two years has been in receipt of some million which has been spent in a variety of ways which the group has considered the best in order to achieve exactly what the noble lord lord graham proposed <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> b is concerned with the position of authorities who had already entered into agreements for street and other cleaning services under the terms of the competitive tendering legislation before the new duties on local authorities and the standards set for performance come into force <e>", "<cs> competitive tendering provides a level playing field <e> <s> technically an authority cannot have a contract with itself

mcintosh is wrong <e> <s> however there is no contract <e> <s> the tender is entirely different from the principle of legal contract <e> <s> if the dso tender is successful the performance of the work is governed by the provisions of the local government act section <e> <s> that is what the government have said <e> <s> that is not a contract it does not exist with an outside contractor <e>", "<cs> i understand what the noble baroness is saying but it is not possible for any government minister to stand at the dispatch box and loosely bandy around such words <e> <s> the fact is that in one case a contract exists and in the other case it does not because it is covered by a separate section of the act <e>", "<cs> it will enable transfer orders to be made in cases where it appears to the secretary of state to be expedient as well as in those where he considers it to be necessary <e> <s> circumstances where the making of an order would be expedient though perhaps it could be argued not

draw the noble lords remarks to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government are concerned about the quality of statistics and have taken steps to make improvements <e> <s> following the pickford review of economic statistics the central statistical office has been enlarged and reorganised and the pickford proposals for improvements have been implemented <e>", "<cs> my lords to complement the pickford proposals and to focus on areas of greatest concern the chancellor of the exchequer announced in may a further package of measures aimed at improving the quality of statistics on services companies and the balance of payments <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to admit to your lordships house that i am not aware of the specific figures to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> however i shall certainly check them <e>", "<cs> my lords the government feel as strongly as anyone that we must constantly be reviewing the production of our statistics <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that the noble lord lord stallard has misinterpreted the meaning of my words <e> <s> i referred to reviewing the collation of statistics to improve the output of the statistics rather than a review of the statistics in the manner that he suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that on my first occasion answering treasury questions it is of great elucidation to have been in receipt of the advice of the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the first part of the noble lords question i refer back to my original answer <e> <s> he has referred entirely to the past <e> <s> in my original answer i pointed to changes that took place as a result of the pickford committee and to further changes after that <e> <s> statistics are called statistics and not facts because they can occasionally be wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall make a statement on sterlings entry into the exchange rate mechanism <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall attempt to be brief <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce of donington raised the point also raised by the noble lord lord ezra regarding the governments intentions <e> <s> the governments intentions could not be more clearly stated than by the fact of our having gone into the erm <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the noble lords connection with the report and that his knowledge of these matters is considerably greater than mine <e> <s> i also point out that the decision was eventually taken in a positive way and i believe in a beneficial way for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the remarks of my noble friend <e> <s> i should like to draw to the attention of your lordships one salient point that he made <e> <s> a strong currency is no bad thing <e> <s> it is worth remembering that the west german economy has not suffered by reason of having a strong currency <e> <s> my noble friend is also correct to make the other points that he did regarding the future <e> <s> i am grateful for all that he said <e>", "<cs> my lords as i remarked to the noble lord lord jenkins when i saw him earlier today my first reading before coming to the house today was his own article which appeared yesterday in the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord barnett engages in that attractive practice of hoping that there is a fixed answer to a fixed point on a future timescale and on which the government are willing to tie their neck and arms <e> <s> however i must counter the first point made by the noble lord concerning madrid <e> <s> the conditions of madrid mostly have been met in regard to the free movement of capital the single market competition policy and the liberalisation of financial services <e> <s> i believe that it is generally accepted when one speaks to many businesses across many fronts that there has been a reduction in the volume of business <e> <s> as i pointed out earlier there has been a reduction in inflation of a substantial nature in various areas be it on new construction orders housing costs motor car sales the list goes on <e> <s> those figures give the government confidence that inflation is coming down <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for her remarks <e> <s> she is right to draw to the <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the demands and conditions referred to by the noble lord lord stoddart to be perfectly frank he would be better off asking thomas more <e> <s> with regard to the further stages of the emu i made it quite clear in making the statement that alternatives lie ahead and that the first discussion of those will be at the intergovernmental conference in december <e> <s> therefore the position is not cast in stone and i cannot give him a reply which is hand-chiselled into timber <e>", "<cs> my lords on the basis of the reception of the governments decision over a very wide front i believe that there is broad acceptance of it <e> <s> however the fact that we intended to enter the erm at a suitable time was made clear by the chancellor of the exchequer long before the summer recess <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lords party had been in power as recently as there would have been no possibility of this country joining the erm in any circumstances <e> <s> the previous labour administration had the opportunity to take this country into the erm before <e>", "<cs> my lords he wrote a book called <e>", "<cs> my lords i assume that the noble lord is suggesting that rather than showing ability in anticipation we should await reaction and not become a member of the erm <e> <s> that is the position on which he stands at the moment <e> <s> the chancellor believes that inflation is falling substantially and in line with what we required at madrid as i have said on a number of occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i am correct in saying that the labour government were opposed to joining <e>", "<cs> my lords if one looks at the figures in constant prices in the figure was per cent <e> <s> and in it was per cent <e> <s> however it is also worth remembering that during the previous three-month period exports rose year on year by some per cent <e> <s> against imports which rose by per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords that is wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> i should be more than happy to answer if the noble lord lord taylor would care to table a question <e>", "<cs> my lords i like to think that not only do the germans work very hard but that your lordships house does so too <e>", "<cs> my lords i assure the noble lord lord bruce that the figures i originally quoted are entirely accurate <e> <s> as i am sure many noble lords are aware the difficulty is that there are many different columns and we could enter into a lengthy but perhaps not entirely constructive debate <e> <s> i return to the figures i quoted which i believe to be entirely accurate <e> <s> they related to the export of goods and services as a percentage of gnp but the noble lord disagreed with what i said <e> <s> the figure i have for is per cent <e> <s> and that for is per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords stone does not have the property of being able to be flexible by per cent <e> <s> up or down <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my statement on monday the erm will impose a discipline on the british manufacturing industry whereby it cannot look to price inflation to save the day <e> <s> i am interested to note that within four days of our joining the erm the benches opposite are deciding whether they are happy with the rate at which we entered <e>", "<cs> my lords of course my noble friend is entirely correct because exports are not able to indulge in the same inflationary activities as occur in the domestic market <e> <s> if domestic inflation is stripped out the story as regards our exports over the s is one of stability <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for the intervention by the noble earl because i believe that we are falling into some confusion with the comparative figures of only one of those three components which he mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am referring to figures which are drawn from official sources <e> <s> if i am wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lord lord ezra makes a good point <e> <s> however i am not sure that that is entirely within the confines of this question <e> <s> if he wishes to table a question i shall be more than happy to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords i like to think that on the basis of monday with the result of the pickford committee and further commitments made by the chancellor if the noble baronesss suggestions are correct rectification is already under way <e>", "<cs> my lords to answer the noble lords last question first i am surprised to see that a supporter of his party is already flinching on the subject of the erm <e> <s> the evidence is that the trade figures that arrived yesterday were the lowest for three years <e> <s> when that is combined with the more interesting figure which shows that for the quarter the volume of car exports rose by per cent <e> <s> it will be seen that the trend is in the right direction <e>", "<cs> my lords it is particularly true that during a period of restructuring in british manufacturing the city of london has made an enormous contribution to the exports of this country both visible and invisible <e> <s> it is also important to remember that in the past months the increase in the rate of exports was the highest since <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord barnett asks an interesting question <e> <s> the governments policy is to curb inflation so that a beneficial effect will occur throughout the economy <e>", "<cs> my lords the volume of exports less oil erratics rose by per cent <e> <s> on the previous year <e>", "<cs> my lords the volume between quarter two and quarter three fell by the difference between billion and billion <e> <s> i do not know whether that constitutes per cent <e> <s> i believe it is slightly less <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bruce will use good news as well as bad news to support his claim that the british economy is in terminal decline <e> <s> i resist that claim <e> <s> to give one <e>", "<cs> my lords in the figure i mentioned earlier car imports into the united kingdom fell by per cent <e> <s> at the same time as car exports rose by per cent <e> <s> clearly a reduction in home demand contributed to that figure <e> <s> we believe that a reduction in demand is essential to a reduction in inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords my education did not provide me with the benefit of producing the exact percentage of the differential between the two <e> <s> i suspect that it is a small figure whichever it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that your lordships house will be grateful to know that it will not be in my hands but those of the chancellor <e> <s> however the instruments are already being used to reduce inflation and to continue to make the united kingdom an attractive investment opportunity for outside capital <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord donoughue asks three questions none of which appears on the order paper <e> <s> i point out to him that both japan and germany have not done too badly with a high and strong currency <e>", "<cs> my lords net privatisation proceeds in the years to amounted to billion <e> <s> north sea oil revenues over the same period totalled billion <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to disagree with the noble lord lord dean <e> <s> the opportunity to achieve those finances was available if a previous government had decided to engage in a policy of privatisation <e> <s> perhaps i may take two figures <e> <s> it is worth remembering that expenditure both on the health service and on social security has increased by one-third in real terms during that time <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have a figure for the reduction in the national debt <e> <s> however i can tell my noble friend that the public sector borrowing requirement in was some billion which is the equivalent of billion today <e> <s> the current figure for public sector debt reduction is some billion for <e>", "<cs> my lords there appears to be a view that north sea oil is different to any other form of revenue <e> <s> however in my dealings with the treasury i have found that revenue is revenue <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bruce goes rather wider than my brief <e> <s> i fear that the noble lord also assumes the best figure on the best day <e> <s> it is worth remembering that the oil price in mid-july was dollars and cents a barrel <e> <s> it rose to dollars and cents a barrel on th october and is trailing today at dollars and cents a barrel <e> <s> i do not believe that that will equate to an extra billion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the leader of the opposition for drawing that fact to my attention <e> <s> i should point out that we have a commitment in the gulf <e> <s> that commitment will cost a great deal of money but at this moment it is hard to put a price on it <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lord is suggesting that those prices will hold for months <e> <s> i believe that there is no evidence to suggest that that is the case <e>", "<cs> my lords the negotiations have identified the main difficulties as being the scope of the directive its interaction with other safety directives the additional burdens imposed on business and the handling of safety emergencies at a community level <e> <s> it must be said that although steady progress continues to be made all of those issues remain to be resolved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the commendation from my noble friend as regards the governments achievements in this area in brussels <e>", "<cs> my lords since taking up my new position as the minister responsible for consumer affairs some weeks ago i have met with a number of consumer groups which have all drawn that point to my attention <e> <s> as usual the scrutiny committee provided the house with a full and detailed report which has been fully taken into account as the negotiations progress <e> <s> we also need to consider the views expressed when the directive was debated in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the italian presidency is talking about holding the next meeting in december <e> <s> the noble baroness will be aware that the united kingdom is a leader in consumer advocacy <e> <s> however there are other partners who must be party to any progress <e> <s> much as the united kingdom likes to take a lead there is no possibility of encouragement by diktat <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the joys of living in our country is that anyone who chooses to do so may be a representative of consumer affairs <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by taking this opportunity at the dispatch box to welcome the arrival of the noble lord lord peston as my interrogator on a regular basis for the foreseeable future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always rather uncertain about higher education qualifications but i believe that the expression refers primarily to qualifications gained in universities and polytechnics <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly bring the last remarks of my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter to the attention of the right honourable member for kingston upon thames <e> <s> the figure that my noble friend requires is per cent <e> <s> which includes local authority expenditure <e> <s> he drew out the crucial difference between the two sides facing each other across this dispatch box <e> <s> we believe that the private sector is the engine of growth which pulls the train that delivers a better society <e> <s> we do not believe that the better society should be the engine that destroys the engine behind <e>", "<cs> my lords we return to statistics <e> <s> no doubt the noble lord lord bruce who i anticipated even from his new position would continue to harry me in my new position would be surprised if at this dispatch box i decided to change the prediction in the statement that was made by the chancellor <e> <s> i can draw to his attention the fact that export volumes achieved this year have risen <e> <s> as i pointed out to him the other day in vehicle production which is an area that a decade ago many had given up as lost forever they have been rising most encouragingly <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not go beyond the position that we predicted <e> <s> i shall have to stand my ground at that point <e>", "<cs> my lords as always my noble friend lord jenkin of roding makes an extremely fine point <e> <s> i am certain that if those operations were still being run in the public sector there would be tens of billions of pounds above the tens of billions to which he has drawn attention <e>", "<cs> my lords if i could and i did i might be in rather serious trouble <e> <s> in order to lower interest rates we have to destroy inflation <e> <s> that is what this government are engaged in <e>", "<cs> my lords that will not be the case if they use the uk-direct service <e> <s> however i shall draw the noble lords question to the attention of british telecom <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised that the noble lord lord donoughue asks that question because with his knowledge of the treasury am sure that he is aware that the treasury does not forecast unemployment <e> <s> however it is fair to say that with the desire to reduce inflation the economy has slowed <e> <s> therefore there must be an assumption that there is a possible increase in unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lords first question it is right to remember that interest rates were universally cut in many countries after the stock market crash of <e> <s> it is worth remembering that the labour party said that those rates had not been cut sufficiently quickly <e> <s> it is worth remembering also that we now have an economy which in the third quarter of has manufacturing output at a record level <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lords first point i am sure that your lordships house will be very grateful that i did not complete the essay to which he referred particularly at question time <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have always maintained that those who are weakest in society are those who are poorest and on fixed incomes <e> <s> they are the greatest victims of inflation <e> <s> the governments policy is to curb inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords i must repeat to the noble lord the leader of the opposition what i said earlier <e> <s> we believe that the greatest evil of all is inflation and that must be tackled <e> <s> there is a price to be paid for tackling inflation but inflation must be conquered <e>", "<cs> my lords the tables before me show that the figures for the third quarter of were per cent <e> <s> higher than those for the previous peak year which was <e>", "<cs> my lords i am answering on behalf of the government and not the <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of all members of your lordships house i am sorry that the noble viscount lord st davids will not be attending the debate this afternoon <e> <s> however i cannot agree with his proposition <e>", "<cs> my lords we forecast that in our battle to control inflation there will be a slow-down in the economy <e> <s> that leads to the assumption that there could possibly be an increase in unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that there may be disagreement over which set of tables and figures is being used <e> <s> however if the noble lord is correct i shall write to him <e> <s> we could finish up in a complicated argument regarding which set of figures is being used by whom and for what <e>", "<cs> my lords i was in no way surprised by the speech of the noble baroness lady castle of blackburn <e> <s> i mean that in the most complimentary manner <e> <s> i was expecting a superb performance <e> <s> your lordships house was well rewarded and its chalice overflowed <e> <s> i cannot wait to see the noble baroness when she is really in high dudgeon <e>", "<cs> i turn now to the subject of economic and monetary union <e> <s> i shall limit myself to a few observations since we shall be debating that important subject at much greater length next wednesday <e> <s> on economic and monetary union the government continue to play an active and a positive part in discussions a fact which some commentators seem strangely to have ignored <e> <s> perhaps they have been dazzled by the brilliance of the federalists rhetoric for they certainly cannot have been looking at the substance <e> <s> others may have made grandiose statements <e> <s> the uk has made concrete proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord jay will not be surprised when i say that i am unable to comment on his allegations <e>", "<cs> my lords as always i am most interested in the noble baronesss questions <e> <s> however i must point out that her questions especially the latter one are wide of the question on the order paper which specifically refers to the monopolies and mergers commission <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness will not be surprised to learn that i do not have the actual day and specific time in this respect <e> <s> however i am reliably informed that it will be within the next months <e>", "<cs> my lords the relationship between the two companies and their employees is a matter for them it is not a matter for the government <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the prime minister did not inform the secretary of state for trade and industry about her meeting with mr murdoch <e> <s> on the only occasion that mr murdoch tried to speak to the secretary of state he was not available <e>", "<cs> my lords a large number of people constantly visit downing street <e>", "<cs> my lords i gave that answer in order to be helpful to the noble baroness <e> <s> in my first reply to her i pointed out that her question was wide of that on the order paper <e> <s> i was in receipt of information which i hoped would be or help to her <e> <s> i can go no further than the original answer i gave <e>", "<cs> my lords the agreement that the british government reached in with regard to british shipbuilders fell under the terms of the fifth directive on shipbuilding <e> <s> on st january the seventh directive on shipbuilding comes into effect <e> <s> the purpose of the directives is to reduce excessive merchant shipbuilding capacity in europe <e> <s> if the government were to intervene that would be in direct <e>", "<cs> my lords on a day when i read in the <e>", "<cs> my lords the right reverend prelate specifically referred to an application to the commission <e> <s> i must point out to the noble lord that there are many other examples throughout europe <e> <s> that is why i quoted the percentages involved in the reduction in numbers employed in merchant shipbuilding and why we cannot go for a reapplication <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact of the matter is that under the agreement with the commission cammell laird was a warship yard <e> <s> the cmn yard referred to is a commercial and warship yard <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that we keep a close watching brief on our position and responsibilities in europe in regard to both our own activities and those of others <e> <s> it is important to understand that conditions of parallel existence do not pertain in these two cases <e> <s> cammell laird came out as a warship yard under our arrangements with the commission and arrangements differ from country to country on the basis of what they consider to be their priorities <e> <s> the cmn yard is a warship and commercial yard at that time cammell laird was not a commercial yard <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have numbers for the royal navy fleet in my hand or at my disposal <e> <s> it may be worth pointing out to your lordships house that under the commissions directive intervention is allowed in order to preserve warship capacity if it
