["<cs> my lords i should like to say one word if i may to underline very strongly what has been so well said about part ii of this bill <e> <s> i shall not elaborate on the arguments because they have been very well put in committee and at report stage as well as by the noble lord who has just spoken <e> <s> but i personally have very great concern lest we may in this part ii of the bill with the approved inspector system supported by an undefined and unworked out system of insurance be launching upon the public a regime of liability which will lead to considerable disappointment frustration and injustice <e> <s> all this will be in place of the existing system of liability at common law of building inspectors which has been worked out with great care by the courts and which with one exception namely that of latent damage which is under examination is working perfectly well and has not called for any substitution <e> <s> i feel very great concern that we shall be parting with that part of the bill without having given it and the proposed insurance scheme very careful parliamentary scrutiny <e> <s> i regret very much that that has happened <e>"]
