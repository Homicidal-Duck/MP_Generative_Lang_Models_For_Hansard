["<cs> my lords from these benches on which viscount dilhorne sat for a period of over years it is surely right that full concurrence and association should be expressed with the warm and merited tributes which have been paid <e> <s> he made very many notable contributions from this place to the business of this house and i know that many noble lords who sit in this part of the house would wish me to express on their behalf their gratitude for the very ready help and encouragement that he was always willing to give very often with a twinkle in his eye on matters of parliamentary procedure tactics and legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords would your lordships allow me to make a few observations on the bill before the noble and learned lord comes to reply <e> <s> i do apologise for not having put my name down to speak and for not having been present during the opening speeches <e> <s> the reason is that i and others of their lordships were engaged in urgent judicial business <e>", "<cs> my lords the hour is getting rather late so i hope your lordships will not think me discourteous if i cut short the compliments <e> <s> i am not going to bring within that self-denying ordinance the very sincere congratulations that i wish to pay to the noble viscount lord bledisloe for his excellent maiden speech <e> <s> i should like to assure him most sincerely that for us tired hacks on the judicial benches it is most refreshing and beneficial to hear the sane words of a practising barrister to keep our feet on the ground <e> <s> i hope he will come down here very often indeed to perform the same task <e>", "<cs> may i assure the noble baroness that speaking for this evening at any rate she has per cent <e> <s> support from the cross-benches <e>", "<cs> i would just like to add my support to the observations which have fallen from the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> there are important commercial interests involved in this clause which were fully discussed when the state immunity act was before this house <e> <s> at that time the government showed themselves to be very receptive indeed to the important city and banking interests which were involved and the act was substantially amended in order to meet the representations made by those concerned in those interests <e> <s> i feel sure that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor will be no less sympathetic to the same series of points which arise on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords at the report stage some complaint was made in a very good-tempered way but still it was made that at the discussions at that stage the house did not have the benefit of assistance from any of those of us who have some experience in legal matters <e> <s> the reason was simply this <e> <s> this amendment came in at a very late stage only at the report stage i am afraid it escaped the notice of myself and i think my colleagues and we were not alerted to it <e> <s> i felt that as a matter of courtesy at any rate one of us should be here today to give what help we can which will not be very great i am afraid as to the merits of the amendment proposed by the government and the new amendment proposed by the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say one word if i may to underline very strongly what has been so well said about part ii of this bill <e> <s> i shall not elaborate on the arguments because they have been very well put in committee and at report stage as well as by the noble lord who has just spoken <e> <s> but i personally have very great concern lest we may in this part ii of the bill with the approved inspector system supported by an undefined and unworked out system of insurance be launching upon the public a regime of liability which will lead to considerable disappointment frustration and injustice <e> <s> all this will be in place of the existing system of liability at common law of building inspectors which has been worked out with great care by the courts and which with one exception namely that of latent damage which is under examination is working perfectly well and has not called for any substitution <e> <s> i feel very great concern that we shall be parting with that part of the bill without having given it and the proposed insurance scheme very careful parliamentary scrutiny <e> <s> i regret very much that that has happened <e>", "<cs> i just want to raise one point for clarification <e> <s> i have probably completely missed the point and if so i ask the indulgence of the committee <e> <s> clause does not deal with parish charities it deals with local charities <e> <s> to find out what a local charity is one has to turn to clause <e>", "<cs> may i add a few words in support of what has been said <e> <s> we have already been told about the evershed committee and benson <e> <s> further weight is provided by a committee of justice report in which advocated a clause of this kind <e> <s> perhaps of more importance is the fact that it has been tried out in at least two states in australia new south wales <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i made a similar comment in <e>", "<cs> my lords may i seek the indulgence of your lordships to say a few words on this bill <e> <s> i apologise for not having put my name down to speak the reason being that i hopelessly underestimated and happily underestimated the recuperative powers of the noble and learned lord on the woolsack and thought that this bill would come for consideration at a later date <e>", "<cs> my lords with the deepest respect to my noble and learned friends and colleagues who have spoken i venture to suggest that we are in danger of making too much of a pother about this matter <e> <s> we had a great debate on second reading and points of view were expressed both ways <e> <s> the noble and learned lord on the woolsack said that he wished to take the case away and bring forward another clause <e> <s> he has brought another clause elaborately drafted in order to satisfy the objections made at the previous stage of the bill <e> <s> here we have it in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it is not what i would have chosen particularly because i happen to think that the proper route is quite a different one from that suggested in the bill <e> <s> nevertheless the noble and learned lord has as he said honoured his undertaking <e> <s> in one respect he has more than honoured it <e> <s> i do not feel that it is very profitable for us to be discussing in this forum the question of whether we are saving the time of one lord justice two lord justices or half a lord justice <e> <s> those are matters which we should leave i venture to suggest to the noble and learned lord and his advisers <e> <s> we know that he has his constraints on manpower and finance <e> <s> i am assured that he has taken them into account <e> <s> for my part i am not prepared to reject this package that he has offered us <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add just a very few words on one aspect of the bill namely the judicial aspect which is dealt with in clause <e> <s> that clause relates as the noble baroness has well explained to the right of appeal from australian courts to her majesty in council in effect to the judicial committee of the privy council which has existed for years under federation and even longer in relation to some of the colonies which existed before that date <e> <s> i have been personally and intimately associated with that process for years a privilege which i greatly esteem <e> <s> indeed that perhaps justifies the few observations which i wish to make <e>", "<cs> my lords we are getting a little behind time and the hour is getting late <e> <s> i cannot deny myself the pleasure first of offering very sincere congratulations to my noble and learned friends and colleagues lord roskill for his report and lord griffiths for his splendid maiden speech <e> <s> i congratulate them most heartily <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late hour in the evening and after the fine and authoritative speeches we have heard in the previous stages of this debate my own contribution must necessarily be a modest one <e> <s> i have it is true some connection with one of those older universities whose names escaped the memory of the noble lord lord mackie of benshie for the time being but for the purposes of this debate i would rather put forward a point of view perhaps the point <e>", "<cs> my lords since my noble and learned friend lord denning whose name is down on the list of speakers has had to leave the chamber perhaps from these benches i might be permitted to add a very few words in welcoming this bill <e> <s> i am sure that all your lordships lawyers or not would wish to thank the noble and learned lord on the woolsack for having introduced the bill with such gusto and even apparent enjoyment <e> <s> that perhaps prompts the thought it is a glimmer of hope that he might be tempted to emulate his great predecessor the earl of birkenhead and attempt a redrafting of the law of property in just such simple and popular language as the noble and learned lord used in expounding the tortuosities of this bill <e> <s> we are very grateful for having these difficult matters explained to us so clearly <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask your lordships indulgence in order to add one or two words prompted by the interesting and valuable observations made by noble and un-learned lords who have spoken in this debate <e> <s> i am referring if they will allow me the designation to the noble lords lord mais and lord kimball <e> <s> i agree that this is a useful bill and that the report on which it is based is a very valuable report <e> <s> but i should like to make the point which i think is inherent in the observations of some of your lordships too that the report is based on very narrow and limited terms of reference <e>", "<cs> i spoke on this subject at second reading <e> <s> i re-read recently what i then said and rather to my surprise i found that i still agreed with it <e> <s> it is necessary to be precise about this amendment and about subsection which is in the bill in page at line <e> <s> one is liable to be misled if one is not careful by the reference at line to <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall say only one or two words as it is getting late and i shall keep my comments brief <e> <s> as we all know this amendment arises from a decision that was given by this house in its appellate capacity <e> <s> i certainly do not wish to enter into a discussion as to whether that decision made legal sense or not <e> <s> it is a decision that has been given <e> <s> another decision could have been given which went the other way <e> <s> there it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i may be very stupid or i may have the wrong printed version or both those matters may be true but can the noble and learned lord confirm that in the third line of the first amendment the word him is correct <e> <s> i find it very puzzling if that is so <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness whether it is the intention of her majestys government to urge on the united states the necessity of complying with the decision of the international court of justice that was given in the case of the united states against nicaragua in which most of the activities of the united states in supporting interests in nicaragua were condemned in strong terms by the great majority of the judges <e>", "<cs> my lords i trust that the noble baroness will indulge me for just a few minutes <e> <s> i know that she wants to reply and i know that the house wants to hear her <e> <s> i want to say just a few words for two reasons <e> <s> one is that because of the unsocial hours at which the early stages of the bill came on i was not able to participate <e> <s> the other is that i should not like noble lords to think that the only legal doctrine about this bill or about the european communities is that which is so eloquently and movingly given us by my noble and learned friend lord denning and still less that given us by the noble viscount who spoke a few moments ago <e>", "<cs> then seemed to object to the bill which was designed to counteract that by enabling us to get access to the insurance market to get access to the professional market to increase our invisibles and to get more research and technology done <e> <s> it seems to me a strange argument <e> <s> however one has heard many strange arguments <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be permitted to offer one observation on this bill and to pose two questions with an apology for not having my name on the list of speakers <e> <s> i have to confess that my knowledge of this interesting and valuable bill came to me rather late in the day <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister confirm that the united nations policy of sanctions against south africa does not extend to namibia <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that i must add a few words in support of what has been said even though what i wanted to say has been said much better from the benches behind me <e> <s> i yield to no one in my admiration for the work which has been done in this area by sir brandon rhys williams who as well as being my relative is also my member of parliament <e> <s> i have also had many years of admiration for the work of mr nugee who is in the chambers that i was in at lincolns inn <e> <s> i have followed the work of his committee with great care and enthusiasm <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord will not look at this too hard because i found his answer entirely convincing <e> <s> just because these words were in the previous act is no reason for keeping them here if they are surplusage <e> <s> i should have suggested that if they are clearly surplus in clause it is a nonsense that the owner of the copyright has the exclusive right to authorise the acts <e> <s> who else has the right to authorise them <e> <s> what is the point of saying that somebody else can authorise them <e> <s> who else can authorise the doing of those acts except the owner of the copyright <e> <s> i found the ministers explanation entirely convincing <e> <s> the matter is dealt with in clause in a totally satisfactory way <e> <s> if anything is to be added what one needs to say is that if someone is authorised positively by the owner of a copyright <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that in a number of remand prisons i am not speaking of police cells but i speak from personal knowledge young persons who have never been convicted of any offence and are by definition innocent in this context are held together with other remand prisoners with many convictions behind them <e> <s> this causes very great moral distress and moral damage to such persons <e> <s> as a matter of urgency can the noble earl take steps to prevent that state of affairs occurring <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i may be permitted to add my voice to those who have paid tribute to the sponsor of the bill in another place <e> <s> like the noble earl lord halsbury i can claim that sir brandon was related to me by marriage <e> <s> i live in kensington which he represented with such distinction for a long time <e> <s> apart from those connections with him i long admired him in politics as an independent and socially-minded advocate of useful reforms <e> <s> if there is one thing for which he was renowned it was for the care with which he consulted interests which might have been involved in any legislation <e> <s> one has seen that in many other measures he brought forward <e>", "<cs> i do not intend to make another speech <e> <s> i should like to make just two short points <e> <s> needless to say one relates to scotland <e> <s> it is right to say that there are historical differences in many respects between scotland and england but the point here is that we are dealing with the same tax <e> <s> we are dealing with a poll tax a community tax <e> <s> it must be intolerable to have different sanctions in one part of the kingdom in england and wales imprisonment in one part and not in the other <e> <s> i fail to see how that difference can be defended <e>", "<cs> my lords my colleague here is disinterested <e> <s> i may claim <e>", "<cs> my lords i need say nothing more in closing except to remedy an omission <e> <s> i notice that the report does not contain the names of the committee for privileges set up by your lordships <e> <s> your lordships should know that it consisted of the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones with his great experience as a law officer the noble lord lord strabolgi to whom reference has been made who was associated with these matters personally the noble lord lord campbell of alloway and my noble and learned friend lord jauncey of tullichettle <e> <s> i am grateful to them for all the support they gave and the kind words that have been said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that after speakers your lordships wish to hear another lawyers speech so i shall be brief <e> <s> most of what i wanted to say has already been said and said better than i could have done by my noble and learned friends lord simon of glaisdale and lord hailsham of saint marylebone and by the noble lord lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> the non-legal aspects have been put by the noble lords lord mayhew and lord home and the right reverend prelate the bishop of st albans <e>", "<cs> my lords our convener has asked that i should associate the cross-bench peers with the tributes that have been paid <e> <s> that i most gladly do <e> <s> lord elwyn-jones was held in the greatest esteem and affection by all noble lords on these benches on account of his accessibility his invariable courtesy and the moderation and elegance with which he expressed his views <e> <s> to my noble and learned colleages in particular he was valued on account of his warm-hearted humanity and his strongly felt sense of justice <e>", "<cs> my lords i also ask indulgence from the noble and learned lord for entering the debate at this stage <e> <s> my excuse must lie in the helter-skelter nature of legislation nowadays presented to us <e> <s> it comes so thick and fast that it is almost impossible to be on top of it <e> <s> that will also justify the somewhat unprepared and disjointed character of some of the remarks i wish to make <e>", "<cs> my lords at the request of our convenor i should like to associate all noble lords who sit on these benches including my noble and learned colleagues with the moving tributes that have been paid to lord gardiner as lord chancellor and the expressions of sadness at his passing <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may raise another point before the noble and learned lord replies <e> <s> in principle the amendment seems very reasonable but i should like to ask the mover of it why it should not apply equally to defendants <e> <s> why does this apply only to plaintiffs <e>", "<cs> with respect whatever difficulties remain have been taken care of by amendment no <e> <s> which gives the noble and learned lord power to alter the figure <e> <s> one has to start with something and give him power to alter it upwards or downwards <e> <s> it is not left in an unsatisfactory position by a combination of those two subsections <e>", "<cs> i find clause as it stands totally unacceptable <e> <s> here we are dealing with civil proceedings in civil courts <e> <s> those courts are open to everybody who wishes to bring a case or who wishes to defend a case <e> <s> of course it you want to present yourself in a court you must abide by the rules <e> <s> if you do not you must expect certain consequences <e> <s> if you do not turn up when the case is supposed to be heard there is a risk of the case being dismissed or judgment being given against you <e> <s> there is a risk of costs being ordered against you and if you are a professional representative there is a risk of your being reported to your professional body the law society or the bar council <e> <s> all that goes without saying and does not require legislation <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble and learned lord will forgive me for interrupting him <e> <s> i know that that statement was made on the previous occasion <e> <s> in front of me i have the command paper which brings the convention before us <e> <s> on the face of it it states that the convention has been ratified by her majestys government <e> <s> that is a command paper dated <e> <s> i do not know whether there is some confusion but that command paper says that the convention has been ratified <e>", "<cs> i did not want to interrupt the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i wanted but to be succinct <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly reply to the noble and learned lord with thanks for the way in which he dealt with the matter <e> <s> i shall not comment on most of the points except to say this <e> <s> i have read a great many papers and files although not so many as the noble and learned lord has in his department <e> <s> although there has certainly been consultation it has not focused on the question of whether the convention has what i call the universal effect or the limited effect it has focused on the question of reference to the european court <e> <s> finally the protocol was evolved in the way that it was with objections not entirely met and the british point of view not entirely satisfied that being the main purpose of the consultation <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment for the reasons that have been given <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mishcon has pointed out clause is in extremely strong terms and appears to preclude reference to decisions of this place <e> <s> one can refer only to relevant decisions of the european court <e> <s> that is a strong argument in favour of my main submission on the effect of the convention <e> <s> i support the principle of the amendment basically for the reason which it is probably improper to voice but which i voice nevertheless that in any case most courts would refer to any relevant material and so it is much better to legitimise it in the form of a clause in the bill <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> he may care to note also that in the precedent was observed of putting in the preamble <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have a small point on schedule which i think is non-controversial <e> <s> on page at line i believe the greek to be incorrect <e> <s> i do not wish to give what i think is the correct greek because it would embarrass the writers of <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want my noble and learned friends cup to overflow completely but i wish to indicate my support for his amendment <e> <s> in committee i said that the subsection as drafted would not cover the case in which a defendant is supported <e> <s> it provides for the bringing of the proceedings <e> <s> our case is that where a defendant is supported by an outside person it may be desirable to order him to pay costs <e> <s> that is achieved indirectly by my noble and learned friends amendment and i am happy to add my support <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble and learned friend said this matter was discussed in committee <e> <s> i opposed the inclusion of this clause with some support from the benches opposite on the grounds that it is really for the court to organise its business and to ascertain whether people will attend <e> <s> it is really quite inappropriate to erect a heavy-handed structure of administration of fines hearings enforcements and so on in a civil case <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house will be grateful to the noble and learned lord for the explanation that he has given of the advice that he has received <e> <s> i do not propose to weary the house by answering it <e> <s> however there is an answer and there is a different view <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> i beg to move it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say just two words if i may <e> <s> i am very grateful to the noble and learned lord for proposing amendment no <e> <s> in response to a comment which i made at committee stage <e> <s> i have no doubt that it is an improvement to the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to offer a very brief observation on this bill <e> <s> before i do that i should like to correct something which i said at an earlier stage and to offer an apology to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> in a speech replying to one of the amendments and of course that speech was impromptu i claimed to have suffered some embarrassment by a reference by the noble and learned lord to a consultation which he said took place in which i thought had been sprung on me <e> <s> that was a plain mistake <e>", "<cs> i wish to say just one or two words of a strictly prosaic character <e> <s> there is first a procedural difficulty <e> <s> many members of the committee feel that it would have been easier if we had been discussing that matter in the context of the war crimes bill but unfortunately we cannot do that it is not our fault because that bill has been passed by the other place and sent to us in the form in which it is <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> i shall not speak generally on the whole subject of radio caroline <e> <s> the amendment can be justified on two grounds the first of which has been stated by the noble lord lord monson with the words <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to amendment no <e> <s> the noble and learned lord is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that the noble lord lord hylton in opening this debate was good enough to refer to the anti-slavery society of which i have the honour of being the joint-president perhaps i may be allowed to add a few words <e> <s> the society is very much concerned with this problem internationally <e> <s> it is worth bearing in mind that it is an international problem and it is not peculiar to this country <e> <s> the same kind of situation is known to exist in a number of european countries <e> <s> the anti-slavery society has been looking into it and it has put in a quite detailed report to the working group on contemporary forms of slavery <e>"]
