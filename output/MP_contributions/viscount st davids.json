parts of it which were thought to be inadvisable and now there is no need for me to move the instruction <e> <s> therefore all that remains is for me to thank those noble lords who would have supported me and to say is this not a happy state of affairs saving much time and money and does it not show that this house has a useful purpose by simply moving an instruction to protect us from some of the worst forms of the taking of unnecessary powers by local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords in the circumstances in which this question and the next one which is on the order paper in my

swept up <e>", "<cs> my lords did the noble lord see in the recent edition of the money programme on bbc television the sale of factory machinery when the extremely interesting point which was not made much of in that programme was made that although major firms were selling off the firms which were doing best and to whom machinery was selling most briskly were the small firms <e> <s> will he

i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble baroness that if we did start on this road we ought to start very gently and in a narrow field as the americans are with their very limited act <e> <s> nevertheless they now have some years of experience <e> <s> should we now not be asking them how well they have done in the course of these years of experience particularly at this moment when we have so many very eminent american lawyers present with us <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness give the house any indication of who should be expelled or what should be done in the matter of a cargo of american strategic oil bought commercially abroad and shipped on a normal merchant vessel which is subject to a salvage claim at this moment and where the american government is apparently claiming diplomatic immunity <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that there are some reasons why he should understand my misgivings when here i am a member of the public a member of no political party but sitting next door to one of the major givers of our laws and hearing that the government for all their endeavours still do not know what the law is <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not of some interest to the noble lord that the number of jobs advertised by the institute of personnel management for new personnel managers seems to be increasing rather quickly <e> <s> would he not conceive it as a possibility that usually they hire the personnel managers then later hire the personnel <e> <s> would this be of some interest to him <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that before coming to the house some of us not having seen who would be answering were prepared to be rather nasty about this <e>

sink into insignificance and finally to vanish <e> <s> if it is a matter of economy is it not possible to move part of the staff from one school to another without extra expense to a local authority

as it should be <e> <s> should not the whole matter of competition be taken much further <e>", "<cs> my lords will her majestys government consider repealing the dock labour act and thus prevent londons port becoming only a museum <e> <s> although this may not be quite the same question and therefore not answerable at this moment will they consider it <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not clear that any peer who offered mr bristow an honour of any kind must inevitably have been suffering from certifiable insanity and is thus exclusible from this house <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord of the opinion which my wife and i found ourselves very strongly to hold after some six weeks on a remote philippine island just before this election that the filipinos are possibly the best natural democrats seen anywhere in the world <e> <s> was this not made extremely clear by the extraordinary manner in which they conducted their recent troubles with remarkably little rioting and quite remarkably few deaths <e> <s> in view of this should we not be giving them all possible help in putting matters right especially in view of the fact that marcos and his family have managed to extract from the economy for themselves or their purposes an amount so far as can now be made out of some billion dollars <e> <s> would the noble lord therefore not agree that there is need for a great deal of help if the filipinos are to get straight <e> <s> would the noble lord find it difficult to agree with me that there are some definite advantages for a country in putting a lady in charge of it <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord not concede that in the times when government and trade unions were busy over-stuffing the economy with unnecessary workers it would have been a miracle indeed if unemployment had gone up <e> <s> the great miracle today when the government are busy making industry leaner and more efficient is that unemployment has not gone up much more than it has <e> <s> that is the real miracle we are now looking at <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord consider whether we should not be reversing a bad habit of ours of splendidly inventing things and then failing to develop them <e> <s> should we not be helping those particular lines where we now have a powerful lead <e> <s> one is the building of small airships and another the development of hot sulphur batteries <e> <s> in those lines we have a lead in the world <e> <s> surely those are the directions in which we should be pushing <e> <s> can the noble lord make any comment <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree with the words used by the questioner who said that it was an unfortunate drop in prices <e> <s> is it not more true to say and perhaps the noble lord could advise us that the drop in prices was of enormous advantage to this country and indeed to the whole world <e>", "<cs> my lords is this not a case which should notably be left to local option <e> <s> is it not true that if iran was part of the ec it would be scandalised by many matters which we permit whereas if we became subject to its laws we should also be scandalised <e> <s> is this not a matter in which we should each be allowed our own opinions <e> <s> cannot the ec be arranged so that matters on which local opinions are extremely strong are left to us and not to others <e>", "<cs> my lords one knows that there are many cases and matters in this country to which crown immunity applies <e> <s> one knows that there is a power in the crown to waive that immunity wherever it considers it should be waived <e> <s> can the noble baroness tell me whether this power applies in these hospital cases and would it be waived if the matter was considered to be serious enough <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord campbell of croy for enabling me to say a few words on the subject of the tourist trade <e> <s> i want to limit myself to the inland waterways what they are doing to tourism and what they could do if they were further developed <e>", "<cs> my lords if every stupid suggestion of a possible honour or anything else had to be referred to a member of the judiciary can the noble and learned lord suggest just how many judges we would have to have in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am independent and i do not have a party standing behind me <e> <s> that has its disadvantages at times but it also has the advantage that sometimes one manages to have friends on both sides of the house <e> <s> it is the smallest of political change

right hand and thus the political left i had support from the noble lord lord pitt who since he and his family happened to live in the island of grenada did know something about the subject <e>",

though of great interest are peripheral and that if we go on trying to collect the different figures which may be relevant it will be enormously expensive and not to our advantage <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend if he will allow me to call him so consider hanging upon his wall a fine chaucerian quotation which is unfortunately little known <e> <s> it is this <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness comment on the fact that there is a dilemma here <e> <s> in the case of this and many other preventable diseases once we have vaccinated down to a certain <e>", "<cs> my lords is this not a grim and one would hope rather stimulating comment to <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend consider having somewhere at the back of his mind i do not mean instantly this point <e> <s> tourism can be helped by encouraging the rebuilding of certain of our inland waterways a subject that i am sure he knows about well <e> <s> of course one does not get all that much from the actual rebuilding or indeed the starting of the resultant waterways but each waterway rebuilt creates a sheaf of new employment along each side of it <e> <s> this in the end produces a great many new and permanent jobs which are of great value to this country both for earning foreign currency and also in dissuading our own people from going abroad <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to my noble friends sense of puzzlement is he not surprised that the noble lord who asked the question is unable to link courage and fear <e> <s> is he not aware as i am sure he is that any time i have had to do anything particularly courageous i have felt very considerable fear up to the point of being physically affected <e> <s> if one is courageous is not the ultimate result that ones friends back one considerably

remove restricting laws which inhibit the proper working of agriculture <e> <s> is not sauce for the goose sauce for the gander <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl not agree that it would be quite horrific if in any service that was privatised there were no failures at all <e> <s> would that not prove that those services were being paid for at a grossly inappropriate and high rate <e> <s> is it not the case that what should happen is that a service should be paid for at a reasonable rate because then the weakest would go to the wall and therefore later on better services would be produced somewhat cheaper <e>", "<cs> my lords have we not yet learned the lesson of the gadarene swine that if we are so bedevilled and insane as to try to keep level with each other we shall all end up by running over the cliff <e>", "<cs> my lords does the house consider that the lead development association should be commended for its action and what is more for its general conservationist attitude in that it hopes that that and other lead will go into lead accumulators and batteries which will power electric boats which will thus cause even less pollution of our inland waterways <e>", "<cs> my lords ought not this day to be celebrated for at least some happy aspects <e> <s> among them there is a personal one which interests me to whit the day that william of orange landed was the day when the death by hanging of my five-times-great-grandfather was suddenly cancelled <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down can he say whether the forestry commission regulations have any statutory weight and whether if anyone breaks them that is a criminal offence <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord not agree that he has possibly not made as much as he might of the very good work being done from winson green prison <e> <s> prisoners from there have been released all over the area to do all sorts of valuable work including to my knowledge work on the inland waterways <e> <s> this work and all the other work that is being done is enormously valuable not only to the area but also to the prisoners themselves <e> <s> will the noble lord agree that the real trouble with this government is that they are not blowing their own trumpet enough <e> <s> they have a great many things they could talk about but they simply do not <e> <s> it is this that one rather despairs of <e>

training to be a policeman takes a fairly long time <e> <s> could not an applicant at least start on this training and have a few weeks of it which would do no harm to the public or to the applicant while his application was still being considered <e> <s> if he is rejected no harm will have been done and if he is accepted the period will have been considerably shortened <e>", "<cs> in view of the noble earls excellent explanation and the fact that the police do not seem to need these powers although no doubt later it might be possible to do something about it if they did and bearing in mind as he said that under section they already have powers which would cover this point i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that although a higher figure for aids has not yet turned up in our prisons it should be <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that very good answer but is he aware that this practice is causing distress to some old people who are being asked for money <e> <s> if it was simply a case of a penny for the guy they could say no but in this case it is difficult for old people because they may have a trick played on them <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend recall that on wednesday in answer to a question of mine he said that the bill would contain clauses relating to putting in fear <e> <s> is it intended to use those clauses in a case such as this <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who has been in this house for some years may i ask the noble viscount the leader whether he is aware that great improvements in legislation in recent years have been caused by the addition to our house first of life peers who are eminent in their various walks of life and secondly of the ladies <e> <s> in my experience this has made an enormous improvement to the house <e> <s> will the noble viscount consider carrying this policy considerably further if it is possible to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow the noble viscount in his argument with much of which i agree but i feel it is my duty to speak for a very short time and i am going to deal with one simple point which i will express as briefly as i possibly can <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister have figures for the damage done to the environment by the accidental spillage of dangerous and poisonous cargoes from road vehicles compared with comparable dangers from spillage from road or water transport <e> <s> are there figures that he can give the house on this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether things are any worse in schools in the london area <e> <s> can we really blame the children when we see what some london schools are trying to stuff into their unfortunate minds <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in the navy there are regulations about the length of knife that can be carried <e> <s> indeed if one had a longer knife one deliberately had the end broken off <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord will not be aware that i carried a knife for rigging purposes <e> <s> i deliberately broke the end off making it cease to be a weapon of offence and usable only as a useful knife <e> <s> i should like to ask whether or not some regulations can be produced to ensure that knives cannot be sold if they are useful as weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that the main cause of this country having heavier unemployment than others was that strange but not uncommon avian occurrence featherbedding coming home to roost <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the mistake made by my llth great grandfather years ago in changing the system from heirs general to heirs male and in view of the very different ideas of today is his act not an excellent precedent for putting the matter right now and allowing the ladies to have what they should have <e>", "<cs> my lords is not what is really important the number of officers who can be appointed to this very important job <e> <s> i refer not merely to increased office staff but if i may use a very old-fashioned phrase to the number of riding officers who are actually on the ground going round and investigating the matter <e> <s> can the noble lord give us any figures <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord confirm a feeling that a number of noble lords have that much as these pamphlets are needed and they are badly needed that in so far as concerns the asian population owing to the strength of their religion and other customs there is likely to be a rather less number of aids cases among them than among other people <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord confirm that the figure that is given as a deficit includes enormous sums in multi-millions that we are investing abroad <e> <s> that has made us the third richest creditor in the world after germany and japan <e> <s> it will also provide an income for us for generations to come after the oil bonanza has ceased <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord be very careful not to follow the suggestion of various noble lords that the government should interfere and instruct various large organisations <e> <s> did we not get rid of nationalisation exactly to prevent that <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be better if all the details necessary for the course of justice were handed to the judge who could then give them to those entitled to have them <e> <s> this would secure the safety of everyone concerned and prevent the troubles that could be involved in the present provision <e>", "<cs> my lords has it been taken on board that the most important thing on this sort of occasion and which ought to be made compulsory is that there should be a complete and accurate list of the names of all those on board and that this is most important not only for the relatives of those who die but also to make sure that the ship is not overloaded which on this occasion seems to have been a bit marginal <e>", "<cs> my lords may i declare an interest in that i was born in richmond terrace <e> <s> can the noble lord tell me whether when the work is completed it will be possible for those of us who are interested in the result to be invited to come to have a look at it <e> <s> i should like to see the old home again <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who for a number of years has studied the design and stability of hulls is the noble lord aware that the redesign of these ferries will be necessary because they are not capable of totally safe operation at all times <e> <s> is he further aware of the need to redesign and considerably alter the harbours that the ferries use <e> <s> that will cost an enormous sum of money <e> <s> will the matter be taken carefully into consideration so that some provision can be made for it for we shall have to do it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i <e>", "<cs> it is only a short point <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government congratulate the citizens of merton on having million to invest when unfortunate people like us in camden find that we are short of a great deal more than that and we have to borrow <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask a question as one who on occasion navigates the river lea <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that a great deal has been done of late to improve the banks although a great deal still needs to be done both to the banks and to the water <e> <s> is the noble lord further aware that what this waterway really needs is to be used for the purposes it was built for for commercial cargo <e> <s> that is what should be established on this waterway <e> <s> it is ideally situated for this purpose but this use is inhibited by the dock labour acts <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to concentrate this evening on the rather narrow point of the safety of low bulkhead decked ships <e> <s> we are all very grateful for the new regulations which are going to make the handling of seagoing ferries much safer <e> <s> the difficulty is that the ships themselves are basically unsafe because they are low bulkhead decked ships <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether when he says that such ships are watertight up to the main deck level he means the bulkhead deck <e> <s> i agree with him on that <e> <s> however they are not watertight above <e>", "<cs> quite <e>", "<cs> my lords has my noble friend seen recent statistics showing that those who because of their upbringing have already had to learn two or more languages are very apt to learn still more languages <e> <s> is he aware that languages come easily to them <e> <s> it is upon such young people especially those who are not good with their hands but who are often good at languages that we should be concentrating <e>", "<cs> can the noble viscount satisfy my considerable curiosity and explain a traffic calming method <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord noticed that before there is any other form of rise in employment there is a marked rise in the employment of personnel officers <e> <s> the noble baroness lady seear will be well aware of that <e> <s> naturally employment officers have to be employed before anyone else can be taken on <e> <s> has the minister noticed that that particular rise is going rather fast at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who attempts to be a citizen of the world as i did when i was a member of the labour party but it seems to have turned from that opinion of late may i ask whether my noble friend agrees that it is a splendid thing that we provide trained nurses for other nations which are not so well equipped <e> <s> that is a situation in which we should rejoice rather than be sorrowful that the nurses are going elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell whether there is any hope of assisting many people who have spare accommodation in their houses to let that accommodation without paying tax on the income from it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord confirm that there is no inheritance tax payable between husband and wife and that therefore there is no question of widows and widowers being thrown out of the home for any such reason <e> <s> it is the next generation those who have some interest in the family home but who nevertheless may have homes of their own by then about which we are talking <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord can suggest how we might overcome the dilemma <e> <s> a number of people break our laws who if they were citizens of this country would appear before our courts <e> <s> however those people leave our country almost immediately but what can we do about it <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask one question on an issue that is raised in the main question <e> <s> can the noble lord expand his answer on the subject of cabotage <e> <s> the present position seems to be a long way from that which is necessary if europe is to be united <e> <s> do we not need to progress much further <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that a vast majority of the boroughs in this country have never been under the control of ilea or anything like that but that they have always conducted their education and youth services extremely well <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that what is being said by the noble lord lord young has been stated many times in this house and therefore does not need repeating here as a first event <e> <s> i quite agree that many noble lords have not heard this material <e> <s> however does he agree that this is material that needs driving into peoples heads with a hammer <e> <s> it appears that some people need a hammer for that <e>", "<cs> my lords for a number of years i have taught history in a school especially designed for the children of parents coming to work in this country who wish their children to study in british schools <e> <s> is it not true that this matter can best be handled by private enterprise <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the minister will consider and deal with a difference in method which appears to have arisen between other european countries and ourselves in that when it comes to new products they appear to be willing to help finance the introduction of these whereas in this country small firms are only given help if what they intend to do is research which has no direct commercial product in view <e> <s> that is something which small firms are highly unlikely to do and therefore the help which is being given is only going to larger firms when it should be going to smaller firms <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord really saying that the threat is not an offence and only the actual commission of the act is <e> <s> is he really saying that to point a pistol at a mans head is not an offence and it only becomes one when the man is actually shot dead <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend know whether there are any dry docks in this country which are able to take a vessel of that size <e> <s> is he aware that if there are no such dry docks any repairs done to this vessel would have to be done abroad <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will no doubt be aware of the paper that i have just been able to put on his desk concerning the scandalous state of affairs in camden where flats have been let to prostitutes and drug users <e> <s> in at least one block apparently the great majority of flats have been so let <e> <s> some flats have also been let to itinerant irish people who have sub-let them at high prices for their own purposes <e> <s> i am unable to limit this

of homeless people in london <e> <s> moreover since the centre of this activity appears to be a place called grease street does it not appear to the minister that a certain amount of greasing has been going on <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of many people and in the form of a question may i express intense appreciation of the vast distance that the profession has advanced in recent years which makes it almost a pleasure to go to the dentist rather than to the old horror torture dungeon one used to expect in years long ago <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept the pleasure that many of us feel at seeing him in good health <e>", "<cs> my lords in support of my noble friend lord campbell perhaps i may ask whether the noble baroness is aware that a few years ago the state of the thames was so had that if a vessel was painted and it remained in the lower thames for hours the paint turned black <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord taken into consideration that anybody who leaves his country in these extremely difficult and dangerous circumstances is likely to be far above the average in mentality and value in comparison with the rest of the people in that country

among the most valuable of his subjects in order to enrich his greatest enemy <e>", "<cs> my lords since the great majority of fires in such buildings are caused by overloaded electric circuits can

reason for speaking in this debate <e> <s> it is what one might call a constituency reason in that i am lord hungerford <e> <s> i was on a holiday on my boat when the terrible tragedy occurred and at first i could not believe it <e> <s> why should such a terrible thing happen in hungerford <e> <s> we know of the many terrible incidents which happen in inner cities <e> <s> we are told usually by the opposition that they are due to high unemployment bad housing terrible surroundings and the lack of honest things to do to pass ones time <e> <s> none of that is true in hungerford which is a sweet little town <e> <s> it is surrounded by beautiful public parklands <e> <s> it has a charming high street which leads down the hill to the river kennet with excellent fishing <e> <s> the kennet and avon canal has been refurbished and now has good boating <e> <s> all the sports and so forth that one might expect to find in the countryside are available in and around hungerford <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl tell the house whether there are any signs or statistics relating to the possibility that because of difficulties of carrying on the criminals who have so far been burglars are being driven on to the streets as muggers <e>", "<cs> my lords following the supplementary question of the noble lord lord ennals is it not true that butane is the gas in the little blue gas bottles which are sold in every camping shop for everyone including young people to use as cooking gas when camping <e> <s> is not that a particularly difficult problem <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord noticed that where these devices are used there has been a marked decrease both in the number of people killed by electrocution and in house fires produced by faulty electric circuits <e> <s> should not a great deal more be done to push local authorities and to give them powers where they fail to have them and also to make sure that all workshops multiple-use houses and private houses have circuit-breakers fitted <e> <s> even now too many people are being killed by using electric lawnmowers without such protection <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord give me and a number of other noble lords a short lesson in economics <e> <s> is not a country very similar to a factory <e> <s> when it increases production does it not first of all take in a lot of machinery and raw materials which at that point it cannot instantly pay for <e> <s> does it not also pay a lot of people to do work which is not instantly at that moment productive and thus is slightly inflationary <e> <s> is that not the phase that we are now going through <e>", "<cs> my lords when tenants are compulsorily removed after this fashion can the minister tell me whether they carry with them the length of period during which they lived in their former home as a right towards the purchase of a freehold should they wish to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that although the tropical rain forests are enormously important for a whole number of reasons which have been suggested today the best place to produce tropical hardwoods is in the tropics and that in a free world that is what should be done <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord take into consideration the terrible effect that the dock labour scheme is having upon the inland waterways in that all the dock labour ports are in fact the entrances to those waterways <e> <s> the damage is that the scheme is reducing the entire cargo-carrying capacity and business of those waterways <e>", "<cs> my lords has my noble friend noticed that there is a total tax concession on electric cars which put their lead into batteries rather than into the air <e> <s> at the present moment there is very little concession to electric boats which represent the easiest way to develop electric cars <e> <s> i declare an interest in that i am investing in a company which builds motors for electric boats but that is merely a matter of putting my money where my voice is <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself in very large agreement with the noble lord lord addington on the subject of pollution especially of our inland waterways <e> <s> in fact it is already on record that i am putting a large sum from my own very small personal financial resources into doing something about that <e> <s> so i must say that i congratulate the noble lord <e> <s> i am very happy to hear him speaking today <e> <s> on another occasion i should be very happy to get together with him and do something about this problem <e> <s> however on this particular evening i have another subject to broach <e>", "<cs> my lords as the owner of a small vessel who has some objection to paying additional taxation may nevertheless ask whether such a system would not have its advantages <e> <s> for many years i kept a craft on the yugoslavian coast where all pleasure craft were licensed <e> <s> that system caused no trouble whatever it paid for the many lights needed on that coast and it also had many additional advantages of which the noble lord might be interested to hear <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not perfectly clear that it is easy to reduce the unemployment figure to zero if it is done by the labour party method <e> <s> that method is to give people useless or feather-bedding jobs <e> <s> was not the first rise in unemployment caused by that strange alien phenomenon of featherbedding coming home to roost <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness not agree that the happiest state in relation to the price of eggs is when as is now occurring where i live two large supermarkets fight each other over prices <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the real trouble is that bodies become lumbered with old written commitments in which at one time they firmly believed but which they later find are an encumbrance and would like to dispose of <e> <s> is that not mr arafats trouble as indeed is the similar commitment of the labour party to socialism <e>", "<cs> my lords may i <e>", "<cs> my lords very briefly <e>", "<cs> my lords i think everyone would agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not find it enough merely to agree with the major number of things which have been said by other noble lords this afternoon although i agree with many of them <e> <s> i found a chord in my heart particularly struck by something which was said by the noble earl lord caithness at the beginning of the debate <e> <s> he said <e>", "<cs> my lords in further support of the question put by the noble viscount would not a great deal of help be given if it were possible to expand the funds which are available for research more in the direction of products which are possibly immediately saleable even if that meant a slight reduction in funds for rather more indirect research <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord say anything about the large sums which are being spent on the purchase of private homes <e> <s> has he noted that the money thus invested tends in the end to be the seedcorn which provides the capital for the thousands of small businesses which are this countrys ultimate future <e>", "<cs> my lords the law has regrettably given certain people a monopoly to do certain things <e> <s> will my noble friend comment as to whether there should be a right not to do certain things <e> <s> surely where a monopoly gives someone the right and the duty is not carried out someone has the right to step in <e> <s> a monopoly should not be negative <e>", "<cs> my lords might one way out of the difficulty be to opt for local preference as we did in respect of drinking on sundays <e> <s> already we have scotland on a different course to england <e> <s> already we have a number of units of local government enforcing the law according to their ideas <e> <s> would it not be better to let them continue to do so and go straight to a local preference <e>", "<cs> my lords has my noble friend noticed that as a result of this change a rush has already started of pensioners who are able and intelligent and who want work taking part-time work behind the counters of major stores where there has been a marked shortage of workers because of the present levels of employment <e>", "<cs> my lords everybody knows that i have been an opponent of the clock labour acts for a very long time <e> <s> i was not always so <e> <s> i strongly agree with the noble baroness that these acts were necessary at the time they were produced <e> <s> the trouble is that times have changed <e> <s> what is particularly noticeable is the difference in costs between a scheme port and a non-scheme port <e> <s> i have many friends in the coastal and short transit trades <e> <s> i have asked them again and again what is the cost difference between taking a ship into one or the other type of port <e> <s> the figures that i have been given have varied <e> <s> they have ranged on the lowest side from in other words double the price and more to take it into a scheme port up to which is totally prohibitive <e> <s> given such figures it becomes impossible for the scheme ports to continue <e> <s> the only way they could go is down <e> <s> therefore i very much welcome the step that is being taken <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that the real danger to <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord have any objection if the hong kong citizens who wish to have british passports came to this country with passports as portuguese <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend confirm that during their period in office the labour party added billion to our debts which according to my calculations mean that we have to pay out billion a year simply to service those <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord draw to the attention of industry the fact that those who are crippled in one way or another may become much stronger in another way <e> <s> the man with one arm is likely to be much stronger in that arm than if he had two arms <e> <s> the supreme example is professor stephen hawking who having only his magnificent brain and the power to move one finger is our leading scientist and famed throughout the world <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness give us any information on the one part of the soviet offensive which seems to be continuing in full force namely its espionage <e>", "<cs> my lords do my noble friends figures include the very large sums spent in teaching every single school child military skills <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell the house what the government intend to do as regards the many portuguese passports which are now being sold in nearby macau <e> <s> is the minister aware that the chinese in hong kong and macau are very closely related by family and that these passports will enable them to come here but will not enable them to move on to canada and other places <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish that i could agree with the noble lord lord mccarthy on this issue but i find it almost impossible to do so <e> <s> i do not agree that the legislation will cause damage to the dockers <e> <s> i believe the contrary <e> <s> i also believe most strongly that the dock labour acts as they exist are doing a great deal of damage <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to put a suggestion whether it will be of any use others must judge <e> <s> what do we all wish to do <e> <s> we wish to hand over hong kong in the best possible state <e> <s> the people there want to continue with their lives in the splendid manner in which they always have <e> <s> the government of china have shown through many years one consistent desire only and that is that they do not want just a bit of territory littered with a number of dissident people <e> <s> they want to receive hong kong as a fat and healthy goose laying golden eggs <e> <s> they do not want to receive just a dead bird <e>", "<cs> my lords i can bring some consolation to the noble lord lord rochester <e> <s> there will be a great deal of retraining in the former scheme ports because they will clearly be entering a golden age <e> <s> on second reading i spoke on this subject <e> <s> i pointed out that the former scheme ports have enormous advantages over the non-scheme ports in that all their inland transport is much better organised and much shorter <e> <s> their rail services are better and shorter and so are their inland waterway services for that matter <e> <s> they not only have that advantage they have all sorts of ancient port works which at the moment are grossly under-used and which they will now be able to put to their proper purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister and the government take great care that in we do not have a single european post office inflicted upon us <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl further correct the noble baroness lady phillips <e> <s> a peer can no longer be tried by his fellow peers as i well know because in i was one of the two peers who abolished this procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord answer a question that puzzles me and causes trouble to a number of other people <e> <s> this money is coming from the borrowers but it is going to the lenders who are thus being given more money <e> <s> what is the effect of this on the financial position in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords does the figure for frigates and destroyers include those valuable vessels corvettes which we seem to be sending all over the world on most important duties and which are in fact smaller and cheaper than those other vessels <e>", "<cs> my lords i wanted to find out about the figure for corvettes and whether they are included <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether there are any teachers here who have done what i used to do in class which was to allow the young to get up put their hands up and say sir you are being boring <e>", "<cs> my lords has my noble friend noticed that there is a tendency within the tourist industry to clump together certain areas such as london and stratford <e> <s> does he know of any method to encourage a more even spread of visitors over the rest of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend detect anything in the fact that although in and the years afterwards there was a very large building programme in the soviet navy these ships are now becoming somewhat aged and needing repairs <e> <s> is that not distorting the fact that there may be a reduction in the strength of the soviet navy <e> <s> can he tell me whether on balance the figure is going up or down <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to congratulate the noble baroness and ask an original question <e> <s> is she aware of the enormous drain that is likely to be made on our educational system by the events which have occurred on the other side of what used to be called the iron curtain <e> <s> has she noticed that poland is asking for teachers of english that other countries are likely to add considerably to the total and therefore that we may experience a considerable drain <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the key point of the entire discussion that we should try to make it profitable for countries to keep their rain forests <e> <s> does my noble friend agree that unless we can manage to do so we shall continue to be on a loser and that sooner or later we shall have no rain forests whatever <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a problem which has many possible answers <e> <s> i do not believe that any one of them will solve the whole problem <e> <s> it is a matter of a number of different solutions each of which will produce some effect <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords when listing the various advantages that the peripheral areas will have will the minister say what effect the community charge will have on those areas <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister ensure that the aid is spread among small companies since that is not only the most economic way of dealing with the problem but also at this stage of the development of eastern europe any company of value is likely to be small <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord make sure that his department is aware of the lines from coleridge which state <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble viscount noted the old saying that the farmers boots make the best manure <e> <s> has he also noted that every chairman of a nationalised industry so far has shortly afterwards left the labour party <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord noticed the similarity to the occasion when russia invaded finland <e> <s> then the united states said that it sympathised and the finnish ambassador in washington in somewhat unambassadorial frame said how pleased he was that the united states with its vast resources of men money and materials had sent its sympathy <e>", "<cs> my lords is this whole question not a clear indication that the labour party consists of little englanders <e> <s> chernobyl and other incidents have shown that the destruction of nuclear waste is an international problem that should not be confined in the manner suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that to bring a large number of men and women to live in the beautiful area of st davids can only be good for their health <e>", "<cs> my lords if unfortunately it is impossible to change this rather surprising law and a great deal of the trouble lies in its schedule is it possible to amend the schedule <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not important that we should not give aid to any former communist countries until it is clear that communism and socialism have ceased to exist in those areas <e> <s> throwing good money after bad is no way to help them <e> <s> that money will be needed when they have recovered in order to give them the proper help that we wish them to have <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that japan is the business failure capital of the world at the moment closely followed by the united states and west germany and then us and that at the other end of the scale come north korea and albania <e> <s> is it clear in which direction we should be going <e>", "<cs> my lords following on from the previous question can the noble lord tell us how <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the way in which the citizens of europe are likely to travel increasingly from one country to another in future so that therefore this problem is likely to cross national boundaries is attention being given to unification of the scheme throughout europe <e> <s> that is surely its ultimate fate <e>", "<cs> my lords i meant to make this point later in the debate this afternoon but due to ill-health i shall not be able to attend <e> <s> is it not true that a limited amount of inflation and damage to the economy can be a good thing but that like all medicines it has limitations <e> <s> like many medicines it is good in limited doses but beyond a certain point it becomes damaging <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not now clear that the costs involved in abolishing the dock labour scheme have been far and away completely buried by the extra value which has been generated from the use of the large quantities of land which were entirely frozen and devastated by the scheme <e> <s> that has made any costs entirely irrelevant <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord give any detail of how we are encouraging the teaching of english where we are pushing at an open door <e> <s> is that not a marked way of increasing british exports <e>"]
