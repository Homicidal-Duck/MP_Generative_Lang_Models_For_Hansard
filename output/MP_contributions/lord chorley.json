["<cs> my lords i am fortunate to be able to make my maiden speech on a subject as important as the brandt report <e> <s> its subject matter has interested me for some years although my own experience has been rather moreshall i sayat the coal face than concerned with international conferences and commissions <e> <s> if one is to find a text for the report i should rather like to take brownings <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all grateful to the noble lord lord birdwood for giving us this opportunity to discuss the future of the newspaper industry and i shall want to pick up a number of the points that he made in his admirable and extremely wide-ranging speech <e> <s> the newspaper industry must be i suppose just about the most researched and investigated industry in the country <e> <s> there have been three royal commissions since the war the last reporting four years ago and numerous other reports books and articles of varying degrees of usefulness <e> <s> one might well think that there was little new that could be said about it but an old concern can take on a new emphasis in the changing environment in which our press has to operate <e> <s> the speeches we have already heard show that i think <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish i could follow the inimitable style of the noble lord lord davies <e> <s> like him i will try to be brief in fact i will try to beat him <e> <s> i wish to concentrate on agriculture in particular agriculture in sub-saharan africa <e> <s> my remarks are based in the main on my own observations from a professional involvement with economic development in africa but they are partly reinforced and reinforced with a great deal more authority than i can command by a world bank report which has already been referred to and which was published last summer <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the existing bodies can take some comfort from the reply of the noble lord the minister <e> <s> but is the noble lord aware that if his answer is what i take it to be it should be of some help in the united kingdom profession in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all sides of the house will welcome the report of the select committee on group accounts and the united kingdom legislature is indeed fortunate in being able to bring such really expert authority to its scrutiny of technical and complex proposals such as the proposed seventh directive <e> <s> i know too that the accountancy profession in this country will welcome the conclusions reached by the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble earl lord bessborough has said we were most lucky to have in our chairman the noble lord lord shackleton a former president of the royal geographical society <e>", "<cs> at this stage there is little one can usefully add to what has already been said in support of the amendment <e> <s> not for the first time i find myself in agreement with the noble lord lord benson <e> <s> i should like to emphasise one point but i first ought to declare an interest in that i am a practising accountant <e> <s> as has been said the basis of the bill is one of self-regulation <e> <s> yet it is difficult to see how an rpb can be effective and exercise its functions properly unless the legislation accords the rpb protection from damages <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my support to the amendment in the names of the noble lord lord benson and others <e> <s> i should perhaps first declare an interest as a practising accountant <e> <s> my institute attaches a good deal of importance to the amendment on the basis that half a loaf is better than no loaf at all <e> <s> i do not believe that the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne has made quite the right point <e> <s> the argument for half a loaf becomes all the more compelling if the regulatory authority is denied immunity against litigation by investors as the noble lord lord hacking says <e> <s> in these circumstances the rpb will have to act even more swiftly and decisively and with even less evidence perhaps than would otherwise be the case in order to ensure that it has escaped any possibility of litigation by an investor <e> <s> surely it is the corollary that the rpb will be even more vulnerable to litigation by those that it authorises to engage in investment business and that immunity against such litigation will become even more important <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord hacking for giving us this opportunity to discuss the problem of civil liability in the professions and for the comprehensive way in wich he introduced the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i intend to follow the lead of the noble lord lord sherfield and confine my remarks to the workings of select committees <e> <s> the report of the group notes <e>", "<cs> my lords i propose to base my remarks on the committees recommendations that <e>", "<cs> i support the amendments <e> <s> i speak as an accountant who has been in practice for some years <e> <s> i doubt whether any accountant in practice would disagree with the general sentiments of paragraph of schedule that is to say that his professional body must have adequate monitoring arrangements to see that its rules are complied with <e>", "<cs> i should also like to support the amendment <e> <s> had i been able to be present at the second reading debate i should have spoken on the subject of this amendment <e> <s> i believe that is by far and away the most important point which remains to be dealt with in part ii of the bill <e> <s> it is vital for the effective regulation of my profession that this amendment is passed because it supplies the missing keystone in the whole paraphernalia of regulation <e> <s> do not cavil at schedule and its related schedules and clauses but without this amendment the whole business of effective regulation will be put in jeopardy <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> i have an interest in as much as i have been involved in the work of the national trust for many years <e> <s> as we have heard from the noble lord lord gibson the national trust has a natural interest in the conservation problem of surplus lands <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak principally to amendment no <e> <s> which is one might say the centrepiece of this raft of amendments <e> <s> as one of those who strongly supported the amendment of the noble lord lord gibson or perhaps one might say the national trusts amendment on the sale of surplus land at the committee stage i think it right to acknowledge that the noble earl the minister has done what he said he would do <e> <s> he has listened to the argument and has come back with a new clause which coupled with other amendments especially that dealing with the definitions of functional and non-functional land deals in very large measure with the problems we raised in committee <e> <s> certainly both the national trust and i think i can say also the cpre welcome these amendments <e> <s> indeed one could go further for in many respects the amendments we are now discussing are wider more comprehensive and more flexible than our original proposals <e> <s> that is good <e>", "<cs> my lords today we are discussing a huge subject <e> <s> i should like to begin by adding my congratulations to the noble and gallant lord lord carver not only for the masterly way in which he introduced the subject tonight but also for the way he handled our committee <e> <s> i should add that much credit must go to our clerk and our technical advisers for their considerable help in this complex field <e> <s> if a member of the sub-committee may be permitted to say so i believe the end product of our report is fully up to the high standard set by previous select committee reports <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may follow the noble lord lord mcintosh at his invitation and begin by congratulating him on the exceptionally lucid and masterly way in which he took us through a very complex grouping of more than amendments <e> <s> as he said they are all concerned with aspects of the work of the joint committee <e>", "<cs> my understanding is that the countryside commission accepts that <e> <s> i tried to indicate that in my speech <e> <s> nevertheless for all sorts of reasons it would prefer to have a proper standing as regards functions on the joint committee <e>", "<cs> the joint committee would have the extra responsibilities <e> <s> the countryside commission for england still continues <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that we shall have a slightly confused discussion because the linkage in this grouping in some sense seems to be rather remote <e> <s> it will not surprise the noble earl to hear that i intend to speak mostly about amendment no <e> <s> to which i put my name together with the noble and <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his intervention <e> <s> i did not intend to state that every scot in the land was against such a committee <e> <s> however there were undoubtedly a considerable number who were <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene briefly to say that i support the amendment in spirit but not unnaturally i prefer the alternative approach of amendment no <e> <s> which we discussed earlier this afternoon when i spoke to it at length <e> <s> the noble baroness lady blatch did not favour the amendment but we have not yet reached it in terms of a division and i hope that she will be more favourably disposed to the present amendment <e>"]
