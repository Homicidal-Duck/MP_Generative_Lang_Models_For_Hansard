["<cs> my lords i must first express my thanks to the noble lord lord bellwin for his exposition of the bill although as the debate has gone on and we are now nearly halfway through perhaps commiserations would be more appropriate <e> <s> i cannot recall a single speaker who has spoken in his support <e>", "<cs> i believe i shall be expressing the views of noble lords on all sides of the committee when i say how delighted i was to hear the words of the noble lord lord bellwin on this amendment <e> <s> i am sure he has played a very great part in the change of mind by the government <e> <s> i have always found him most sympathetic and supportive of the concept of an independent and impartial system of investigation of statutory bodies providing essential monopoly services <e> <s> the committee is i am sure grateful to the noble lord for the gracious way in which the government have yielded tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords if the finances of the association are not being questioned why is the grant being held to a period of six months <e>", "<cs> i do not wish unduly to prolong the debate on this amendment which the noble lord lord sandford has explained so clearly and in such detail and which has been fully supported by my noble friend lady fisher of rednal <e> <s> however following the comments of the noble lord lord mottistone a few moments ago i feel that i must stress the need to include subsection g of the amendment of the noble lord lord sandford in legislation rather than in guidelines because the extension of the ability to refer matters to the ombudsman and the members of <e>", "<cs> i wish briefly to correct a misunderstanding <e> <s> the noble lord lord skelmersdale indicated that i and the noble lord lord sandford through subsection g of the amendment were seeking to extend access to the ombudsman <e> <s> if only that were so <e> <s> i could make a persuasive case to the committee to allow the individual citizen direct access to the ombudsman as people have in all countries other than in the united kingdom and france <e> <s> i was seeking only to say in my earlier remarks that unless the amendment were included on the face of the bill the reorganisation of the water industry would restrict the access of the individual to the ombudsman because of the very few members who will remain on the new appointed authorities through whom the citizens can make their complaints <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to detain the house much longer on this amendment but i must express my gratitude to noble lords who have spoken in support of amendment no <e> <s> and for the many points that have been made in relation to the right of the individual citizen to take his complaint to the local ombudsman <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount lord ridley has spoken the first words during our discussion on this bill that i have disagreed with <e> <s> so far i had found myself in total agreement with all that he said <e> <s> as one of those who put their name to this amendment i am sure the noble baroness lady faithfull with her great record in both statutory and voluntary social services will agree with me that this amendment does not seek to give special privilege to the services that are named in the amendment <e> <s> on the contrary i think that our anxiety stems and those of the voluntary organisation stem from the need to give special help to all those in the community who need the help of these particular services <e> <s> certainly in my experience in both the statutory and the voluntary sector that has never been resented by the other services in local government <e>", "<cs> but if the government are determined and so it seems through the passage of this bill to limit the overall amount that local authorities spend as every housewife knows if you bake a smaller cake the slices will be smaller and you may not be able to give one to everybody <e> <s> that is why i fear for the future of the voluntary organisations in local areas <e>", "<cs> my lords as a member of sub-committee c i must first express my warmest thanks to the noble lord lord seebohm for the skill patience and courtesy with which he steered the subcommittee through the masses of both written and oral evidence on all our deliberations which resulted in the presentation of this report this evening <e> <s> the noble lord has presented it in his typically clear and concise manner which all of us can only admire <e> <s> i have of course known the noble lord lord seebohm for nearly years <e> <s> we first met to undertake the inquiry into the local authority and allied personal social services <e> <s> his skills of chairmanship are always a pleasure to those of us who serve with him on sub-committee c indeed the whole house owes him a debt of gratitude not only for the particular report that we are considering tonight but for all those that have been issued under his chairmanship of sub-committee c on education employment and social policy in the eec in the years that he has chaired the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord can touch on the point that the noble baroness lady faithfull has raised <e> <s> would a woman in receipt of a widows pension be regarded as drawing benefit and therefore be eligible for the community programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to return to this point but i think it is an important one <e> <s> i am still not clear from the noble lords reply whether a widows pension is regarded as a benefit for the purposes of entry to the community programme scheme <e>", "<cs> i should perhaps preface my strong support for these amendments by declaring a personal interest in a secure and stable future for the ilea in that i have four grandchildren currently being educated at an ilea primary school and i myself am a product of the london education service <e> <s> but perhaps more important and relevant to the issues which the committee currently has under consideration is my direct experience of the nature scale and complexity of the education service in inner london ranging as it does from nursery schools and nursery classes through primary and secondary schools to further and higher education as a result of my membership of the lcc education committee continuously over a period of some years followed by a further period of three years as vice chairman of the education committee of the inner london education authority when it was first established in <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to take part in this debate on behalf of my noble friend lady llewelyn-davies of hastoe the chairman of the european communities committee <e> <s> unfortunately she is unwell and therefore unable to be present with us for this debate tonight <e> <s> i know that the whole house would wish to send her its very best wishes for a rapid recovery <e> <s> as your lordships know she always attends the debates on our reports but only on rare occasions does she feel the need to add to the excellent work of the committees <e> <s> but she saw this occasion as one on which she should speak because as i shall explain it concerns the whole process of the scrutiny of european legislation by your lordships house and she greatly regrets her inability to be present <e>", "<cs> my lords the house and particuarly those noble lords who are waiting to speak on matters raised in the unstarred question of the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones which is to follow this debate will be glad to hear that i do not intend to make another long speech today <e> <s> although i am sorely tempted to comment on some of the points that have been made in this wide-ranging debate on our report i shall simply confine myself to thanking all those noble lords and noble baronesses who have taken part in what i believe has been a valuable and constructive debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first thank the noble earl for his concern for my welfare <e> <s> i only hope that the high temperatures on the first floor compared with the low temperatures in the chamber will not have affected it adversely <e> <s> i must also thank him for his reply to my amendment although i know that he will understand when i say how deeply disappointed i am to hear the same old arguments that have been dragged out for the past years whenever this subject has been tackled <e>", "<cs> my lords in introducing this debate the noble lord lord seebohm has drawn the attention of the house to the longstanding aim of the ec endorsed by the heads of state and government of fontainbleau in june to make a reality of a europe without frontiers and with his usual clarity and competence he has explained some of the fiscal problems involved in completing the internal market by in accordance with the white paper of the noble lord lord cockfield <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether consideration is being given to publishing the reports of the consumer consultative committee in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether in their consideration of these matters the government have given special attention to the particular problem pointed out to the select committee namely that in the uk it would be essential that the benefit of any directive should extend to those whose professional qualifications as opposed to their academic qualifications are recognised by charter or by other self-regulating bodies as opposed to state authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i just intervene briefly to say how delighted i am to learn from the noble earl that the government are prepared at long last to accept this amendment <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey said the case for direct access to the local ombudsman has been argued both inside and outside this house for some years <e> <s> it is certainly a great pleasure to me as founder chairman of the commission for local administration to know that this improvement is now going to be made in the legislation <e> <s> i must also thank the noble lord lord mcintosh and those noble lords who have supported both this amendment and previous ones on earlier legislation in that their efforts have come to this successful conclusion <e>", "<cs> i must thank the noble baroness lady hooper for her reply to my first amendment <e> <s> as she rightly said it widens the scope of the present provision in the bill and that of course was my deliberate intention <e> <s> i still maintain that the right for parents to be able to make such a complaint whether it is justified or not is a matter for the new machinery to decide is paramount <e> <s> however i appreciate that widening the scope of the provision in that way could cause certain complications which will need working out in rather greater detail <e> <s> therefore i warmly welcome the noble baronesss offer to reconsider the matter and hope that the government will come back to us at the next stage of the bills proceedings with a proposal much in line with my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will not be surprised to hear that i am extremely disappointed with the ministers reply <e> <s> that is because he failed completely to answer the points that i made in relation to the way in which the government have dealt with other services which have been removed from local authority control just as this bill removes schools which decide to opt out of local government control <e> <s> as regards his phrase the writ should not run here i should like to know whose dictum that is <e> <s> is it to be parliaments dictum in the light of the precedents that i have already quoted <e>", "<cs> my lords after the lengthy sittings that we have all endured in recent weeks i am sure that the house would not wish me to reply in great detail to the debate <e> <s> however i must thank my two colleagues the noble lords lord nathan and lord murray for their support and for their very interesting comments on the report today <e> <s> with regard to the noble lord lord ardwick i must confess that on a friday morning at the end of a very heavy week i hardly expected this topic to raise the political passions that would have been engendered by for example a debate on the common unit of currency the european financial area or even the subject of a central bank for the community <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful to the minister for his explanation <e> <s> the present commissions are under pressure especially the english commission because of the great increase in the number of complaints in recent years <e> <s> i must however confess that i am still a little puzzled as to what these advisers will do if they are not going to investigate complaints <e> <s> i say that because the commissions are relatively small organisations and in my experience are already extremely efficiently run <e> <s> nevertheless it is helpful to have on the record just what the government have in mind for these particular appointments <e> <s> i shall watch with interest to see how the proposal works out when these people are actually appointed <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment moved by my noble friend lord mcintosh of haringey which would enable the commissioners to investigate on their own initiative <e> <s> as he has said it is a well-founded proposal <e> <s> it was recommended in the earlier and later justice reports <e> <s> it is a power that exists in other jurisdictions in other parts of the world in common law countries commonwealth countries and countries on the continent of europe <e>", "<cs> in moving the amendment the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey mentioned the role of the representative bodies particularly in the early days of the establishment of the commissions in the local ombudsman system in <e> <s> it would be a pity when these representative bodies are being abolished not to take the opportunity to pay tribute to their work <e> <s> i do so with all my heart <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his detailed reply <e> <s> i entirely agree with him about the changed arrangements for the publication of the annual reports <e> <s> that is agreed all round <e> <s> however i did not hear him reply in any way to the arguments put forward by my noble friend lord mcintosh and myself about the use of the consolidated fund for the purpose of defraying the expenditure incurred each year by the commission <e> <s> that argument was not mentioned at all <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> like all other noble lords who have spoken on this amendment i have great sympathy for the case that the noble baroness lady stedman has put to the committee about the enforceability of the ombudsmans findings <e> <s> the account that she gave of the different recommendations that are made from time to time on this subject were absolutely accurate <e>", "<cs> my lords following the previous supplementary question is the noble lord aware that not only are the reports of the house of lords select committee on the european communities available to the european parliament but their contents pages are regularly translated into italian for the benefit of the italian senate <e> <s> is he also aware that the committees major report on fraud against the community was reprinted in full for the italian senate <e>", "<cs> my lords although as chairman of the european communities select committee i always attend debates on our reports it is only on rare occasions that i feel the need to add to the excellent work of the six specialist sub-committees which <e>"]
