["<cs> my lords having listened to most of the speeches this afternoon and when not listening reading that excellent book <e>", "<cs> my lords when i arrived in your noble lordships house earlier this afternoon and saw my name at the bottom of the list of speakers i was rather reminded of being back at school because then my name always appeared at the bottom of every list usually with the words twelfth man and the word scorer in brackets afterwards <e> <s> in the same way as a scorer is always enabled to watch every ball of a particular innings of his more illustrious colleagues as the last speaker i have been able to listen to the excellent and most interesting speeches of your lordships who know far more than i do about the heritage <e> <s> my own interest in the heritage is based on the fact that i live in a grade i listed historic house which is situated at the edge of a sssi in an area of outstanding natural beauty and sometimes i feel that if i sneeze too suddenly i shall do irreparable damage to the heritage <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be extremely brief as the evening is getting on <e> <s> a point about which i feel strongly is that my noble friend lord alport has felt it necessary to bring this bill notwithstanding the fact that the industry is trying to put its own house in order <e> <s> certainly in all the discussions i have had or attended since last summer farmers have been very well aware of the problems which were caused by the freak summer of last year <e> <s> but my noble friend still feels it necessary to introduce a bill to limit straw burning <e> <s> that therefore assumes that a number of farmers will wish to use the licences <e> <s> that point worries me considerably because with the best will in the world i cannot see how a local authority and i believe this point has been made by my noble friend lord radnor can in the height of the summer issue licences which they must obviously approve individually to a great many farmers in one particular district <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> i realise that when i spoke on second reading i failed to declare an interest <e> <s> unlike my noble friends on my right who are experienced farmers i am a farmer with an l plate on <e> <s> i got involved in the industry only months ago when one of my tenant farmers went bust <e> <s> i think it is very important to realise that farming is not so profitable as we are led to believe from some of these debates <e> <s> i have had to burn not only straw but docks couch grass and other horrible weeds <e>", "<cs> my lords last week i visited an art exhibition <e> <s> in one of the rooms there was a large placard which had the motto <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a short debate <e> <s> however i do not think i have ever managed to speak in your lordships house for more than five minutes and i do not intend to test my longevity record tonight <e> <s> i am a landowner but perhaps more importantly i act as my own land agent and apart from a having a number of farms and a commercial interest in the property my estate also owns the village which consists of some or dwellings the post office and the local pub <e> <s> thus i see every day at first-hand and hear about the problems of rural housing and employment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure to follow my noble friend lord tryon in that for many years he looked after my own familys investments <e> <s> he did that extraordinarily well <e> <s> it is the practice in your lordships house for one to declare any interest before speaking <e> <s> i am in some difficulty because at this moment of time i have no interest but by the time this debate is reported and is in your lordships hands i almost certainly will have an interest <e> <s> i hope your lordships will not ask me to elaborate because i could be accused of giving your lordships price-sensitive information <e> <s> although the stock exchange has another minutes before it closes this afternoon i should hate to be responsible for a stock exchange inquiry into your lordships dealing habits in the second reading of this bill <e>"]
