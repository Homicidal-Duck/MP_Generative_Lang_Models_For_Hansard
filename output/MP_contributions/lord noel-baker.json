["<cs> my lords i join in the congratulations to the noble lord lord carver and in conveying gratitude to my noble friend lord goronwy-roberts <e> <s> this has been largely a debate about rhodesia and

apologising profoundly for intervening in this debate during the earlier stages of which owing to circumstances over which i had no control i was not able to be present <e> <s> i must also apologise for my most discourteous attempt to intervene in the debate at a moment when i should not have done so <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down can he say a word about research on solar energy <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness agree that even if everything she proposed were carried out and i agreed i think with every word she said would not a great contribution be made to the purposes which she and many other noble lords have in view if the government made a reality of their declared policy of sport for all <e> <s> and if they want to make a reality of that declared policy could they not do it by making a down payment contribution <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to oppose the arguments of noble lords who have urged that our polaris submarines should be replaced in the early future by trident submarines with poseidon missiles <e> <s> i want to argue that the nato deterrent and our contribution to the nato deterrent are enormously greater than that which is required for deterrents are enormously greater than are required for any conceivable military purpose <e> <s> with respect to the noble lord lord gladwyn and to my noble friend lord ritchie-calder i think that they are very gravely underestimating the power of the submarine force which we now maintain <e> <s> i state it as i understand it if i go wrong the government will correct me <e>", "<cs>

consider that he has misunderstood what i said tonight and what i have said before <e> <s> i have never proposed that we should reduce our armaments or get rid of our offensive weapons before the russians or other nations do the same <e> <s> what i have proposed and what i urge upon him and upon the government is that our admirable foreign secretary who has spoken and worked for us all on the question of rhodesia should do the same in the united nations on the even more vitally important twin evils of the arms race and the world poverty with which the brandt report has dealt and that the noble lord lord carrington <e>", "<cs> my lords may i apologise to the house if my inexperience has led me into error <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down may i ask him whether or not he agrees that world armament expenditure is a major cause of the inflation of which he has spoken <e> <s> he has quoted the classical definition of inflation given by every economist since adam smith too much money chasing too few goods <e> <s> world armament expenditure has been running recently at more than million a year <e> <s> this enormous purchasing power in the hands of the members of the armed forces of the workers in armament factories and the manufacturers of arms comes out into the market with no goods whatsoever having been produced <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend whether he agrees as i said before that this is a factor which can be cured only by the world disarmament measures which the special session of the united nations put forward in <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank all noble lords who have taken part in what has been a very valuable debate <e> <s> in particular i thank my noble friend lord ritchie for his remarkable and brilliant maiden speech and my noble

reflected without reaching a firm view <e> <s> however i have found the arguments put forward in your lordships chamber this afternoon extremely persuasive most of all the masterly statement by the mover of the amendment in favour of what he proposed as well as the other speeches from those who have high personal authority in the matter <e>", "<cs> i had a singularly beautiful speech that i hoped to make on this amendment <e> <s> i shall not make it <e> <s> i want first to say that it seemed to me with all respect that the observations made by the minister in opposition to the amendment proved the case for its adoption <e> <s> in effect he was saying that there are so many things to be dealt with that this matter of world development will certainly be pushed out and i believe that it will be pushed out unless this amendment is carried <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the ministers last answer but two virtually admit that there is no real defence against nerve gases <e> <s> is not the most significant international reform now <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for that reply may i ask whether he is aware that years ago when the bbc first suppressed this film the director wrote to me saying that the impact would be so terrible that if they showed it fathers would kill their children and mothers would jump out of windows <e> <s> however that did not prevent the bbc from selling the film to private societies for exhibition <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that it has now been seen by perhaps half a million people and no fathers have killed their children or mothers jumped out of windows <e> <s> is he further aware that it has been sold to the german education

possible for german children to see it <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that owing to a long-standing engagement i shall be obliged to leave the chamber soon after i sit down <e> <s> i offer my apologies to noble lords who will speak later in the debate <e> <s> my lords two stories that are true <e> <s> a friend in europe a former minister the other day asked his army chief of staff whether it was really true that nato had prepared a plan for war in which a hundred million people would be killed on the first day <e> <s> a hundred million <e> <s> replied the general a hundred million ridiculous <e> <s> forty million at the most <e> <s> not long ago the noble lord who was then our minister for civil defence spoke to the nation on radio <e> <s> i quote the verbatim text of what he said <e> <s> speaking for the government he said <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down may i ask him a question <e> <s> he founded a good deal of his argument on the events of the s <e> <s> does he recall that in sir winston churchill said this war the second world war could easily have been prevented if the league of nations had been used with courage and loyalty <e> <s> does he recall that it was the betrayal of the league over abyssinia which made the second world war and that that betrayal was carried out by french and british militarists and appeasers <e>", "<cs> my lords i follow the noble lord who has just sat down in saying that we must try and try and try again for multilateral disarmament <e> <s> i think that was the only thing that he said with which i found myself in full agreement <e> <s> but i was in complete agreement with the noble lord lord zuckerman who said with his great authority that the average size of the nuclear weapon today is a little under one megaton that a one-megaton bomb exploded above birmingham would utterly destroy the city and kill people that if a nuclear exchange begins it is virtually certain that it will mean the end of our civilisation and that reliance on deterrence is a very dangerous gamble <e>", "<cs> my lords i quoted my noble friend lord peart then the leader of the house as saying that polaris had many years of effective life yet and that was only three years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords the scientific and technical achievements of our century have been very remarkable indeed conquest of the skies by aircraft colour television the release of atomic energy the greatest miracle of all and mans journey to the moon <e> <s> but the historians of the future if there is a future and there are historians will not be mainly concerned with our scientific advances <e> <s> they will regard as vitally important in our century the evolution of international institutions <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not follow the noble lord who has just sat down in his most interesting speech except to support his conclusion that we cannot afford the erosion of the resources given to transport <e> <s> may i begin by paying tribute to the admirable speeches of the noble viscount lord sidmouth and my noble friend lord underhill who spoke from the opposition front bench <e> <s> i want to support their plea for new and larger investment in the railways system <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to ask him two questions <e> <s> first would he favour modest investment in the narrow waterways in order to improve them for recreational purposes <e> <s> they might serve the most important interests of those who like to be on water <e> <s> secondly would the noble viscount think it still practical and advantageous to do what we used to urge during the war link the trent to the severn by a wide narrow canal bypassing birmingham and link the severn to the mersey by a new wide canal which would join up the north-western traffic centres to birmingham and nottingham and the east <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the gain from importing cheap coal from america is largely offset by the loss from public funds due to payment of unemployment benefit to the miners displaced <e> <s> is it not the case that the strike now projected will cause a further catastrophic financial loss <e> <s> would it not be financial common sense to suspend the closures now planned until the new pits have been opened to take up the labour displaced <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin with a profound apology for having missed the earlier stages of this debate <e> <s> it happened as a result of a foolish accident <e> <s> my watch stopped i was working on what i hoped to say and then found that i was lamentably behind time <e> <s> i should like to express my warm agreement with the speech which has been delivered by the noble lord who has just sat down <e> <s> in a recent debate i tried to show that trident would have no advantages over polaris as a means of deterrent if deterrence is a real policy at all <e> <s> i examined the alleged advantages of trident its greater range its greater accuracy the greater yield of its warhead and i think i proved to demonstration reading my speech again it seems to me that i proved to demonstration that polaris would inflict such totally unacceptable damage

closed shop and made his works a closed shop <e> <s> he was followed as chairman of the company by my two elder brothers who both shared his view <e> <s> i shared it then i share it now <e>", "<cs> my lords my father would have invited him to join <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness recognise that our standards in education affecting school age site of classes and so on are much below those of other leading nations including the united states canada and japan <e> <s> since education will represent the true greatness of our nation in the years to come i am talking of or years from now <e>", "<cs> my lords i venture with respect to congratulate the noble lord the minister on introducing this bill and on the lucid and persuasive speech which he made for its introduction <e> <s> i want if i may to speak as the last two noble lords have done on what i regard as the gravest of the social evils by which our nation is afflicted today i mean the tragedy of death and mutilation on the roads <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i should have said chairs <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene for one moment only to voice my warm support for the bill <e> <s> i should like to add one detail to the very interesting list of practical suggestions made by the noble baroness lady macleod about people who walk with the aid of crutches or sticks <e> <s> she did not add the necessity of having handrails on staircases <e> <s> that is a facility that i often miss in daily life in the buildings around which i walk in london today <e> <s> a few years ago i had a very heavy fall in what is known as the palace of the united nations in geneva <e> <s> i fell down seven marble steps where there was no handrail <e> <s> that left me with a permanent injury <e> <s> this is an important point and i

sits down <e> <s> i am not quite sure that i have understood everything that he has just said but i would ask him whether before report stage he will consider the proposal to make it obligatory on motor-cyclists to have a rear light <e> <s> i believe rear lights are of the very greatest significance <e> <s> many years ago when i was parliamentary secretary to the ministry of war transport i had to pass through the house of commons a bill making rear lights compulsory for pedal cyclists <e> <s> i was most vigorously opposed by the national cyclists union who assured me that they would end my political career if i persisted in what i proposed <e> <s> i persisted the bill was passed the lights were made compulsory my political <e>", "<cs> i should like to know whether before the report stage we can consider again the suggestion which i understood the noble lord lord underhill to make that there should be compulsory provision of seat belts for children in the back seat <e> <s> if i recall rightly and the minister will correct me if i am wrong on second reading he said something to the effect that it would be a desirable arrangement to have scat belts for children on the back seat but that it would be too expensive <e> <s> i submit that expense is not a consideration that should be taken into account in such a matter <e> <s> if children sustain injury in the back seat as they sometimes do it may result in brain damage in facial disfigurement or in being crippled for life <e> <s> that is a handicap to the child and perhaps a burden to the public purse which could be avoided if the right seat belts were found for children for the rear seat <e> <s> i ask the minister to consider that matter again <e>", "<cs> my lords may i support what was said by the noble lord who has just sat down <e> <s> when i was in the other place in charge of nationalised industries coal gas and electricity i had a dispute with the late lord morrison the then herbert morrison about answering questions there on day-to-day management <e> <s> in fact i never refused to answer a single question put to me by any member of another place <e> <s> the table never made any trouble and i always found it of the utmost advantage both to the nationalised board and to the other place to have the fullest information given at question time which anyone could ask for <e>", "<cs> my lords i venture to support what has been said by my noble friends <e> <s> i am not competent to comment on the drafting of the amendments i want only to express a sense of grave concern at the thought of sales of forest land by the forestry commission and the diminution of the area of our country under forests <e> <s> i remember the creation of the forestry commission not by a socialist government as a socialist reform of the utmost necessity and benefit to the nation as a whole <e> <s> i have admired without limit the work of the forestry commission although i have not always admired some of its results <e> <s> i have known the work of the commission in cumbria better than elsewhere <e> <s> when the valley of emerdale was planted with conifers i was one of those who thought that perhaps the lovely landscape of that valley where there is the great pillar of rock which i have so often climbed was not improved but beyond all doubt the increase in forest land in cumbria was of great benefit to that area and to the nation as a whole <e> <s> i should like to express the hope that the warning will be borne in mind that if we continue cutting forests at the rate at which we are cutting them today we may find that in years time we are almost without any forest land at all <e> <s> i hope most ardently that the government will listen to the protests which have been made and will change their policies <e>", "<cs> my lords would the government consider making it a matter of high priority to disseminate full information about the facts of world poverty and hunger which are so lamentably unknown in most of the advanced countries of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join my noble friend on the opposition front bench in congratulating the noble baroness in charge of the bill and thanking the government for what they have done <e> <s> i rise to draw attention to a consideration which i hope the government will keep in mind when preparing circulars in consultation with those responsible for the administration of the bill <e> <s> it concerns a danger affecting disabled people who are not so disabled that they require a wheelchair but who are not entirely mobile <e> <s> the danger is that they may suffer a fall <e> <s> at an earlier stage i drew attention to the danger posed by stairs and steps which have no handrails <e> <s> since then i have been taking note of the numerous places in this building and elsewhere where there are steps without handrails <e> <s> this is a point of major importance <e> <s> i myself should be relatively mobile

because there were no handrails <e> <s> other things can be done to guard against the danger of falls and i hope that the government will bear the point in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i am in order in making some observations arising from the speech of the noble lord who speaks for the government <e> <s> i thought that he was extremely persuasive in his account of the precuations that are to be taken to ensure that the machines are fair to the driver <e> <s> nevertheless i would support the amendment put forward by my noble friend on the opposition front bench if he presses it to a division <e> <s> but i venture to make an observation before the vote is taken <e> <s> we are dealing with drunken driving <e> <s> drunken driving is a matter of the very highest importance <e> <s> if we want to reduce the appalling toll of death and mutilation on the roads drunken driving is one matter on which vigorous action must be taken <e> <s> i speak with feeling because my own driving career was finished by a drunken driver who struck my car sideways on against the back wheel axle at miles an hour <e> <s> he destroyed both his own car and my car <e> <s> he spent the night in a

illiberal would be to allow people not to wear seat belts when the results are known to be disastrous both to the driver and to his passengers <e> <s> the case is proven <e>", "<cs> i do wish to continue my lords because the point is one of very great importance <e> <s> the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth spoke slightingly about what he called the so-called serious cases of injury and mutilation due to road accidents and implied that a very large proportion of the serious accidents were not serious at all they simply had to be reported to hospital and were then dismissed <e> <s>

conservative policy of making the rich richer and the poor poorer <e> <s> it has been tried before during my long lifetime it has never produced the national prosperity which is promised when the measures are adopted <e>", "<cs> my lords i am greatly obliged to my noble friend for his kind assistance <e> <s> i submit with respect to the noble lord on the government bench that i am in fact discussing unemployment which is now a vital issue for so many millions of our population in this country <e> <s> i was saying that armament production is normally or often regarded as good for trade

which show that a billion dollars invested in armament production generate jobs for a year but a billion dollars invested in civil employment in housing in goods in furniture in television sets in motor-cars generate not but jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him to consider that in much of what he has said he has himself contributed to the false idea which he says the soviet union have that our disarmament movements are unilateral <e> <s> will be accept my assurance that the overwhelming majority of the campaign which is having sweeping success stands for the general disarmament of the final document of the first special session of the united nations general assembly in which is multilateral disarmament the disarmament of east and west and the demilitarisation of the world which is so urgently required <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with other noble lords in expressing my gratitude to the noble earl who opened this debate <e> <s> i rise to offer a view which i formed many years ago when i was close friends with a man whom some noble lords will remember colonel borden-turner who for years was governor of wormwood scrubs <e> <s> in my

offenders were in prison only by accident that they were essentially good men who desired to live by the law and be good citizens <e> <s> he said of course we all know it happens that a long term of imprisonment can turn a good man into a confirmed criminal for life <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to support my noble friend lord taylor of gryfe and to thank him for what i thought was a very remarkable speech which he made this afternoon <e> <s> i find it difficult to believe that any noble lord would not be converted in favour of the bill by what my noble friend said <e> <s> i have taken

spontaneous british and international democratic demand for the fulfilment of the policy of the final document of the special session of the united nations in namely multilateral world disarmament

government with leaders of soviet nongovernmental organisations and with ordinary russian citizens the men and women in the street and i can summarise my conclusions in three points which i shall state quite shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords i answer to the noble lord that of course we are all agreed that it is regrettable that the soviet union do not take the same view of human rights as we take <e> <s> however i would add that when world disarmament is carried out and when the soviet people are freed from the burden of the war economy with which they are now saddled much more will be done

personal gratitude in writing <e> <s> at this hour i do not want to add further observations except to say that i agree with noble lords who have said that the policy of world disarmament is

in moving a motion which i regard as of the highest importance and i support noble lords who have urged that the government should bring in an early bill to carry through the reforms which the pearson report puts forward <e> <s> i believe it is self-evidently true that the defects of the law of tort should be remedied and that a no-negligence compensation system should be introduced <e> <s> i believe it is pre-eminently desirable that million or more if it be required should be found to give proper compensation to the victims of road accidents <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him two questions <e> <s> he spoke of the increase in public expenditure <e> <s> does the noble lord appreciate with the intensity which it deserves the fact that public expenditure would put right what is now a very grave social injustice to people who suffer great hardship <e> <s> secondly does the noble lord realise that the outstandingly important financial fact

dispute with the argentine we should make concessions to the argentine in any way we properly can if the negotiations show any chance of reaching success <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble viscount sits down may i ask him a question <e> <s> he says that it is vital that the argentinian aggression should not succeed in other words that the argentinian forces must be withdrawn in accordance with
