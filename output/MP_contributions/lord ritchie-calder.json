["<cs> my lords could the noble lord tell the house what the attitude of the british government is <e>", "<cs> my lords i make no apology even at this late hour for trying to repair what has been an omission there are many of them of course in the very complex issues we have been discussing today <e> <s> like my right honourable friend the leader of the opposition in another place i had great difficulty in finding the reference to overseas aid in the gracious speech <e> <s> it is there all right all words <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord lord mottistone that i am not going to read my last will and testament into <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to take part again in this discussion and to follow the noble lord lord buxton of alsa in bringing this question to the attention of your lordships <e> <s> i should like to deal first with the last point raised by the noble lord lord tanlaw which is that we must wait for the slowest in the convoy in international affairs <e> <s> that is basically true <e> <s> most of the developing countries which are now properly arguing their case in the law of the sea conference in which i am pretty heavily involved are in fact not fully aware of the risks which we are now discussing <e> <s> on the other hand as the noble lord lord buxton has pointed out events are taking place very near home in the north sea <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate the noble lord lord armstrong upon his maiden speech and express the hope that we shall hear him many times in the future <e> <s> we are talking today about an energy crisis but i should like to suggest to your lordships that this is not a crisis it is a climacteric <e> <s> in fact we are now approaching a point of no return <e> <s> this is the end or the beginning of the end of liquid fuel <e> <s> that is to say we are to move towards a stage in which essential energy will have to come in a form other than the convenient form which is comparatively recent in which oil is put into internal combustion engines <e> <s> this is a statement of fact <e> <s> we are moving away from oil as simply a convenient portable form of fuel which happens to suit us in the car age the areoplane age indeed the age of the internal combustion engine <e>", "<cs> my lords let us be quite clear the fifth meeting of the united nations conference on trade and development was an ominous fiasco the more ominous because the omens were obvious and were ignored <e> <s> we have had a discussion here this afternoon for five hours in which we have been talking about the energy crisis into which we ourselves have been brought as a result of the operations of opec <e> <s> surely you learn what the lessons of opec are <e> <s> we cannot imagine that the relations from now on between the rich nations and what have been called the less developed will ever be the same again <e> <s> we have seen countries which were meaningless deserts years ago emerge as the rich oil states <e> <s> the beggar whom we turned away from our gates turns up years later to foreclose the mortgage on the estate <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise that my name does not appear on the list of speakers but i have been out of the country and was not sure whether i would be back in time for this important and critical debate <e> <s> at least i want to stand up and be counted <e> <s> the remarks of the noble lord lord chalfont about the relative importance of military and political economies reminded me of how during the war i had a pretty heavy commitment as the director of plans and operations for political warfare <e> <s> we that is to say myself the noble lord lord gladwyn the noble lord lord weidenfeld and many others were trying to build up what we called rather pretentiously the fourth fighting arm <e> <s> that was the political warfare element and an important part of that was the bbc and its overseas services <e>", "<cs> my lords i commiserate with the noble lord lord trefgarne in his now recognisable role as the receiver in political bankruptcy <e> <s> he was the spokesman on the question of the world service of the bbc <e> <s> he had to defend an indefensible case <e> <s> today once again he is the spokesman and the present government have abandoned any attempt to appeal to heart and mind they have abolished the mind by withdrawing access to it and they have forgotten the heart <e> <s> this is a matter that i find most regrettable not just as regards the high moral level to which my noble friend the right reverend prelate lord soper and many other speakers referred <e> <s> in a sense it is much more than that because that would be unreal unless we meant what we said that is unless we backed it up by positive policies <e>", "<cs> my lords of course not <e> <s> what we are talking about here should be basically a disinterested service a disinterested recognition that we must invest in order to recover on these investments <e> <s> that can only happen <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try to emulate the noble viscount <e> <s> i should like to thank the right reverend prelate for giving us this debate and in particular for drawing the attention of the house and i hope giving it much wider publicity to this excellent study by the council for science and society <e> <s> they have done something i have been anxious should be done for a great many years <e> <s> i mean that it is excellent <e> <s> it is informative and one can turn to it like a handbook to get information on the present status of various alternative sources as well as nuclear energy oil and coal <e> <s> by and large i accept the evaluations of the existing status <e> <s> i would add that that status might be changed if government <e>", "<cs> my lords i take off exactly from where the noble lord lord gladwyn left off <e> <s> i adjure our friends i hope that they are our friends at least i adjure the government to take this opportunity to get rid of something which is now becoming completely meaningless by any analysis not just by sentiment <e> <s> in this season of the year if one goes around the toy shops one will be struck by the fact that all the toys now being produced for intelligent children are board games monopoly to train little capitalists or war games to train militarists <e> <s> but at least they are fun games <e> <s> we are talking tonight about something that is not funny and is not a game but you can do exactly what the children do you can deploy redeploy you can toss dice do this and that <e>", "<cs> no that has been recalculated <e> <s> inflation has taken place since last sunday when that was published in the paper <e> <s> we are talking of those orders of magnitude <e> <s> your lordships realise that in that picture the component for which we are paying four polarises possibly five tridents would mean that in terms of potential we should be about per cent <e> <s> of the russian retaliation potential <e> <s> work it out my lords <e> <s> you can do the numbers game we all play it <e> <s> it means however you act that you are putting up a little roman candle in a sort of ultimate defiance and it will not be noticed anyway because by that time the world will have moved to its ultimate destruction <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join noble lords who have spoken in their sympathy with the noble lord lord ballantrae in the loss of his wife a very distinguished woman in her own right <e> <s> i want to follow the noble lord lord home regarding how far by dedication to the english language we can <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad that i am in a position to follow the noble lord lord monson <e> <s> i was afraid that we were going to have such a chorus of support for metrication that we would lose the authentic voice of those who in very small numbers but very loudly have been shouting and screaming at us over the last years <e> <s> when we were facing opposition to metrication i encountered in the other house members of parliament who were totally opposed to it <e> <s> they were divided between those whom i call the folklorists like the noble lord lord monson and those who were saying as the noble baroness lady white pointed out that this was a devious device for dragging us into the common market <e>", "<cs> my lords we are coming now to the world of microchip computers <e> <s> how on earth are the children going to cope <e> <s> how can they see any sense in their elders who insist upon lumbering them with this nonsense <e> <s> i agree that if we had not started it we would not be in the mess we are in now but the fact is that we started it and we are in a mess out of which we have got to get quickly <e>", "<cs> my lords genuinely before the noble lord sits down may i ask him whether there was any significance in a slip of the tongue by him when he called the metrication board the metrification board <e> <s> i did not know that we had if back into metrication <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad and grateful that the noble lord lord kennet has introduced this subject once again <e> <s> as he pointed out it is almost four years to the day indeed i think it was yesterday since we had an effective debate on this subject <e> <s> it was introduced on that occasion by the noble baroness lady white in the absence of the noble lord lord henley <e> <s> since then as has been pointed out and i measure my words carefully we have had at least a symbolic bracketing of the departments under the noble lord the lord privy seal <e> <s> i am sure that they did quite a lot of the work but it was not very evident in the displayed activities of the separate departments which they did not rule or direct <e> <s> i find it very disturbing that now in the absence of that bracket or committee as i would call it we are now seeing quite clearly that the lead in this matter is being taken by the department of trade <e>", "<cs> my lords i join your lordships and the previous speaker lord vernon in congratulating the noble lord lord chorley on his excellent maiden speech <e> <s> we hope that we shall hear him many times <e> <s> the brandt report is very significant <e> <s> as the papers very properly say it is the most important document which has been produced in britain this year <e> <s> but it is more than that <e> <s> it is an historic docu <e>", "<cs> my lords thank you very much i shall take the hint and keep to seven and a half minutes <e> <s> it is only two minutes less than i usually speak <e> <s> i want again to embarrass the noble earl lord lauderdale by saying how much i agree with him <e> <s> he is going <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister please affirm our concern that during the discussions whatever may result from the council of ministers they will bear in mind what the noble lord lord avebury said that this is not a matter which concerns merely the community it is not a matter which concerns a country it is a vast international problem with very large impending developments <e> <s> we have been talking reassuringly and i am sure that everyone here will be reassured by the fact that up to now the matter has been handled fairly responsibly <e> <s> indeed as the noble lord lord ashby pointed out this was on the initiative of the scientists themselves <e> <s> but we are now moving into commercial development and that is where we really need <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that we are now going into the field of commercial development and that it is important that we should have all the safeguards that we can possibly secure <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great privilege to follow those noble lords who have spoken in the debate for which we are very grateful and may i say to my noble friend lord noel-baker how much this has contributed to what is the aim and object certainly of those of us who are with him in the campaign for world disarmament <e> <s> i am also very grateful for and acknowledge my admiration of the maiden speech of the noble lord lord ritchie of dundee <e> <s> at least i have a half namesake <e> <s> i am very grateful not only for his speech but for the fact that in case there should be any confusion he and i are i believe practically speaking the same language <e> <s> so if he gets my cuttings he will not have to take libel action <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend in moving this amendment and in protest against this whole attitude of stop the world and let us get off <e> <s> this is what it is all about <e> <s> we are contracting out of the real world <e> <s> the clauses involved are enabling clauses they enable the scottish development agency for example to do the kind of things that some of us in scotland want to promote <e> <s> again i would repeat what was said <e> <s> this is not charity it is constructive development intended to promote scottish interests we are talking about the scottish development agency and also as he pointed out very clearly whatever the development agency or the national enterprise board or anybody else proposed to do this meant that we were in fact consciously creating work for private enterprise in scotland <e> <s> some of us have been very deeply concerned in this because we have tried and have quite substantially succeeded in promoting the development which i want to see in the developing countries done not as charity but as positive investment and encouragement to the industries involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not follow my good friend lord boothby into the question of government control <e> <s> i am going to follow on government example <e> <s> what we are talking about now as has been pointed out by my noble friend lord ross is the result of the general practices and precepts now being adopted by the government <e> <s> this is a cut across the board the sort of thing which is utterly and totally meaningless <e> <s> this is something which has been forced upon the bbc or they say it has been forced upon the bbc by the necessity for economy <e> <s> as has been said the economies are imposed on the corporation and here i am defending the corporation by the fact that inflation has made the scale and costs of their productions more expensive <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl agree that this process <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that information <e> <s> it reassures me and i hope that it will also reassure others <e> <s> anyway as i pointed out <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw my motion for papers <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank my noble friend lord lever of manchester for giving us the opportunity for this debate <e> <s> i propose to be very brief and i apologise if it is necessary for me to leave before the end of the debate <e> <s> no one has ever accused me of being interested in money it is one of my great failings one of my greatest weaknesses <e> <s> i do not pretend to understand about finance but i do pretend to be <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank the noble lord lord buxton of alsa for returning to the problem of oil pollution of the north sea <e> <s> indeed i am grateful to him for concentrating on this particular aspect at a time when we might be beginning to develop some complacency about the general picture <e>", "<cs> my lords i follow the noble baroness in saying that the answer to the middle east problem i am sure is in the settlement of the israeli problem <e> <s> it is pivotal to the whole question <e> <s> it is also a paramount consideration <e> <s> thirty years ago when we were looking for answers for all the problems now magnified and multiplied in the world today i went for unesco to israel to see what they were doing about the restoration of the deserts <e> <s> i then wrote a pamphlet called <e>", "<cs> my lords i always find it very difficult to follow my noble friend lord donald soper because i feel so totally inadequate <e> <s> but i want to take up from him where he left off <e> <s> beyond any question whatever as lord carrington pointed out in mexico the situation we are facing throughout the world in economic terms is much more serious than our anxieties which we may be able to avert about the situation in iran or the situation in afghanistan <e> <s> this lemming-like process towards an economic collapse is visible and clear <e> <s> all the time we are saying when and how <e> <s> it is not a question of now or if it is when and how <e>", "<cs> i want to support the noble lord lord ferrier on this <e> <s> as he pointed out this is keeping the doors open <e> <s> it is important when we initiate a new service that we emphasise and make quite clear that we want to make the proceedings of parliament clearly understood by the people in this country <e> <s> i mean clearly and physically understood <e> <s> the noble lord lord hill himself suggested that this will require a new expertise and better methods of presentation but technically there is no doubt that this is part of what could be the innovative process of the fourth channel <e>", "<cs> i want strongly to support this amendment and to support my noble friend lord hatch of lusby <e> <s> i am glad to follow the right reverend prelate and his appeal for the moral attitude which should be brought to this amendment <e> <s> i think that what the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware how much ill feeling is being engendered about the attitude of the british government at this special assembly <e> <s> is he also aware that the new economic order with or without capital letters is no longer a matter of rhetoric but of burning necessity <e> <s> what are the government proposing to do about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have liked to follow the right reverend prelate on the question of aid to developing countries but i am impelled to follow the noble lord lord home because his theme is i hope my theme but with a different emphasis <e> <s> i was very gratified to read in the queens speech the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not having put my name down to speak but i am moved to do so on account of the speeches which have been made which i think is probably the best reason for intervening in a debate <e> <s> i want to take up some of the points on which i shall he brief because i feel that they are cardinal to the whole question of what we are going through not just in terms of massive unemployment but on the whole basis of industry because massive unemployment is now becoming the bog into which the basis of our industry is disappearing <e> <s> therefore we must look for new ways in which to use this opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not detain your lordships apart from thanking very much everyone who took part and thanking also the minister for his response supplementing very constructively what we have been talking about <e> <s> i would say that what we have done here tonight is a bit of fly-casting and simply alerting i hope everyone concerned in this house to the fact that we must pay more attention to the united nations and its agencies <e> <s> we do not want to go through this performance again in the sense of simply having a quick look round the shop as it were <e> <s> we ought systematically to ask ourselves what is really happening <e> <s> we know little about it as the noble lord has said <e> <s> some of us know more than we are able to impart <e> <s> the fact is we must do something about it <e> <s> i accept what the minister said about the figures in the united nations but what i want to see far more is in this country a regeneration of that vitality that we had in the s <e> <s> the noble lord referred to imco <e> <s> i am serving notice that i want a debate on the implications of the law of the sea conference and i hope that we can find time for its full discussion <e> <s> i thank your lordships very much and i beg leave to withdraw my motion for papers <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much doubt whether we are entitled to be discussing this bill at all <e> <s> noble lords will see that we are talking about the deep seabed which means <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> it seems to me to he strange that we can talk about dirty water about wasting water but i never knew it exhausted the molecule of water <e> <s> i do not see what happens to a molecule of water when it passes through a generating plant which would deprive it from further use <e> <s> since all of us in this room are still breathing molecules of oxygen which julius ceasar breathed when he crossed to england i do not know whose water we would be using in the generators to come <e>", "<cs> i too want to support the amendment in the same terms as my noble friend lady jeger <e> <s> i too was a professional reporter and a court reporter and a pretty efficient shorthand writer <e> <s> i thought it was very commendable if i checked my shorthand against the documents of the court <e> <s> is it to be alleged that had i been imperfect in my shorthand i was committing a crime by checking my shorthand against a document <e>", "<cs> since the noble and learned lord the lord advocate of scotland has spoken may i intervene as a scottish crime reporter <e> <s> i think what we are discussing here from a long experience of reporting crime raises all the issues which i suggest my noble friend has raised <e> <s> as a crime reporter and i am talking now not about the responsibility of editors but people finding and deploying the facts you are forced into the most incredible situations if you do not know where you stand <e>", "<cs> my lords i will follow the admirable example of the previous speakers by being very brief but i am intervening i am not a member of the sub-committee because i want to point out that what lord alexander of potterhill has been saying is absolutely crucial <e> <s> the fact that this might be <e>", "<cs> i too support the amendment because we are pre-empting the future something we should not be doing <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house i had to include that because it was my deference to the government that at least they would recognise that there was a need for an environmental impact a recognition <e> <s> i did not know any other way of doing it <e> <s> it is purely my inadequacy in drafting <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for those remarks and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that one of the most important contributions we could make would be to reinforce the united nations disaster agency <e> <s> we have had the complaints <e> <s> why do we not see whether we can repair these complaints <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the united states action which was unquestionably taken at the behest of the deep sea mining interests has certainly postponed indefinitely and probably destroyed the possibility of setting up the international seabed authority which authority was to administer the licensing and management of the seabed mineral reserves <e> <s> is the minister also aware of the implications for the deep sea mining ironically called temporary provisions bill which your lordships passed through this house which purports to license the exploration and exploitation <e>", "<cs> of the quite unmeasurable wealth of the seabed and which admits that it has no terms of reference <e> <s> the bill states explicitly that it is not claiming these rights <e> <s> it is simply an acknowledgment that anybody else has sovereignty <e>", "<cs> the question i want to put <e>", "<cs> is this will the minister remind his right honourable colleague the secretary of state for industry who is sponsoring the bill that in this process he is making himself an accessory before the fact in the biggest smash-and-grab in history since the berlin convention which carved up africa <e>", "<cs> my lords it is extremely difficult to follow in this debate because of the distinction of the speeches <e> <s> i believe this is a climacteric debate and that what we are talking about at this moment is going to be a point of departure in the history of our whole education system <e> <s> it is extremely difficult even to attempt to equate with the speeches which have been made here <e> <s> i must say how much i welcome the maiden speech by my ex-vice-chancellor the noble lord lord swann <e> <s> it was a charming speech which had wit humour and substance and as we always say we hope to hear from the noble lord again <e> <s> in fact i can promise that you will <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government please encourage the six oil companies to contribute in view of the letters which have been sent to them from church leaders in britain america france and the netherlands by way of compensation for the breach of sanctions during the illegal rgime <e>", "<cs> my lords we have to thank the noble baroness lady vickers for this naval <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my fellow journalist lady birk for this opportunity to speak because it was as a crime reporter that i became politically sensitised and largely because of this matter that we are discussing tonight <e> <s> there is no question whatever in my experience a fairly extensive one in this area that the identification of crime and of misery particularly misery with bad housing is a paramount problem of our society <e> <s> it is something which still remains with us although i thought that over the years we were doing something substantial about it <e>", "<cs> i should have thought that the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran with all his knowledge would know that he is probably not immune from this tapping <e> <s> if he deals in intellectual property then he is one of the people most likely to be exposed to industrial espionage <e> <s> i assure my noble and learned friends lord gardiner and lord elwyn-jones that they would no longer be able to go out in their car and talk to each other with immunity because we now have telescopic bugs which pick up from a distance <e> <s> we are in a most extraordinary situation where practically anybody at any time unless we provide safeguards will be able to bug anybody else <e>"]
