["<cs> my lords courtesy demands that a member of the house of bishops who is a member of your lordships house should convey some views on the present business before the house and i am grateful that my first words should he spoken under such an obligation of courtesy <e>", "<cs> my lords reference has been made to the differences between the majority and minority recommendations which were contained in that very comprehensive report <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak as someone much of whose life has been spent professionally in education at different levels and significantly at the higher education level and as someone whose work as a bishop for years has not only put him in the chair of diocesan education committees but brings him also into constant touch with universities and places of higher education <e> <s> i speak with an awareness of the governments hope as expressed in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise for speaking a second time from these benches in one afternoon <e> <s> i wish to make one point clear at the start <e> <s> i rise to express unease about this brief but very significant proposed amendment to the suicide act <e> <s> it is an unease which i feel very deeply myself and which i have good reason to believe would be felt by my own fellow churchmen <e> <s> but let me say at once that i am conscious that the motive from which the bill springs is that which is incorporated in the wording of the noble lords bill itself in the word compassion <e> <s> we are invited to acknowledge the compassionate concern that might prompt someone to help a fellow human being to find their way out of the pain and grief of life as it has become for them by ending it themselves <e> <s> put in those terms who would focus the issue more quickly for us than the doctor faced with such a plea from his patient <e> <s> my point i hope that i am not misunderstanding the matter is that surely we cannot form a mind on this proposed amendment to the law without taking account of the whole of that complex and subtle moral question euthanasia <e> <s> i could foresee great concern not only in the medical profession but also among churchmen at the passing of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may speak very briefly to the amendments just proposed <e> <s> as a bishop who has followed the progress of the bill of the noble lord lord meston with close and sympathetic interest may i say that as i understand it the bishops would hope to see the bill proceed whether or not amended in this particular <e> <s> it is recognised that this amendment is designed to give a measure of protection to the young in the face of possible <e>", "<cs> the noble lord who spoke to this amendment referred in presenting it to clauses and <e> <s> i hope that on the other hand there might be a mention by the noble earl lord swinton of considering how far the proposed amendment would affect the matter of aided and special agreement schools in clause which sets out the ordering of curricula in those schools in terms which are significantly different it seems to me from what is proposed in the amendment <e>", "<cs> with the assurances given by the noble earl which i am very grateful to receive <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble earl the minister for his clarification of where control lies and of conduct <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i appreciate and support the government in saying that it is unacceptable to subject a pupil to a continued temporary exclusion which is the point of the amendment <e> <s> my colleagues on the general synod board of education and the catholic education council have been concerned about the position of the governors of aided schools if the local authority is to be given the power to give directions to the head teacher in the way proposed in the bill <e> <s> the head teacher of an aided school is after all the employee of the governors and governors of an aided school have traditionally been responsible for admissions to and by extension exclusions from their schools <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that assurance <e> <s> i was anxious to secure the possibility of that consideration <e> <s> i accept that understanding <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl for his assurances on that point and i am glad to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for the very careful response of the noble earl and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am more than grateful for the respect with which the noble earl has regarded the amendment and for the offer he has made to look at this question <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister able to tell us of any help being given by government to family centres and neighbourhood groups which offer informal support to families <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord sudeley for the opportunity his question provides of offering to your lordships house an assurance <e> <s> in using that word i am conscious at this moment of the cautions that were expressed by the noble lord lord beaumont and the noble marquess lord salisbury on the hazards of the temptation to offer assurances <e> <s> but the assurance i offer is from a position of particular responsibility towards my brother bishops which i presently carry <e> <s> i chair the committee of the house of bishops which manages the inspections of the english theological colleges and courses to which reference has been made this evening the difference between a college and a course being that a college offers residential training <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with great respect to the noble baroness and to the noble viscount who spoke from such informed concern and i look forward to having my understanding further increased by the speeches of other noble lords this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking from these benches and for noble lords on the cross-benches i take it as the greatest of privileges to remember someone who was a friend someone from whose hands i received my own consecration as a bishop and someone who always conveyed that great sense that things mattered to god <e> <s> because of his experience in the union of the university of cambridge of which he was once president michael ramsey might have been moved to enter the world of political engagement <e> <s> instead he served the ordained ministry of the church of god but always with the consciousness that it is in the civil order and the actualities of daily life that christian decisions must be made <e> <s> he always had respect for those carrying responsibility in the civil order <e> <s> therefore as noble lords have heard in the tributes which have been given in your lordships house he was loved and respected not only by his fellow churchmen and those of other churches but not least by members of your lordships house <e> <s> he held his membership of this house in most serious regard <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the opportunity provided me by this short debate which we owe to the noble lord lord chalfont <e> <s> i put my name down to speak in order to say one thing in respect of a single area of the bbcs responsibilities under the royal charter religious broadcasting <e> <s> i hope that my brief intervention will not seem irrelevant to the very specific question that the noble lord is raising <e>", "<cs> as visitor of three cambridge colleges i should like to speak a word in support of what my brother has said concerning his relationship with the oxford colleges <e>"]
