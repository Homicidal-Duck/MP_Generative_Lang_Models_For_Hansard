["<cs> my lords it is at least a comfort to know that whatever acrimony there may be and for those who come from another place lack of acrimony is already one of the more comforting features of this establishment all your lordships will recognise the feeling of apprehension with which any new peer speaks here for the first time <e> <s> indeed it is a sense of apprehension which i think is equalled only at that point where one finally decides the particular debate in which to intervene <e> <s> i chose todays debate with considerable trepidation <e> <s> as i look around your lordships house there are so very many familiar faces <e> <s> many of them have managed to retain a degree of elegant slimness which has escaped me <e> <s> but none the less they represent elements in my political past many old friends politicians and civil servants eminent economists people who over the years have played a major part in making this country what it is today <e>", "<cs> my lords the motion of the noble lord lord beswick for which all of us are grateful places some stress on the need to achieve a consensus <e> <s> if i may say so at the risk of sounding impertinent as a new member in this house i am impressed with the speed with which the house has reacted to such an appeal <e> <s> it is clear that on all sides there is no one in favour of unemployment <e> <s> that does not surprise me because having had some experience of both houses of parliament i have never found anyone in british politics who was in favour of unemployment <e> <s> however at least having reached that degree of consensus it now means that we accept with it that there is not a greater degree of moral rectitude and compassion on one side of the house than there is on the other that the problems we face are the problems which concern and worry all of us <e> <s> as has been stressed everyone is concerned and there has been a consensus about the state of the british economy <e> <s> that does not surprise me either because in every debate that i have heard over the last to years politicians of all parties have been expressing concern about the state of the british economy <e>", "<cs> my lords that is exactly why you cannot plan it like that <e> <s> complex organisations have to react to outside events and there is very little convincing evidence to anyone who takes a dispassionate look at the british economy that attempts to manage it in detail what i believe the treasury mandarins describe in their wilder moments as the fine tuning of the economy under either party have been a conspicuous success <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with interest to the last comment of the noble lord about the possibility of meeting at least part of the problem by selling off parts of london transport to private enterprise <e> <s> if he identifies buyers i hope he will let me have prior notice <e> <s> i shall then proceed to sell them the pigeons in trafalgar square <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a great pleasure to follow the noble lord lord underhill who as he says has a reputation and justifiably so as a moderate man <e> <s> that is what concerns me very much from some <e>", "<cs> my lords i will come to that because that is basically what we are debating this afternoon and i had therefore intended to deal with it <e> <s> the bill makes changes <e> <s> it would be difficult to produce a bill before parliament that did not make changes <e> <s> what i am questioning is whether it represents a threat to the genuine justifiable rights of a free trade union in a free society <e> <s> the definition of the rights which need to be protected of the trade union movement have been defined clearly and concisely by the general secretary of the tuc mr len murray <e> <s> i quote <e>", "<cs> i must apologise to the committee for having been somewhat late on this occasion <e> <s> i think it is a combination of my past with british rail and experience of another place where things move at a more leisurely pace <e> <s> i listened to the noble lord lord campbell obviously with very great interest and consideration for the views which he puts forward <e> <s> but with the greatest respect i suggest that he misses the entire point of the new clauses <e> <s> this is not a question of a legal argument it is a question of practicality <e> <s> these two amendments are designed to assist an employer whose business is disrupted either in the case of amendment no <e> <s> by some of his own employees or in the case of amendment no <e> <s> by employees of some other business on which he is dependent <e> <s> this is intended to provide him with a third course of action <e> <s> as things stand in the present situation he has only two options open to him <e> <s> in such a situation he can meet the claim whatever its justification and however fair or unreasonable or he can continue to pay the full costs of the labour until such time as he goes insolvent <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for making those remarks and the context in which he made them <e> <s> in the light of them and the assurance that he has given it would be totally unreasonable even unforgivable to take any steps which would force him and the noble lord lord wedderburn into the same lobby <e>", "<cs> my lords it is interesting that the noble lord lord oram in referring to the amendment relied heavily on the donovan report <e> <s> this is significant because the donovan report must be something like years out of date <e> <s> this is the significance of this debate <e> <s> a great deal has happened in the past years <e> <s> we have seen disputes called over and over again which on all the evidence were unrepresentative <e> <s> on a number of occasions employers have appealed over the heads of the union leadership to the rank and file and the rank and file have taken a view totally at odds with that of the union leadership <e> <s> that was not a position which donovan was looking at or years ago <e> <s> this is something new and recent <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> did it ever occur to him at all to sell the shares <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that when i first heard comments being made in relation to this particular bill my heart began to beat faster <e> <s> i heard it described as a massive and vicious attack upon the greater london council and there are many less worthy causes than that <e> <s> i was led to suppose from speeches which i have read that mr livingstone for example took strong exception to it <e> <s> generally as a rule of thumb i find that mr livingstones perturbation is to me a source of pleasure satisfaction and confidence <e> <s> having listened to the two speeches which oppose the bill so far i remain as puzzled as i was at the beginning <e> <s> this is a very gentle little bill <e> <s> it is not a bad bill it does not do any particular harm <e> <s> it does not do very much for those major problems in public transport particularly in some of the large conurbations and particularly for those of us who live in london <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down could he possibly answer the question that i raised <e> <s> i want the taxpayer to get value from the report <e> <s> could he tell us how much the taxpayer has paid for the report <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble lord tell us whether we should have to pay another for that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am conscious of the lateness of the hour and i shall be brief <e> <s> i should like <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that as a result of an absence of a few minutes i missed the speech of the right reverend prelate who i gather made references to the government proposals in respect of trade union reform <e> <s> i gather that he was less than enthusiastic about some aspects of that matter <e> <s> however i was cheered by the noble viscount who has just sat down because i find my own views very much in common with his <e> <s> the present protected and uniquely privileged position of the trade unions today is completely outdated and is in many cases the basis both of a completely irresponsible misuse of a unique power and of privilege which is available to no one else <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me to intervene this is called learning from experience <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree on reflection that it is impossible to keep politics out of this particular dispute which has long since ceased to be an industrial dispute and is clearly being conducted in its implications as a direct challenge to the courts and parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord will give way <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole house will be grateful to the noble lord lord harris of greenwich for raising this subject on this particular occasion <e> <s> i find it rather worrying in many ways that we are debating it on a rather one-sided basis <e> <s> many noble lords are rising to condemn what has been happening and many are expressing concern but in terms of participation from the opposition benches this has been one of the most unbalanced debates that i have ever experienced in this house <e> <s> it is somewhat strange <e>", "<cs> no no <e> <s> i am speaking in very general terms <e> <s> there are noble lords who preside over tribunals concerned with industrial relations problems and yet in relation to this particular problem not a word is said <e> <s> the reason that not a word is said i believe is that many people on both sides of this house and of another place recognise that this is <e>", "<cs> i intervene very briefly because frankly i am puzzled by the noble lords amendment <e> <s> it seems to me that the bill as printed makes it very clear that <e>", "<cs> i apologise i have no intention of turning this into a duologue <e> <s> but the fact that parliament in its wisdom inserted unnecessary words and provisions in past legislation is no reason for those of us who were not here at the time and who can plead not guilty to doing so to say that they must be continued in the future <e> <s> i realise that we cannot speak on amendment no <e> <s> but i find it very strange that it should be suggested by people who say that we cannot have any persons working for an advertising agency or a manufacturer or supplier of equipment that it is absolutely essential that there should be somebody on the board who comes from the entertainment industry <e>", "<cs> at the risk of sounding negative i should like to follow the noble lord in his objection to this amendment on the principle of being strongly opposed to setting up boards and authorities which are comprised of individuals all representing a specific sectional interest <e> <s> it is an increasing trend with regionalisation in a country whose prime fear seems to be the ungovernability of its land mass that we must have somebody representing the welsh somebody the scots somebody the irish we do not normally have somebody representing the english or londoners who are a large part of the population and somebody representing this or that group <e> <s> if the intention of the amendment is to ensure that the views of the staff are properly reflected that seems to me to be perfectly right and proper <e> <s> but it is something which will happen within each company separately where there is a specific structure to deal with that <e>", "<cs> having opposed on principle the idea of having labelled seats on the authority and that is a principle about which i feel very strongly i find this amendment even easier to oppose and i am troubled by it <e> <s> frankly if there is one interest group that does not need to be protected in this particular case it is that of the consumer <e> <s> that the consumer needs protection is an extraordinary proposition <e> <s> the consumer is the paymaster <e> <s> i sit as chairman of a commercial television company <e> <s> i promise your lordships and i make no virtue out of it because it is pure self-interest that i think of nothing else but the consumer <e> <s> i wake every day hoping that more consumers will be happier with the product <e>", "<cs> what worries a number of us is that there is no kind of financial discipline on the authority <e> <s> if it collects more money than it needs that money is to be taken from it <e> <s> but the capacity of bodies of this kind to spend money is almost limitless <e> <s> if the authority is to have what appears to be a complete blank cheque to make whatever kind of demands it can justify by reason of the fact that it is able to spend that money that will be very dangerous indeed <e> <s> i join those noble lords who say that the suggestion made by the noble lord lord mishcon about some kind of right of appeal and challenge would be fair and helpful <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down my point is very simple <e> <s> my fear is not that the authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with others in congratulating the noble lord lord bottomley <e> <s> we have known each other now for a time in excess of years indeed after my election to another place in october on the day i left my office the noble lord lord bottomley returned to the national union of public employees took over my secretary my car and my office <e> <s> since those days the national union of public employees has changed a great deal <e> <s> we found it possible to do a solid job of work without some of the actions which have characterised it in recent years <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to interrupt the coming together as it were of all sides of the committee on this amendment but i find the amendment very easy to oppose and to oppose totally <e> <s> on originally reading the amendment i felt that it was easy to draw attention to the fact that as drafted and we well understand the problems a party in opposition has in drafting an amendment at first sight it seemed to enable some of the bad practices which have been castigated by all sides to continue for example to exclude expenditure on information and advice services <e> <s> a great deal of money is wasted on what are called information and advice services which are frequently party political broadsheets produced at the taxpayers expense <e> <s> that would not be so bad if it was confined to the taxpayers who support the party concerned <e> <s> the noble lord lord ennals clarified the argument <e> <s> it is not about that kind of expenditure at all <e> <s> therefore i make no attempt to argue about the drafting of the amendment <e>", "<cs> i totally take the point that the noble lord makes about the valuable work done by a lot of the advice bureaux but will he address himself to the point that i was trying to make <e> <s> it was not opposed to those services but how can one justify a situation where there are cut-backs in national expenditure on the social services but at the same time unlimited social expenditure through local authorities <e> <s> that seems a palpable absurdity <e>", "<cs> my lords the degree of unanimity on this amendment is so unusual and so total that it is with great trepidation that i even ask the minister questions <e> <s> i clearly misunderstood the amendment in terms in the same way that the amendment of the <e>", "<cs> my lords if i might say so to the noble baroness i am grateful for her concern but after the first years or so one gets used to it <e>", "<cs> this is a very special night <e> <s> that is demonstrated by the number of noble lords attending the debate at this late hour <e> <s> i shall seek to be as brief as possible <e> <s> it is special because this is a very unusual situation <e> <s> tonight the government will be going through the not-content lobby arm in arm with the labour members of the opposition <e> <s> one could almost stop there and say that there must be something wrong with the governments position <e> <s> as a result they will almost certainly of course defeat the amendment <e> <s> they have very efficient whips <e> <s> the amendment i suspect is gone <e>", "<cs> my noble friends should not push the line too far <e> <s> i am sorry i should say that noble lords on the labour benches should not push the line too far <e> <s> i have been as they will know a full-time union official for nine years <e>", "<cs> i played an active role in the labour party when the noble lord lord underhill was its very successful leading <e>", "<cs> i do not want to digress and i was hoping not to be controversial in this <e> <s> if i may say so the noble lord lord underhill has the credit for being the person who exposed the ballot rigging and the manipulation involving militant tendency within the labour party <e> <s> he was responsible for that and it was a very honourable achievement and a very important one so far as this country is concerned <e> <s> he knows far more about it than i do <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a rare occasion for me because the arguments of the noble lord lord mccarthy are certainly arguments that i could not take issue with <e> <s> the noble lord made a devastating attack upon the government <e> <s> there is great truth in what he says <e> <s> the burden of his case which cannot be challenged by the government is that many of the arguments that have been placed in support of these amemdments are very different from the case that the government made on previous occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the very real problems of membership of this house as i have discovered is that so many of its members have worked together so closely in the past that they share the experiences of each other <e> <s> i am bound to say that when i listened to the noble lord lord diamond with whom i worked as a colleague and from whom i learned a great deal i had to remind myself that we had sat in the same government around the same cabinet table <e> <s> there certainly seemed to me to be no recollection by the noble lord of the economic horrors through which we lived during that period the dashed hopes and dreams the realisation of the limitations of governmental power faced with a hostile international economic situation <e> <s> those aspects were certainly borne in on me <e>", "<cs> certainly i am grateful for the compliment <e> <s> one of the reasons in my mind was not the change i shall come to that in a moment in political power and direction within the labour party as applied to some people subsequently after failing to be elected to the national executive of the labour party <e> <s> the main reason why i moved across was because that period proved to me that the measures upon which the entire socialist approach to economic matters was based did not work <e> <s> i remember th march when we looked over the edge and saw how close we were to total economic collapse at that period and how grateful we were that the international monetary fund like the eleventh united states cavalry in a bad b feature movie came to our rescue and forced us to do things that we were longing to do but which politically we were unable to do <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me <e>", "<cs> i think that the problem with this clause and with some of the following clauses is not that it is in need of looking at again and reconsidering in many cases it is fundamentally wrong in its aims <e> <s> i certainly hope that the committee will see fit to support amendment no <e> <s> although amendment no <e> <s> moved by the noble lord lord bruce of donington would also be an improvement <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord does so on the point concerning the serving of a notice on fellow directors does he not believe that in those circumstances the director concerned would have no alternative but to resign immediately and that the company would in reality find itself in liquidation forthwith as a result of that <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to interrupt the noble lord and i am grateful to him <e> <s> that is a misunderstanding <e> <s> it was certainly not my suggestion that if a company was in serious difficulties you should call all the creditors together and ask what to do next <e> <s> i think that would be self-fulfilling very rapidly <e>", "<cs> one should never be churlish when governments return bearing gifts and wherever possible i think they should be encouraged since it shows they are movng in the right direction <e> <s> i am bound to say that i have never understood the logic of the preferred status of the crown in the case of an insolvency because i cannot see the distinction between someone who is using goods and services which rightly belong to other persons and someone who is using for his own purposes cash whether it be cash owed to the state or cash owed to some other person <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl whether he agrees that while no one in the house would want to see the present situation followed by any attitude of vindictiveness to those people who have been out on strike in this long sad and stupid dispute one is entitled to ask the government for an unqualified undertaking that those very brave men who have braved organised thuggery on an unprecedented scale for the past year will also be entitled to the protection of the coal board and the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i should declare a direct financial interest in a commercial station <e> <s> will the noble lord the minister be kind enough to again address himself to the point raised by the noble lord lord aylestone <e> <s> leaving aside whatever decision is finally reached the commercial sector is comprised of companies dependent upon private investors <e> <s> there is a finite amount of advertising revenue available and to place commercial companies in that sort of level of uncertainty for a period of years is extremely dangerous for the companies concerned and for the thousands of employees who work within those companies <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure for me to follow the noble lord lord bottomley <e> <s> in when i was elected to another place he and i were both members and officials of the same trade union <e> <s> when i left to enter the other place he inherited my office my car and my secretary <e> <s> at that time i not only viewed him then as now with affection but i also agreed with most of what he said <e> <s> one of us has changed and i do not think it is him but i disagree with a great deal of what he has said today <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness whether she has taken into account the effect that these changes will have on companies which suddenly find themselves faced with an annual increase in their wage costs their labour costs of anything up to million or million a year <e> <s> on some large companies this will have virtually no effect while on others there will be vast effects <e>", "<cs> listening to the amendments and the discussion on this bill it seems to me the most unbelievably bad bill in its effect that one has ever encountered <e> <s> whatever view one takes in terms of for or against corporal punishment since parliament has decided to go down this particular path it seems to me that we are in danger of making the position of teachers almost impossible <e> <s> as i understand the amendment it places a teacher in a situation where if he or she in a moment of anger with a particularly irritating child and all parents know that all children are at times particularly irritating slaps it across the leg and it happens to be the child of an over-protective parent the teacher then finds himself or herself faced with criminal proceedings <e> <s> that seems to me to be absurd in the extreme <e> <s> if the teacher uses excessive force on the child then quite rightly as with any other person that teacher is open to criminal proceedings as i understand it <e> <s> but to place a teacher in a situation where for slapping a child across the back of the legs in a matter of irritation or of the moment automatically he or she is subject to criminal proceedings is an absurdity and i would have thought the bill contains enough absurdity not to increase the quantity <e>", "<cs> i should like to follow that point if i may because many of the contributions that we have had on this subject have contained emotive words such as beating and flogging <e> <s> quite frankly any teacher who beats a child who is under five in any accepted way should certainly be fired and probably prosecuted and i suspect that he would be found guilty under the law <e> <s> if corporal punishment is a question of smacking children probably sometimes in their own interests and we are really getting to the level of saying that that must not even be allowed then i think it is an absurdity <e> <s> one of the problems is that people are defining corporal punishment in the way most of us tend to think of it and as i understand it that is not the way it is defined in the bill <e> <s> i repeat the point that with some children some rather tougher punishment has an effect but i think anyone who is <e>", "<cs> i find this such an extraordinary bill that it is difficult to develop a particular theme with it <e> <s> i find that i have a great deal of sympathy with the amendment for two reasons <e> <s> first i think it quite wrong that a teacher may be placed in a position where he is expected by his employers to administer physical force to people who are bigger than he is <e> <s> i come from the state system and on the whole i have never been in favour of hitting people who are as big as i am or even bigger only people who are much smaller <e> <s> therefore on a quite serious point i think it is asking too much that that be expected of the teacher if that is the tradition of the school <e>", "<cs> i shall speak very briefly because i wish to make only three specific points <e> <s> when the noble lord lord shepherd opened his remarks he said that there was nothing particularly evil about cross-subsidisation in this area <e> <s> he then went on as i think he was bound to do with his experience constantly to refer back to many of the real dangers of cross-subsidisation about which in his own view he has always been very clear <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble viscount agree that leaks and squabbles between ambitious ministers are commonplace and that the only thing if we use the term somewhat loosely which distinguishes this particular episode is the maverick behaviour of some of the participants which cannot be defended by anyone <e> <s> but would not the noble viscount also agree that there is now a danger that this whole episode is becoming totally out of proportion to the level of near-farce <e> <s> will he not confirm that many people and one hopes that the government would agree believe that there are other things to which the government should be directing their energies at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister not agree that if a significant shareholding in westland had been held by the staff of westland whose judgment has been consistently superior to that of many other people involved in this particular saga this fiasco might have been avoided <e> <s> in the light of this experience will he not further agree that in the case of another defence contractor shortly to be privatised and i declare an interest every encouragement should be given to the employees of vickers shipbuilding who want the opportunity to invest their own money in the company for which they work and who will therefore presumably take a commercial view a view which was frequently absent from some of the strictures in the last saga <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord give the house some indication of how much public money has been placed in british leyland so far in an unsuccessful effort to keep it independent <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a gross slur on the integrity of ministers and ex-ministers to suggest that regardless of party they leak confidential information when it is well known that they have always confined themselves to confidential and helpful background briefing <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness not agree that her answer was wide of the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords a number of people have said that this house has debated these subjects and indeed they have been debated in the country as a whole on many occasions <e> <s> i think that is a good thing and the house is indebted to the noble lord lord bruce of donington for giving us the opportunity to raise this topic yet again because i think that there is a deep and fundamental difference of opinion which in serious debate cuts right the way through the political parties as the noble lords lord houghton of sowerby and lord aldington have said <e> <s> it is a strong and very serious argument about the future of this country and its method of administration <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that i do not believe that it ever will work <e> <s> i believe that you have a choice between a gosplan-type society where the state controls all elements of society or you have a free market society with government stepping in to control the excesses <e> <s> you cannot have a free society and a totally planned economy at the same time <e> <s> it is the mistake that has been made over and over again <e> <s> yet years after we still raise this as an alternative <e> <s> what worries me because i obviously take a different view is that it commands support right across the spectrum <e> <s> the noble lord lord aldington and his committee were attracted to some extent <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that <e> <s> i apologise for misrepresenting the noble lord as obviously i did <e> <s> we should bear in mind that the fact that governments say that they have a strategy does not lead one necessarily to accept that there is truth in the statement <e> <s> the fact is that whenever governments embark upon a search for strategies they always find themselves moving gently ever so gently from strategy planning policies and suggestions to direct intervention <e> <s> no minister offered the opportunity can resist it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the tragedy and the point to be borne in mind is that there has been no lack of goodwill or sincerity in any of the parties when they have been dealing with these issues <e> <s> if there had been it would be easier to understand why the policies failed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i made the position clear <e> <s> i was not suggesting that it was comparable to gosplan <e> <s> i was saying that either you have a gosplan economy or a free economy <e> <s> you cannot have the middle road that the noble lord suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl not agree that the contraction of british rail engineering has been taking place over the last years under different governments and that the reason for this represents one of the basic problems of british manufacturing industry <e> <s> most of the british rail engineering workshops are well over years old are totally uneconomic and are designed for vehicles which bear no relationship to those which are manufactured today <e> <s> indeed had we been able to modernise and rationalise those workshops many years ago more people might have been earning more money as a result of their production today <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that many of us who have the good fortune to be british telecom shareholders would be very grateful if he would keep his representations to the absolute minimum other than possibly pointing out the fact that we would all agree with any attempt it may make to keep a sharp eye on the odd million that may be around <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may follow that point <e> <s> i am chairman of a fairly large charity <e> <s> there are people associated with companies who provide professional services for that charity <e> <s> because of the relationships which have grown up between the professional companies concerned and the charity there are persons who are employees or partners in those professional companies who give their advice free of charge <e> <s> i am slightly bewildered <e> <s> i do not know whether the bill covers people whose remuneration is undoubtedly derived from a company which is providing a financial service for professional fees but who are not in receipt of fees in relation to the advice that they give the charity <e>", "<cs> i read this amendment with interest and i think everyone will sympathise with the motives behind it <e> <s> i mentioned earlier that i am chairman of the trustees of a fund which for historical reasons because it is a very old hospital is per cent <e> <s> invested in property <e> <s> it is invested in small villages like watford of which it has owned large chunks for several hundred years <e>", "<cs> my lords as a general point and given the noble viscounts wide experience in the area will he recognise that most members of your lordships house are not paid at all but that expense allowances which far exceed salaries would be totally unacceptable anywhere outside the palace of westminster <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make the point that i recognise totally that members of your lordships house do an enormous amount of work totally free except for expenses <e> <s> i am simply asking whether if <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my thanks to the noble lord lord harris for introducing the debate <e> <s> it is an extremely important and very clear issue <e> <s> in a short debate we cannot conceivably discuss the complexities of the various different solutions that may be suggested <e> <s> what we are faced with is a clear difference of principle <e> <s> the noble lord lord stallard stated his partys policy clearly and with total sincerity <e> <s> there is no compromise with the principles behind the policy as i think he would agree <e> <s> we are actually talking of a fundamental difference of approach <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether the noble lord will want to answer my question <e> <s> does he agree that competition in this particular area is international rather than national <e> <s> does he agree that these are two independent commercial private companies that the merger would appear to many outside observers to make commercial sense and that it is certainly good for the british airline industry <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the original question and the supplementary questions are only examples of a whole range of areas where the national health service is demonstrably unable in its present form to cope with the growing problems which face it <e> <s> is there not now a case for a complete and fundamental re-think of the whole national health service going back to first principles and ignoring the herds of sacred cows that roam around it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that the transfer of the management of british rail to this house might not be an unlimited blessing <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a very real honour and a very considerable pleasure to have the opportunity of following the noble lord and to congratulate him upon his speech which was as robust as we would all have expected it to be <e> <s> i think it is possible that not every word and every view which he expressed was shared totally by everyone in the chamber <e> <s> i believe i can take the liberty of saying on behalf of all noble lords present that should be at any time decide to campaign for the presidency of the national union of mineworkers he will receive enthusiastic unqualified all-party support <e> <s> we look forward to hearing from the noble lord in times to come <e>", "<cs> it is with some trepidation that i start by disagreeing with the noble and learned lord lord hailsham of saint marylebone and agreeing with the noble baroness lady faithfull and the noble lord lord barnett on the question of the constitutional position <e> <s> this is not because i understand the constitutional position but because normally i agree that this chamber should not see itself as a court of appeal for decisions of the commons <e> <s> i believe that the doctrine of the commons right or wrong is no more acceptable than the concept of my government right or wrong <e> <s> if members of the committee feel that the commons has produced something so important and fundamentally flawed that they cannot accept it i think that they have no alternative but to seek to reject it <e> <s> if that were to mean that it brought into question the future of this house so be it <e> <s> in my view it is wrong and as i hope to say unnecessary to argue against the proposition on the basis of a technicality <e> <s> i believe i say this without any disrespect to the noble lord lord chelwood that the amendment is fundamentally flawed based on a series of false premises and totally without merit <e>", "<cs> with respect i do not wish to be led too far astray <e> <s> there are properties within the city of westminster that over the last eight to years have quadrupled in value <e> <s> that would lead one to assume that whatever the new rate set as a result those people will be paying a higher rate relative to others <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that in this matter we are far more vulnerable in london than the japanese are in tokyo <e> <s> does he also agree that to take sanctions against two of the worlds biggest financial houses on an issue of this kind hardly increases confidence in london as a european financial centre <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that whether or not his right honourable colleague referred to tax relief in private health insurance it is still a good idea <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> can he give some indication of the basic problem <e> <s> as the noble lord lord williams has said there is nothing very unusual about articles of association which are normally drawn up quite quickly although these will be much more complicated <e> <s> many of us on all sides of the chamber are bewildered as to what kind of problem is causing the delay <e>", "<cs> the debate demonstrates the importance of the amendment <e> <s> these are very big issues indeed <e> <s> i declare my own position very clearly <e> <s> i suspect that my interest in the articles of association would run diametrically opposed to that of many noble lords on the opposition benches but we cannot discuss the matter <e> <s> i would very much regret it if the articles of association were so restrictive as to place additional impediments upon the corporation <e> <s> people begin to express shock and horror at the prospect of foreign directors sitting on the board of the british steel corporation but i think that it would be highly beneficial in that international industry <e> <s> i sit on the boards of companies in hong kong canada the united states and france <e> <s> i think that it is useful <e> <s> it is the modern world <e> <s> however there is a little englander view <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to inject a somewhat disharmonious note into the proceedings <e> <s> nonetheless i should like to express the view that if the amendment were carried one would virtually have to give the industry away if one wanted anyone to underwrite it <e> <s> indeed i think that a factory in the centre of the sahara desert selling central heating would be a far better bet than the bill would be with this particular amendment in it <e>", "<cs> the noble lord introduced me into his speech <e> <s> can he name me one company which has anything approaching this type of amendment in its articles of association <e> <s> of course companies including nationalised industries as good citizens have an obligation to behave responsibly and socially <e> <s> i suggest that there are no companies and that he has no evidence of any which would take on board the commitment to maintain massive loss-making undertakings for social reasons <e> <s> they could not survive if they did <e>", "<cs> the answer to the noble lord lord williams is that this only goes to show how careful one has to be in educating the public before people start investing <e>", "<cs> my lords anyone who has been a junior minister must have a great deal of sympathy with the noble earl <e> <s> junior ministers i have been one myself are occasionally landed with some nonsense that their masters dream up and have no choice but to read it with a straight face <e> <s> i have every sympathy with the noble earl <e> <s> in some years experience around the building i have never encountered anything sillier than this measure <e> <s> it is based on a doctrinaire nonsense <e> <s> the assumption in the bill as a whole that people will suddenly take a passionate interest in local government because the basis of their local taxation has changed is a nonsense <e> <s> to suggest that the halls used over the christmas period for the purpose of crisis at christmas would in future be alive with animated discussion about local government and which councillors they will vote for in the next round of elections is i think open to argument and some disbelief <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for giving way <e> <s> the noble earl mentioned these very small amounts that would be levied he mentioned for example a figure of p <e> <s> can he tell the house what the administrative costs of dealing with those kinds of sums would be even as a proportion <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that anyone who has watched the nauseating examples of religious broadcasting in north america would hope very much that the government will stand firm against it <e>", "<cs> does the noble earl agree that it seems to be fairly obvious that the reason every modern army around the world has shifted from bolt-action rifles to self-loading rifles is precisely because they are more efficient vehicles for killing people <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking as one of the unsuccessful bidders will the minister accept that to the best of my knowledge none of the proposals for county hall suggests turning it into a hotel <e> <s> does he not accept that the proposals envisage that a hotel would be a part of a vastly more attractive development than exists in the whole of that area at the present time and would function more to the benefit of the citizens of london than the use that was made of county hall by its previous occupants <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that no one in the house will be at all surprised to find that no legal liability rests with the government in this respect <e> <s> the report which we have not had the opportunity to read is purely factual <e> <s> i ask the noble lord whether he agrees with this <e> <s> what is at issue here is the moral responsibility of the government who introduced and administered a licensing system which small investors quite understandably saw as a good housekeeping seal of approval <e> <s> however it failed to protect the investor and indeed virtually encouraged people to invest on a basis upon which they should never have done <e> <s> does the noble lord agree that it is not a question of sympathy nor of the law <e> <s> many people believe that the government and the taxpayer generally who is behind the government have a moral responsibility for this failure <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister agree that the problems of traffic and movement in london do not arise from the shortage of studies but from the fact that the division and control of transport in london between three authorities the police the department and the local authorities makes it impossible to look at the problems of london as a whole <e> <s> does not the minister think that the time is long overdue to study not simply the problem but the possibility of having a single authority for london transport <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that far from the german authorities not being aware of the proposed bid gec is to be congratulated on making the bid without which it is almost <e>", "<cs> would the minister be prepared to suggest to his noble friend the leader of the house that it would be reasonable for this house to have an opportunity to debate this unique situation at greater length <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government believe that there is a potential hazard involved in the present lack of regulation of hours does the noble viscount consider that a more important matter than awaiting the approval of the tuc and the shipowners <e> <s> is it not a matter for the public at large <e>", "<cs> my lords following from the question raised by the noble lord lord harris is it not clear that our present penal system is producing conditions which are indefensible in an advanced society <e> <s> is it not further clear that those problems are fundamental and that the time has now arrived when there is a need quite apart from this particular inquiry for a fundamental review of penal policy in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl not agree that as both parties have discovered when in government ultimately all exchange rates are determined by the market <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that there is some danger of the next general election campaign peaking too early <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that his answer indicated that the government would not be prepared to accept moneys offered if they were earmarked for a particular case <e> <s> is that not an example of the treasurys obsessive objection to any form of hypothecation carried to absurd limits when it could mean that the taxpayers are net losers <e>", "<cs> my objection to the amendment is that it assumes as political parties do that peoples political views are in neat little packages and that there is a labour party view a conservative party view or a liberal party view <e> <s> we all know that that is not the case <e> <s> anyone who has been in this building for very long knows that behind the facade views are held which would be complete anathema to other party supporters <e> <s> that situation applies to all sides of the house and it is particularly true in relation to these benches where there are noble lords who hold very strong political views on different issues <e> <s> those views are not right-wing or left-wing they vary <e>", "<cs> the noble lord asks a direct question <e> <s> the situation evens itself out in our system <e> <s> if one goes <e>", "<cs> i do not have a great deal of concern about the amendment as worded <e> <s> any intelligent employers faced with organised labour which is going to be the case in the television industry for the foreseeable future would be extremely stupid if they did not seek to reach agreement in the beginning <e> <s> if that is what the amendment means it does not mean anything because that is what people will do in any case <e> <s> as i think the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter was possibly hinting it will not be seen in that way at all <e>", "<cs> the problem here is that this is an almost unique situation where a comparatively large number of people will have british citizenship conferred upon them very quickly and speedily <e> <s> it is essential that it does happen very quickly and speedily <e> <s> as this is the first time i have spoken on the bill i should declare an interest in that i am chairman of a public company situated in hong kong the activities of which are concerned with direct and indirect investment in the peoples republic of china <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may ask him a question <e> <s> is it his view that if the amendment is accepted the individual circumstances of any one of those people could be subject to being raised in parliament <e> <s> if that were so i should certainly be opposed to it <e>", "<cs> the noble and gallant lord lord carver has raised a very important issue <e> <s> there undoubtedly are a number of cases which could be made in relation to this situation which are deeply moving <e> <s> in my submission they are not matters which should be dealt with in the bill <e> <s> one would hope the minister might be able to say that these matters would be looked at separately because i think it is very important that they should be <e> <s> this is a very caring chamber and it is not always popular to take issue <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> this is a crucial point <e> <s> i support the bill in its broad proposals but it is not based on fairness or principle <e> <s> it is based on a set of fairly arbitrary qualifications which will entitle people to passports paradoxically to stop them leaving the place <e> <s> that is not an issue of principle <e> <s> some people there will be frightened at the prospect of not being able to leave <e> <s> i understand that but i believe that if one seeks to impute ideas such as fairness to the bill one destroys its very objective <e> <s> that is not to say that one does not have great sympathy with some of the groups who will be at risk and who are unhappy <e> <s> but the bill is based on expediency to keep in hong kong people who will make it work <e> <s> there is no principle of fairness in that <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down and so that there will be no misunderstanding perhaps i may say that i disagree with no part of his interpretation of how he sees the bill <e> <s> of course it is designed to maintain morale in hong kong <e> <s> however it would be equally dangerous and cynical to give the impression that this bill which will provide much coveted passports to people who on the whole will be young highly successful men in good jobs is based on anything other than trying to maintain morale in hong kong <e> <s> if the noble lord regards that as a principle i can agree with him and would not argue with him about the semantics <e>", "<cs> it is possible to put a number of arguments against this amendment <e> <s> personally i shall be very interested to hear the arguments put forward by the government <e> <s> however the arguments against the amendment at the moment amaze me <e> <s> if this bill is successful the very people who will qualify for registration are those who are privileged now and will remain privileged certainly with the peoples republic of china because it is recognised that they are the people who will make things work <e>", "<cs> this chamber has to work on the assumption that the bill is a real contribution to stability in that area <e> <s> if one does not believe that it is pointless <e> <s> i come back to my basic point if one does not believe it one should look for an entirely different basis of selection <e> <s> in conclusion i believe that there are arguments which can be advanced against this amendment <e> <s> at the moment my thoughts are very ambivalent toward it <e> <s> however with great respect the argument that i have heard so far cannot be supported by logic <e>", "<cs> i do not want to get involved in a duel of words <e> <s> i make the assumption that the problem can be faced and that this solution can work <e> <s> if i did not believe that i think that one would be looking at something very different indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount consider that the government could take a more objective view of the problem and recognise the fact that mr arthur scargill has done far more to rationalise the industry than any government department or minister <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble lord believe that it would assist the house to consider more easily the constitutional implications which have been raised by carrying out an inquiry among former cabinet ministers in this house to see whether there are any who have not saved up juicy statements for party conferences <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the press council has not been a success over many years under many different chairmen <e> <s> does he also agree that its lack of success was at least in part due to its preoccupation with difficult matters of taste <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that british airways seems to have done much better since it ceased to have a steady stream of government advice <e>"]
