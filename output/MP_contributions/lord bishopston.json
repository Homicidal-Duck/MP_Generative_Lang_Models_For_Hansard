["<cs> my lords i too seek the indulgence of the house for a maiden speech <e> <s> i am not sure whether having entered your lordships house only a mere hours ago i should have left a respectably longer time before i ventured to address your lordships house <e> <s> but i suggest that one way in which i feel at home here is that i spent nearly years in the other place and i am pleased to be joining some of my former friends there on this occasion <e> <s> i note that i am to be followed by a right reverend prelate a lord bishop and this rather indicates to me that i was wise in seeking to avoid a title which would lead to my being mistaken for a lord spiritual a flattering prospect indeed <e> <s> yet i have managed to keep my name and also to associate myself with the city of my birth bristol or a part of it a part which was in the first constituency that i fought in bristol west nigh on years ago as well as having a territorial designation referring to newark the place where i live and where i was honoured to represent the people for about years <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister said on second reading this is an important and major piece of legislation for the british fishing industry and i am sure we are all pleased with the progress that has been made here and in the other place and which has now resulted in our considering the bill on third reading <e> <s> i noted at an earlier stage that the minister said that a culmination of events none of them connected with party politics created the position in which the industry had to go through a number of painful <e>", "<cs> my lords i will detain your lordships for only a few moments <e> <s> as one engaged in industry and with trade unions like many other noble lords here over the years i welcome the bill as a significant step forward in the reduction and indeed the prevention of industrial diseases <e> <s> it is not always realised of course just how much suffering and indeed death and grief are caused by the occupational environment and knowledge of the reasons for this situation and other factors concerning it is indeed essential if we are to reduce the causes of injury and death which often ensue <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first apologise for the unavoidable absence of my noble friend lady jeger who as noble lords will know has been concerned with this matter during earlier stages of the bill <e> <s> secondly i feel i should declare an interest as a member of the church commissioners who have some interest in the measure and also as a member of the council of the national trust <e> <s> i appreciate that the noble lord lord gibson has already made some observations <e> <s> i suppose my other local interest is that i live in nottinghamshire and therefore sherwood forest which is perhaps one of the best-known forests in the world is situated in the area where i live <e> <s> now being a country park it is one of the many amenities controlled by various authorities and which we appreciate and which is a cause of concern regarding this and other measure before the house <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add my concern to that already expressed <e> <s> the requirements of this moderate amendment are of great importance because the house has spent time looking at amendments and i heard the figure of or mentioned to the wildlife and countryside bill <e> <s> there is enormous interest in the country as noble lords will know about the preservation of wildlife whether animals or plants <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we welcome the amendment in that the present provision in the act says that land belonging to the national trust may be compulsorily purchased notwithstanding that it is held inalienably by the trust <e> <s> now of course the minister is giving protection to the trust so that its land will not be compulsorily purchased <e> <s> however may i ask him to say how this makes for any consistency when he is allowing national trust land leased to the forestry commission or at least the unplanted part of it to be disposed of <e> <s> it seems that in one case he is giving some protection and is saying what a good boy i am for so doing yet he will not protect the land which can be disposed of by the minister as he thinks fit <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may refer to the letter sent to the national trust a lot of discussion has gone on about it but of course the country does not know what we are talking about because we have not got the terms of the letter on record <e> <s> the letter of th may to the national trust regarding the assignment of leases from the national trust goes on to refer to mr wiggins letter of th april and says that that <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make a brief intervention <e> <s> it will of course be manifest that many of us have shown concern about the nature of this bill and rather late in the day the minister has said that he feels this amendment should be made whereby ministers shall have regard to the national interest in maintaining and expanding the forestry resources of great britain <e> <s> one welcomes that assurance after the impression we had about the nature of the measure <e> <s> of course these provisions are indeed welcome although we feel they do not go far enough <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether it is appropriate to say that i have been earmarked to speak in this matter only briefly of course because it is not a contentious matter <e> <s> there are two points i should like to raise <e> <s> would the minister say what consultations with the industry took place before the introduction of the order <e> <s> further the house will know that over many years successive governments have recognised that the only indelible and sure way of marking live sheep is by ear punching <e> <s> as the minister has said the sheep variable premium protection of payments no <e> <s> order which came into operation on th november required for live animals that the mark should be an ear punch <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may say a few words on this order <e> <s> i take it that we are speaking to the five orders together <e> <s> they all concern the vesting of areas of land in the merseyside development corporation land being transferred from the british railways board the mersey docks and harbour company and from local authorities <e> <s> though the subject is of a rather limited nature it gives the house an opportunity to discuss briefly the context in which they are being processed <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the minister of state for those remarks in introducing the order <e> <s> it is an important order which gives the house a brief opportunity to look at some of the problems facing the industry and the meat and livestock commission in its important work <e> <s> i am pleased that the minister of agriculture regards the mlc as an important body and that it has not suffered the fate of many quangos in being slaughtered if that is the appropriate term to use in this situation <e> <s> indeed the industry values its work for it provides a wide range of services for both the producer and the consumer and not only for the home market but for the international market as well <e>", "<cs> i said slaughtered <e>", "<cs> my lords in the brief time available may i make one or two comments and ask one or two questions <e> <s> the two very important conventions in these orders which we are discussing require international co-operation over the development and monitoring of facilities and natural resources <e> <s> in the case of the order relating to weather forecasts forecasts are of considerable economic and financial importance for they help agriculture construction shipping and other aspects which depend upon the weather <e> <s> turning to the order relating to the conservation of antarctic marine living resources it was agreed in that all possible steps should be taken to bring the convention into force as soon as possible so as to harvest the antarctic marine living resources and to co-operate broadly and comprehensively in their development <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> in my remarks which necessarily had to be condensed in view of the time available perhaps i should have said that we support the immunities and privileges granted by these two orders <e> <s> i am sure that the house is grateful for the brief progress report on the conventions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl the minister for the way in which he has introduced the orders and for the information which he has given the house <e> <s> he will not be surprised if i remind him and the house that when the previous lddc order last came before your lordships house on st july to which the minister has made reference my noble friend lady birk expressed some misgivings on it and notified the house of several aspects of concern not only to the opposition but to local authorities to the petitioners and others <e> <s> probably the main area <e>", "<cs> my lords as previous speakers have indicated i am sure your lordships are indebted to my noble friend lord cledwyn of penrhos to the members of the european communities select committee and to those who gave evidence for the report <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for the way in which he moved the second reading and for providing the background which i am sure will be most helpful in assisting us to get a perspective of events which led up to the need to bring forward this measure and which as he said replaces a proved system of nearly half a century the hoard having been formed in <e> <s> as we know the hops marketing board has been one of the number of boards and organisations which over the years have made a significant contribution to the prosperity of agriculture our most productive industry and the industry has benefited from the work of the boards chairman now the noble earl lord selborne the members of the board and all associated with it in the organisation of the hops industry <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down may i apologise to him for having put so many questions <e> <s> yet i am sure that the industry and the house will be grateful for the extra information which he has now given to us <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly join with others in paying tribute to my noble friend lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the minister for the information that he has provided in moving these four orders <e> <s> he said at the end of his speech that in many ways these are technical matters <e> <s> but they go beyond that they concern matters of principle with regard to our relationship with the community itself and the cap <e> <s> i am not sure that the house will appreciate the reasons for the orders being brought forward because there has been criticism from all sides in the industry and from the national farmers union about the possible effects <e> <s> with regard to the dairy sector the national farmers union say that they deeply regret the decision implemented by these orders of restrictions on capital grant aid for dairy farming <e> <s> the main aid will be limited to smaller dairy herds and to an amount which will not increase the herd size beyond cows for the agriculture and horticulture development schemes ahds and cows for national investment grants ahgs <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for giving way <e> <s> i am sure he will realise that if we are to overcome some of the problems of surpluses and high costs and many of the criticisms of the community itself we have to ensure that agriculture and food production take place in those areas where they are most efficient otherwise the growing concern and criticism of the community will continue <e>", "<cs> my lords having just finished in the previous debate as a spokesman on agriculture and horticulture and rural subjects i might have said that i was going to shake the rural mud off my boots to enter our capital city but as the noble earl has said the area with which we are concerned is one of great regeneration and i suspect that there may be just as much mud there as anywhere else <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships house will be grateful to the noble lord lord lyell for the way in which he has introduced this measure and for the detailed comments he has made in support of it <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down would he not accept that if his definition of instant coffee was put on every jar sold there would be grounds for further confusion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all grateful for the opportunity of hearing my noble friend lord mishcon who has just spoken from a particular interest also the comments made by the noble lord lord hooson and the noble lord lord nugent of guildford to which i may refer a little later and of course the noble lord lord somers the brief intervention of the noble lord <e> <s> lord donaldson of kingsbridge and the comments of my noble friend lord brockway <e>", "<cs> i was <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are grateful to the minister of state for his comments on the final stages of this bill <e> <s> as he said on second reading and again today the board has been in existence for half a century having been formed in <e> <s> although there have been criticisms of course of the fact that there have been a number of boards and quangos a criticism which i do not share the hops marketing board with the full backing of the hops industry and the brewing industry has made a notable contribution <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are grateful to the noble lord lord sandys for explaining the order in the way in which he has <e> <s> we welcome the help given in the order <e> <s> the noble lord said that the increase is indicative of the governments commitment to maintain the confidence of the hill livestock sector when there are constraints on public expenditure <e> <s> that may of course be true but the government should also recognise that the farming industry itself is facing government restraints in other directions which makes its task of increasing food production much more difficult unless of course it has adequate government support <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for the way in which he has introduced the order and the details that he has given <e> <s> as he says it is important because it provides the essential back-up of grants to enable marine fish farmers to qualify for aid under the feoga aid scheme for the inshore fishing industry <e> <s> we welcome this help but in view of the importance of the potential of the fish farming industry when other fishery prospects are far from satisfactory i should like to put one or two questions to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are grateful to the minister for his explanation of these two orders which i think he has rightly taken together <e> <s> as he has reminded us one is subject to an annual review and the other to a review at various periods and with the rate of inflation in recent years it might be desirable at some time perhaps in the future to review more frequently than every months <e> <s> anyway i think that he will be relieved to know that we support the orders but i should like to put one or two questions to the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that noble lords are indebted to the noble baroness lady trumpington for her explanation of the bill a measure which i would suggest is of great importance for its effect and which if passed would give as she says freedom to shops to open at such time as they think fit repealing as it would certain parts of the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the commendable result which is attributed to the balance of payments is got from an industry with only per cent <e> <s> of the working population and which has very high productivity records <e> <s> will he reflect that the help generosity and partnership which the government rightly show to agriculture if extended to other sectors public and private might produce similarly commendable results <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i thank the minister for the way in which he has presented the bill and for the information which he has given <e> <s> while it may appear fortuitous that the bill is before your lordships house today the events of the weekend have shown yet again the diversity and the many forms of such happenings <e> <s> the events over the years both here and abroad have been such as to give public confidence and assurance and are bound to warn potential offenders of the dwindling hopes of success if they attempt such outrages here in great britain or indeed elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord lord campbell of croy for having introduced this subject <e> <s> the royal commission as lie said has performed an important service in producing in the eighth report a very comprehensive report of over pages <e> <s> it is timely that we are considering the reports of the select committee on european communities and we are indebted to its chairman and members for their

of dirty oily slimy water has passed under our bridges since then <e> <s> in fact we are dealing with a problem of many decades but the sophistication of our shipping industry has made matters worse to some extent as time has gone by because our precautionary measures have not matched the pace of science <e>", "<cs> my lords i can see the case made by the noble lord lord renton for this amendment regarding lawful excuse <e> <s> i have studied the convention which this bill seeks to ratify <e> <s> it seems to excuse such acts of terrorism by allowing terrorists to plead lawful excuse <e> <s> that i think is not compatible or it seems to be not compatible with the convention <e> <s> if hostage-taking is permitted with lawful excuse it is difficult to know what case could be made by terrorists who could plead political and other circumstances or that they were acting with the authority of another government <e> <s> the convention lays down very clearly the circumstances or acts which constitute the offence <e> <s> it is hard to see the justification for the claim made by the minister when on second reading he said at col <e>", "<cs> my lords i raised a number of points on second reading which were not pursued at committee stage and i have given the noble lord the minister notice of one or two points on which it would be helpful to have clarification <e> <s> on second reading i raised several matters <e> <s> one of them was in regard to extradition <e> <s> clause refers to extradition procedures and i should like to ask the minister whether he is satisfied with the procedures and situations where no extradition arrangements exist between the united kingdom and other countries <e> <s> the noble lord the minister was kind enough to reply to me on a number of points raised in the debate but i note that in his letter to my noble friend he states <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the minister agree that this unsatisfactory situation is due partly to <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord clarify the position a little further <e> <s> an affirmative order has to be affirmed a negative order has to be prayed against anyway in order to be debated and possibly varied <e> <s> would the noble lord say a word or two about that aspect with regard to the prayer for annulment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his explanation <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the committee is grateful to the noble baroness for the way she has moved her amendment and for the detailed explanation she has given in justification of it <e> <s> so far as the amendment itself is concerned i believe she is right in saying that this is a tidying-up amendment <e> <s> i ought to say that while i speak for the opposition by the nature of this bill my noble friends will of course themselves consider the matters drawn to their attention and decide and vote accordingly <e> <s> from my own position of what is a new term of benevolent neutrality if there are divisions i may not be noticeable in the division lobby <e>", "<cs> i had considered raising those points on the clause stand part but by then a number of amendments would have been discussed and the noble baroness might have been at a disadvantage wondering whether some of the points i put had been taken into account <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down will she accept from me that i believe that her contribution and the ministers comments a few moments ago will be helpful to her and to the committee as background when we discuss other amendments <e>", "<cs> i speak briefly to say that i think the committee will welcome this change of view from one month at present in the bill <e> <s> i hope that it also affords more time for consultation with all those who may be affected by the subsequent changes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all grateful to the noble lord lord cullen of ash-bourne for having explained these draft orders in the way he has <e> <s> on a day when your lordships house has already undertaken the consideration of a great deal of business and when much still remains to be done there may be a temptation to let these orders go through on the nod but i rather feel that if the time was available this topic could be the subject of a major debate because it concerns the present and future position affecting the wool textile industry which as many noble lords will know has been greatly hit by circumstances to which in a moment i shall briefly make reference <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord mottistone for introducing the debate which covers the farm proposals and the guidelines for european agriculture <e> <s> it has been the habit tonight for noble lords to delcare their interests <e> <s> although my family has been associated with agriculture <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for scotching that rumour <e> <s> after a long debate noble lords have naturally touched on the main points of concern

refer to some of them which i think are of particular interest and merit <e> <s> the report rightly says <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can comment on the noble lords view in a moment <e> <s> the point is of course that we need some surpluses but there are excesses which are an abomination to the community policy itself <e>", "<cs> my lords while the ban has been widely welcomed will the minister say something about the consistency of his attitude to the ban on the slaughter of seals around our coasts having regard to what may be the conflicting claims of conservation on the one hand and the interests of the fishing industry on the other <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to seek some clarification from the noble baroness lady trumpington intended as always to help her elucidate some of the questions raised to her benefit or the benefit of others <e> <s> i think that the amendment is an important one since as the noble lord has said it seeks to amend the bill to take into account conscientious objection to working on certain days <e> <s> it also has important implications for christians jews and indeed those of other faiths and one might also have to take into account the sensitivities of ethnic minorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise the point being made there by the noble baroness but i am trying to be helpful to her by saying that some of us may have questions or doubts in our minds about some of the points she has raised and it may be helpful to her if she can make known her views on these particular matters <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he accept that he has given some replies to questions that i put to the noble baroness to which for reasons of order she could not reply <e> <s> we welcome some of the safeguards to which the noble lord drew our attention <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak at the end of a long and detailed debate on this important measure <e> <s> i am sure that we are indebted to the noble earl the minister for the way in which he introduced the measure and the explanation he gave <e> <s> i must admit and i am sure that other noble lords may agree with me that i was sorry that he did not set out the main provisions of the bill because he gave the reasons for the measure as being very pedestrian <e> <s> he said it was a major step forward in reducing the size of the public sector <e> <s> that was the first objective <e> <s> then the introduction of competition into the gas market and the third objective he said was the strengthening of the existing petroleum legislation <e> <s> that lacks any semblance of excitement or of real policy <e> <s> he went on to refer to the considerable achievements of the energy sector <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has rightly paid tribute to various leaders of the oil and gas enterprises over the years and to the valuable work that they have done is that not a reason for leaving the thing alone to get on with the job it has been doing so successfully in the past decade <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure we are all grateful to the noble lord for explaining the order which amends the headquarters agreement between her majestys government and imco allowing member states to establish permanent missions here <e> <s> as the minister has said the order brings imco into line with other un agencies such as fao and unesco in respect of an imco base in this country <e> <s> the organisation has some very important functions not least those concerned with marine pollution a matter of great concern to the united kingdom and indeed to many other countries as well as other specialist functions <e> <s> the order also grants as the noble lord said certain immunities and privileges to permanent staff representatives of diplomatic rank <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that we are all grateful as indeed other noble lords have intimated to the noble baroness for her initiation of this measure dealing as it does to some extent with the anomalies of the shops acts <e> <s> they have been detailed at some length <e> <s> it has involved for her a great deal of work and she has helpfully given publicity to something which urgently needs a comprehensive review this was a point made by various noble lords in this debate certainly if it is to be done in such a way as not to create even more anomalies <e> <s> noble lords have put forward various suggestions <e> <s> i suppose with a bill concerning shops acts you might call them counter proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords other noble lords have made it clear that if some shops may open on sunday they may find that they must open then because their competitors have decided to do the same <e> <s> therefore there is very little freedom <e> <s> the freedom to open on sunday is not quite the kind of freedom <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the butchers organisation was concerned that if there was a general trend towards opening with some of their members and also other trades the butchers would have to come in line <e> <s> the other aspect is that if we have the right to shop when we like then we can equally ask why not the right to bank or withdraw cash from the banks to require the services of the post office the right to go to a chemist the dentist the optician or to an accountant and other professions at the same time <e>", "<cs> i believe that the committee has listened carefully to the reply of the minister on this very important amendment which is on one of the most important matters that we shall be discussing during the passage of this bill <e> <s> i was serious when i said at the start of my speech that in view of the international situation i thought the government might have been considering whether this was the time to fragment and hand out to private control vital national assets which in the public interest should be under public control <e> <s> i listened fairly as i hope one always does to see whether the minister could assure the committee that in the bill or in the articles of association there was anything which would give the kind of guarantees and assurances which the committee has been seeking this afternoon <e> <s> but the noble earl was unable to convince the committee on this matter which is of great national interest <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down i do not want him to go into too much detail but i should like to ask him whether he would be kind enough to say a little more about the security of oil supply <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for his partial clarification <e> <s> i think this is a matter of some importance which has not been adequately satisfied <e> <s> i think it would be useful if the committee were to return to this matter at a later stage <e> <s> with those comments i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we have had a useful debate on this amendment and the minister has been pressed to clarify the situation <e> <s> i am afraid that in many ways his reply did not come up to the expectations of the committee especially as the government originally suggested i made this point earlier that the bill gives opportunities for wider share ownership among the public and the employees <e> <s> some of the points made in the debate are of very great importance particularly concerning the need to ensure that these assets are retained in british hands and under public control <e>", "<cs> the committee has shown its concern tonight for the need for greater accountability <e> <s> there is nothing in clause certainly not in subsection which will satisfy us that there is due parliamentary accountability <e> <s> the minister has obviously given us plenty of information regarding other aspects but the questions which concern the committee tonight and my noble friends in particular certainly have not been answered <e> <s> unless the government are prepared to say that they will look at this again at a later stage i am afraid that i shall have to invite my friends to join me in the lobby <e>", "<cs> i think that we have had a helpful reply from the minister who seems to have taken into account the merits of the two amendments which we have been discussing <e> <s> of course the fact remains that if we privatise any public undertaking and we say you must sell we are saying you must sell at any cost or regardless of price because that is the condition <e> <s> we are not deciding whether or not to sell we are selling regardless of the return <e> <s> in those circumstances the price will not always represent the best or the most adequate return <e>", "<cs> there is a great deal of support for the principle of the amendment <e> <s> i would refer the minister to the second reading debate when the secretary of state said <e>", "<cs> the minister expressed some surprise that this side of the committee was not forthcoming but surely this amendment falls into line with what we thought the government had in mind over the dispersal of shares to individual british people so that they can have some stake in their national asset <e> <s> also it aims to prevent shares being bought by foreign corporations or individuals and thereby ensures that the maximum dispersal takes place within the united kingdom as opposed to the very substantial oil corporations and others who would obviously seek to benefit by this flotation <e> <s> it is really aimed at the widest possible share ownership within the reach of the british people generally and i am rather surprised that the minister has expressed any surprise with an aim which i would have thought was compatible with the governments objectives <e>", "<cs> although one can display some sympathy for the aims behind the amendment following my suggestion relating to a previous amendment that we ought to await the report of the public accounts <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his clarification but he will of course be aware that this will now be a major one-product company and will no longer be part of a major international concern <e> <s> but it certainly warrants the government keeping in mind some of the problems with which the new undertaking will have to deal and the points made by the noble lord lord tanlaw seem to be relevant in this situation <e> <s> in view of the ministers reply and clarification of some of the issues i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i listened carefully to what the minister said and i had the idea that he rather suggested he will correct me if i am wrong that there was some doubt about the governments intention to privatise gas in the north sea <e> <s> he will undoubtedly have the words before him but <e>", "<cs> that is useful information but as recently as march when the standing committee in another place were looking at this particular aspect the minister said in column on nd march and i quote <e>", "<cs> in view of the ministers reply which rather suggests some fluidity in the oil and gas business and in view of the possibilities of what might be in the pipe-line i seek leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if i may join the alliance temporarily in order to get a copy of the letter from the noble earl that would be helpful <e> <s> but i must say that i am still at a loss to understand the reply given by the minister <e> <s> he may have some advantage over me in that respect but it seems to me that unilateral action here is hardly justified because it puts at least one party at a severe disadvantage in relation to the others <e> <s> although the minister may say that the provisions to which i have made reference may not be used in the way in which we anticipate one wonders why the words are necessary in the bill <e> <s> i rather feel this is a matter to which we might return later on and i would seek leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words on <e>", "<cs> i shall be brief although it worries some of us that we should be discussing certain important provisions late at night with pressure if that is the word to use in relation to gas to make even greater progress and we are tending to curtail some important discussion <e> <s> in supporting the noble lord lord tanlaw i would remind the minister that the amendment is important because it is concerned as others have been with safety and with the question who exercises it who is to be responsible for it and who is to pay for it and the government have given little in the way of a clear idea of who is to do what <e>", "<cs> various questions were asked by me and by the noble lord regarding staff and safety which have not been answered <e> <s> i presume we can return to this at a later stage <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that his reply and the comments of his noble friend indicate a great amount of uncertainty in this area <e> <s> is this not the wrong time to be adding to the uncertainty by proceeding with the oil and gas enterprise bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister of state for his explanation of the order and i welcome the draft scheme which will be of continuing help to the fishing industry <e> <s> we appreciate also the backing of the eec in respect of i think per cent <e> <s> of the expenditure incurred by member states being reimbursed by feoga <e> <s> the fish producers organisations play an important role in the national marketing of fisheries products and in the implementation of common marketing standards and of course they need all the backing that can be given by her majestys government and by the community <e>", "<cs> in winding up a few moments ago the noble lord the minister said that we seemed to be talking about two different things <e> <s> i imagine that it rather appears to your lordships that the answers rarely fit the questions <e> <s> i know that this is a technical bill and one might be excused for thinking that your lordships house ought not to be involved in such detailed technical scientific commercial financial and legal matters but that is inherent in this bill <e> <s> it had a long session going through the other place and i must say that many questions which have been posed today and indeed in the last two sittings have not been answered hence the noble lord is able to claim that we seem to be having lots of second reading speeches <e> <s> but this is a matter of life and death because we are dealing with gas we are dealing with an established set-up of known repute and the government are throwing the whole thing into turmoil <e>", "<cs> in fairness perhaps i should say that i was quoting from <e>", "<cs> they will be a mixture <e>", "<cs> with due respect to the government chief whip we have been anxious to make progress <e> <s> a few moments ago i suggested that we might take a decision on this matter in the lobbies <e> <s> i assure the chief whip that members on all sides of the committee are rather anxious about safety and there are other aspects which are rightly of concern to us all <e> <s> we hope that if we can get more direct answers and i make no personal complaint at all on explanations of government policy then greater progress will be made <e>", "<cs> i should like to reinforce my noble friends plea to the minister since there is some doubt <e>", "<cs> i will try not to detain the committee too long but this is an important clause now of course we come on to the oil side <e> <s> clause refers to offshore activities and it is particularly concerned with safety zones around installations <e> <s> this is an important clause and this debate will give the government an opportunity to give your lordships committee some information regarding the safety aspects <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord the minister for his comments <e> <s> he did say there were changes of a fundamental character although the minister of state in another place said the proposals were not designed to effect fundamental changes in our safety practices <e> <s> it was that assertion by the minister of state which made me doubtful <e> <s> after all although we are anxious to adjourn our proceedings shortly the safety of all those who work in these installations and rigs in the north sea is very important <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for his comments <e> <s> i may be able to pursue some other aspects in later clauses of the bill <e>", "<cs> before we adjourned we had changed from the gas side of the bill to the oil installations in part iv which concerns offshore activities and as noble lords will know clauses and repeal section of the act and replace it with new provisions with the application of the criminal and civil law in relation to installations including the extension of powers of constables regarding installations and in cross-boundary fields to cite the financial memorandum <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for the clarification on the points that i raised and for the assurances that he has given on some matters which must have been of concern to the committee <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak to clause and again briefly raise some questions which might be of concern to the committee and indeed farther afield <e> <s> it is advisable that these clauses do not necessarily go through without at least a brief period of discussion <e> <s> clause which is concerned with the application of civil law is probably of wider interest than the other clause though would not say that that was of no consequence <e> <s> the application of civil law as contained in the clause is of great consequence to those who work on installations in the waters concerned and which are detailed in the clause itself <e>", "<cs> if i may start on clause this is a clause which extends the application of the mineral workings offshore installations act the so-called act which makes provision for the safety of persons working on installations concerned with underwater workings on mineral resources <e> <s> it refers to gas storage installations and to the provision of accommodation of workers concerned with the installations themselves <e> <s> therefore it is an important clause <e> <s> the clause reads at the start <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for his detailed reply which i am sure will give some assurance and more information to all concerned <e> <s> as he will know the oil companies and others involved in north sea oil work and installations especially those concerned with accommodation spend large sums of money to maintain as high a standard as possible for their workers and of course they have compiled codes of practice through the united kingdom arrangements and have also accident prevention and safety awareness programmes for detailed examination of accident records and so on <e>", "<cs> we could go on debating this subject through the night <e> <s> we all recognise that we are custodians of democracy <e> <s> i do not believe this is a party matter because deep down all of us in all parts of the chamber care for parliamentary democracy and all that that means in terms of accountability and so on <e> <s> it has been said that the price of democracy is eternal vigilance <e> <s> after a long days constructive and responsible debate i am not sure the powers of vigilance are all they might be now compared with what they were earlier in the day <e>", "<cs> may i ask a technical question <e> <s> this concerns page and the reference to the employment protection act <e> <s> it will be useful if the minister can tell us briefly the implications of that <e> <s> in schedule there is a reference to the employment protection consolidation act and a repeal of section <e> <s> i was wondering whether the employment protection act is part of the consolidation measure and as the employment act was mentioned i wondered to what extent the minister may feel this is likely to be applicable to those affected by the legislation <e> <s> i notice that in the explanatory and financial memorandum it is said that the effect on public service manpower is not expected to be significant <e> <s> i wonder to what extent this reference in schedule is likely to be relevant to the people affected by this <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will agree that taking into account the discussion that we had in committee on th may we have had a good debate on this subject <e> <s> some would say that on th <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe it will be for the convenience of the house merely to say on this occasion that on a previous amendment amendment no <e> <s> to clause i think it concerns enactments and so on my noble friends made their misgivings clear and the minister gave some assurance about looking at the matter again <e> <s> i anticipate that as these amendments are much the same as those on the previous clause the same assurance might apply and the matter may be looked at so that we can return to reconsider the matter of amendment no <e> <s> at a later stage <e>", "<cs> my lords the position is still far from clear <e> <s> the noble earl will recall that when the matter was debated earlier my noble friend lord bruce of donington suggested to the house that the original capital of the corporation did not come out of the funds of the taxpayer <e> <s> he referred to the balance sheet of the british gas corporation and suggested that it would indicate where the money came from <e> <s> my noble friend said it came from subscription to gilts and all the rest of it with which the noble earl is quite familiar and that if there were to be any realisation of assets and the corporation were allowed to keep the proceeds of the enforced sale of its assets the prudent way would be to reduce some of its debts <e>", "<cs> my lords this matter will have to be further considered <e> <s> with the leave of the house i beg leave at this stage to withdraw the amendment in order that we can consider what further action to take later <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the noble lord lord tanlaw on what of course is the second time round on a matter of very great importance because it deals with the matter which has concerned the house for some weeks now that of safety <e> <s> even the amendments which were carried this afternoon in their various forms do not really get rid of some of the real anxieties which many people feel <e>", "<cs> my lords following the noble lords question i thought the comment of the minister earlier that he was not sure what uptake there would be by the private sector was fair <e> <s> we have been told on second reading and many other times that <e>", "<cs> my lords i can understand the consternation of the house as regards this particular amendment <e> <s> my noble friend was very brief in putting the position before the house and it seems to me that it is very simple <e> <s> the amendment proposes that the secretary of state shall only make provision for payment to the corporation where the corporation are required to undertake expenditure which they would not otherwise have incurred <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt <e> <s> i think the noble lord mentioned charges being on an equal basis wherever possible <e> <s> my noble friend lord bruce mentioned commerciality of the gas under bgc <e> <s> as the noble lord knows the government had many millions of pounds through the gas levy which has come from the charges imposed by the bgc <e> <s> does commercial mean including a levy or sub to the government <e> <s> secondly will the gas levy be applied not only to the bgc in future but also to the private operators as well if an even-handed approach is to prevail <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not arguing the merits of the levy <e> <s> we want to know whether the levy will be paid only by the gas corporation in future and that there will be no levy paid by the private sector <e> <s> this means that the gas corporation gas will not be competitive because nationalised gas will be much dearer than private sector gas for they are paying a public subsidy to the government <e> <s> if that happens i hope that the government will not make comparisons about the high cost of gas board gas as compared with the private sector <e> <s> can the minister clarify this situation <e>", "<cs> my lords then why levy on one and not on the other <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will appreciate the clarification which the minister has given on these aspects and i feel that it will be very helpful to the industry <e> <s> i presume that he has been in touch with the industry and also with the trade unions concerned in these matters <e> <s> that kind of consultation is of course very helpful in producing the clarification which has come from it <e>", "<cs> my lords i wrote to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate to notify him that i intended to raise a number of questions on the amendment in the light of very recent discussions which i understand his department has had with the oil industry in order to clarify the situation which is of concern to those involved with marine regulations affecting flotels <e> <s> i should very much like to be associated with the comments made by the noble lord lord tanlaw <e> <s> together during the committee stage <e> <s> we raised some of the questions which we are now bringing back <e>", "<cs> my lords the proposer and indeed the industry will appreciate the comments and clarification given by the noble and learned lord the minister <e> <s> there is no need for me to stress that the industry is very anxious that there shall be appropriate regulations and legislation suited to the particular aspects with which it is concerned <e> <s> i feel sure that the industry is anxious that it shall have a reasonable amount of time to adapt its installations to conform with the regulations but certainly it does not wish to be in breach of any regulations and hence the comments made by the noble lord lord tanlaw and myself <e> <s> we would thank the minister for his reply and anticipate continuing close co-operation with the industry <e> <s> with the leave of the house i beg to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord for his explanation of this amendment <e> <s> i should like to ask him two questions <e> <s> the general rate act concerns local authorities and valuation <e> <s> can the minister say a little more about the basis of valuation assessments for public or bgc pipe-lines and apparatus <e> <s> with regard to the assessment of private pipe-lines one can imagine the problem which will arise where the bgc pipes are conveying gas from the private sector <e> <s> there will be a very close integration of the two and one wonders how the valuation of the two will be brought about <e> <s> secondly may i ask what consultation has taken place with the local authority associations and others so far as the governments intentions over the rating and valuation assessments are concerned <e>", "<cs> my only other question was about consultations <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down will he say if there is no parliamentary scrutiny and the gas corporation are forced or made to do something which is not otherwise covered by law whether they would in fact be liable for the consequences of their action which may be the breaking of of contractual obligations as regards safety or otherwise or whether the minister giving the direction would assume that responsibility <e> <s> one can appreciate that where such directions come before the house or before parliament it is parliament making a new enactment which overrules the previous legislation which many would not dispute <e> <s> but in cases where it does not come back to parliament by either form of resolution is one to presume that the gas corporation will have to bear the consequences of doing what the secretary of state directs <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> i am sure that we do not agree with the essence of what he has said but the matter has been debated at length by the house and therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the house will be extremely disappointed about the ministers reply and not only disappointed but concerned as well <e> <s> i should like very briefly to recap the situation which has been referred to by my noble friends lord underhill and lady fisher of rednal <e> <s> the amendment that we earlier proposed would have been an addition to the proviso of clause of the bill which as we know deals with the disposals of assets <e> <s> what the house agreed on an all-party vote and this is of course a non-party matter was to add in respect of disposal of assets the words <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall also try to be as brief as possible but this is an important bill and after many days of debate in the other place and in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords the last sheep variable premium protection of payments order to come before your lordships house was i think on th june last year two weeks after i was introduced into your lordships house <e> <s> it is pleasant to have this what might be yearly event <e> <s> that concerned the punching of holes in the ears of sheep for certification <e> <s> today we have another order which again involves the marking of sheeps ears and as the noble earl has said is concerned with the lambs which are smuggled southward across the irish border and the need for marking those coming into great britain from northern ireland <e> <s> i suppose that in the circumstances it might be appropriate to refer to such action as being designed to prevent illicit ewe turns <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister accept that spain has if not the largest fishing fleet then a fishing fleet which is as large as any in the community and does he accept that this situation is one of the consequences of having no agreed common fisheries policy <e> <s> how soon are the government going to get a settlement which is now urgent and one that takes into account the fact that the vast majority of the fish in all the community waters is within our -mile limits <e> <s> is this not essential if our fisherman are to get a net return profit <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome this amendment the substance of which as the noble lord indicated was raised during debate in this house on nd march on an amendment tabled by the noble lord lord renton to which i gave support on behalf of the opposition <e> <s> as i said in the earlier debate the words without lawful excuse do not appear in the convention nor in legislation which other countries have tabled <e> <s> these are important points <e> <s> i agree that the inclusion of the phrase without lawful excuse is bound to suggest that there could be circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords as the amendment indicates the offence of hostage taking is added to the list of offences in schedule to the suppression of terrorism act a measure which gives effect to the convention on the suppression of terrorism <e> <s> i think it is appropriate thus to extend it by this amendment which i welcome <e> <s> in view of the fact that the passing of this measure and the amendment to the suppression of terrorism act are most urgent i wonder whether the noble lord can indicate at this final stage the chances of getting ratification by the number of countries required to bring the convention into effect <e> <s> i understand the number required is <e> <s> it is urgent not only for the defence of british citizens in this country but also for the defence of our own citizens and indeed others in other countries <e> <s> if the noble lord could indicate that i think it would be reassuring to your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl the minister accept that successive governments have been pressing vigorously for a settlement which is fair and represents the fact as i have said before that most of the fish in eec waters is within our -mile limit <e> <s> is the minister aware that the industry fears we may revert to what was anticipated several years ago that eec countries will be fishing up to our shores with equal access <e> <s> one wonders whether the same principle might apply to eec wine and that we might share it instead of others claiming that it is theirs <e> <s> is the noble earl aware of the anxiety in the fishing industry that while as the noble lord lord campbell of croy has said the industry has adapted a great deal it is unable to adapt to some of the things it fears unless agreement is reached <e> <s> is the decision to be a matter for veto or majority decision <e> <s> these are very important aspects <e> <s> the sooner we get a settlement which is fair the better for everyone concerned <e>", "<cs> not enough <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house is grateful to the noble lord for describing the regulations which i welcome and which have already had detailed scrutiny in another place <e> <s> as the minister said the aim of these regulations is to implement the requirements of two harmonisation directives dealing with feeding stuffs <e> <s> they also regulate and control substances and additives in certain feeding stuffs and details of sampling and the analysis for enforcement <e> <s> this is very desirable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that your lordships will be grateful to the right reverend prelate the bishop of rochester for the way in which he has detailed the provisions of this measure <e> <s> i am pleased speaking from these benches to give a welcome to the measure because it will facilitate the efforts of the church of england in providing for clergy pensions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that once again the house is indebted to the right reverend prelate for the way in which he has detailed the proposals and has explained their need <e> <s> i should renew my declaration of interest as a church commissioner for the last years including a period when i was second church estates commissioner in the other place and had the pleasure to present such measures there <e> <s> experience of some of the changing situations with which this measure seeks to deal has given me a fuller appreciation of the need for the measure and it has also given me an awareness of the sensitivities and the anxieties of the wide range of organisations and individuals interested not only in the function of the church but in the life and concerns of the wider community <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord give us figures for the year because the figures for total about million which rather suggests better exports for the year than the figures given <e> <s> are the government satisfied that the woollen industry research association is still able to help to keep our industry competitive <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure we are all very grateful to the noble earl for introducing the order in the way he has and for explaining it to your lordships <e> <s> i certainly do not intend to go into some of the details which he has given to clearly so your lordships <e> <s> i think we would welcome his initiation to the agricultural sector and i am sure that despite his short acquaintance with the industry no one will doubt from the previous debates the fact that he is very much in touch with the grassroots if i may put it that way <e> <s> the noble earl has no relief tonight because this is his third order and he still has one more to go but my noble friend lord blease who is also so well identified with northern ireland affairs has one more to go and i am very pleased to be able to give him some relief at any rate <e> <s> i am sure that some of the points i shall make which i shall do as briefly as possible are points that he would have made <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down may i mention the relevance of the two matters of manioc and the less favoured areas which i raised <e> <s> unless one has the basis for prosperous agriculture one has very little to market <e> <s> the two points i raised are ones of current concern in northern ireland <e> <s> with regard to the less favoured areas i appreciate that northern irelands application or the application to northern ireland will be part of the application of the united kingdom generally <e> <s> but there is a special need for northern ireland because of the very much smaller areas concerned and the areas which would benefit from that charge <e> <s> with regard to manioc i appreciate that the minister will write to me and i shall be in touch with those who have been in correspondence with me on the matter <e> <s> with those comments i thank the noble earl for his reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure we are indebted to the select committee under its chairman the noble earl lord cranbrook who has just introduced the report <e> <s> we are grateful to him for the way in which he has outlined this very detailed report and has referred to its conclusions <e> <s> we value the contributions made by all those who gave evidence both in this country and abroad <e> <s> the subject of course is one of great importance at a time when all forms of pollution seem to be increasing and the quality of life is diminished because of it <e> <s> noise is one of the factors in this because we gradually get used to higher noise levels and we may not realise the effects of it on individuals and on the local environment generally <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that one should pay tribute to my noble friend lord houghton for his continued vigilance with regard to the wellbeing of animals <e> <s> although he and many members of societies concerned with animal welfare often hit the headlines with their claims of alleged cruelty to animals indeed they are not always allegations for they say that there has been cruelty to animals i think your lordships will recognise that they are not the only ones who care <e> <s> we all share concern some working behind the scenes as indeed has the noble lord lord zuckerman in order to solve the problems <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house is grateful for the ministers explanation of this brief but important order <e> <s> as he points out the order makes various amendments to the planning northern ireland order <e> <s> i have studied the order and compared it with previous legislation <e> <s> i should like to raise one or two points and to ask the minister questions on them <e> <s> first i would welcome the order as a step forward in this matter <e> <s> the main amendments have several welcome features including the transfer of the appeals against enforcement orders from the courts of summary jurisdiction to the planning appeals commission <e> <s> there appear to be some advantages in this in so far as it will ease the case loads of the courts who deal not only with planning matters <e> <s> i may be right in thinking that planning appeals commissions will be specialised and i hope will allow a degree of informality and continuity in decisions and policy matters <e> <s> if so this is to the good <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are grateful to the noble earl the minister for reading the statement which has been given in another place <e> <s> i should like to put a few questions to the minister <e> <s> after all the stages of the bill he will of course be aware that we have very strong views on this side of the house that such vital and successful national assets should not be sold <e> <s> but is the noble earl aware that even among those who agree to the sale there is deep concern because although the secretary of state says that he will sell subject to market conditions in november there is a feeling that he is determined to sell this year regardless of the consequences <e> <s> this view has been made a number of times in the responsible sections of the press <e> <s> will the noble earl assure the house that he will be flexible on this in view of possible changing circumstances <e>", "<cs> that is right <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not detain the house for more than a minute amount of time of about seconds in making my final remarks <e> <s> i believe that your lordships will feel that whether we agree with the ministers conclusions or not he has done his hest to answer the many questions which we have asked of him tonight <e> <s> i want to stress a point i made during my speech that whether we agree with the governments overall policy or not we all have a real duty and responsibility when these orders or legislation come before us in relation to this act to give them the closest examination and this applies particularly to members on the other side as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for repeating the statement made in the other place <e> <s> will the minister bear in mind and make clear to our eec partners at all times one vital fact which cannot be repeated too often and that is that over per cent <e> <s> of the fish in the so-called eec waters are within the united kingdom -mile limits <e> <s> on that basis would he accept that when he refers in the last few words of the statement to the allocation of the fishing stocks fairly between member states this must mean an agreed preference in zones in quotas and in other ways for united kingdom fishermen in view of our major united kindom interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that all the fish within our -mile limit belonged to britain <e> <s> i said that it does justify a preference for british fishermen including scots <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the minister for passing to us the statement read in another place <e> <s> as the house will know after the long debates on the oil and gas enterprise bill which is now an act of parliament this statement is a progress report by the minister on the sale of a great national asset which has produced vast amounts of oil for the nation which has been an industry of great profitability and which has substantially contributed to the treasury through taxation and in other ways so we are not dealing with some industry which has failed the nation and run into debt <e> <s> it follows that such an important statement requires detailed and careful probing and that the issue of more details later does not help the house at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords may i finally ask the minister this question in view of the uneasiness which is obvious in the house <e> <s> despite the assurances of his noble friend lord boardman the house really is not <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure we are grateful for that explanation of the order which is not controversial and is a consolidation measure as the noble viscount pointed out <e> <s> he mentioned the repeal of section <e> <s> i note that there are provisions dealing with orders regulating remuneration and holidays that comes under sections and <e> <s> they are important sections regarding powers to fix remuneration and holidays by order <e> <s> they include the publication of prescribed notices to all affected by the proposals and the submission of written representations regarding them <e> <s> there are also of course powers of enforcement <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble viscount sits down will he comment on the backdating aspect of articles and which i thought <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord the minister for outlining the purpose of this bill in commendable detail <e> <s> we are grateful to him for outlining also the provisions that the government have introduced in this measure to deal with what i am sure we all feel to be a pressing and urgent problem <e> <s> the minister has provided the house with information about existing legislation which will be seen to have grown piecemeal over a period of many years with successive governments attempting to deal with the problems and attempting also to prevent evasion of the legislation in order to reduce if not eliminate injustices and exploitation <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord glenarthur for his introduction of this timely measure <e> <s> in debating a summer time order we should recognise that there are dangers of being misunderstood if we use such terms as may apply to other measures which come before your lordships house such as putting the clock back which i am sure does not apply in this case in fact with the concessions we have i suppose we can say that time is on our side <e> <s> in the meantime we shall have to take care <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will thank the noble lord for reading the statement which was given in another place <e> <s> however does he really think that the statement is a little more sober and more realistic than some of the secretary of states rather bouncy comments made in a broadcast of yesterday when he talked about the great success of this flotation <e> <s> he referred then to the success of the issue <e> <s> this is hardly the kind of comment which is made by responsible and experienced financiers and others in the city <e> <s> the secretary of state has now presided over two disastrous incursions into privatisation <e> <s> the house will recall amersham international where the speculators made a killing and now britoil where only a small percentage of the shares have been sold showing a great lack of confidence in the issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the sponsors motives in bringing this bill to your lordships house giving an opportunity to debate defence policy aspects and to seek clarification from the government <e> <s> those who support government policy will no doubt be equally grateful for those who will the general policy have an even greater responsibility for examination of it than those who do not or at least an equal responsibility <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord avebury has already covered some of the points which i had to raise <e> <s> in view of the possibility that the minister may have another look at this matter i shall with the leave of the committee withdraw the amendment and will not proceed with amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for moving amendment no <e> <s> and for speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> as he said some of them are drafting amendments <e> <s> i anticipate that the amendments go some way towards meeting some of the points of clarification <e> <s> but later we shall be having a debate on subsequent amendments standing in my name and in the name of the noble lord lord avebury which are wider than the points made by the minister on this occasion <e>", "<cs> i feel sorry that the minister has not been a little more forthcoming i do not know whether he was the minister at the time but the housing act which was passed by this government of course said this in section <e>", "<cs> my noble friends and i are rather disappointed at the ministers reply <e> <s> as the noble lord lord avebury said this is an important i amendment on this part of the bill in clause <e> <s> we believe that the requirements of the measure are not strong enough by any means especially when you have regard to the problems facing the occupier <e> <s> we believe that the act should provide that the site agreement should be unenforceable for as long as no statutory agreement has been offered <e> <s> if there is any aspect which should be determined then we believe that the court should do that <e>", "<cs> i am sorry about the ministers attitude to the period of three months <e> <s> the amendment has other merits that i have mentioned <e> <s> i made the point previously but i am afraid that i have to remind the committee of various points which apply in a number of circumstances and so i would say that when a person buys a house or bungalow it is necessary to have the help of a solicitor at least in most cases and so to some extent the persons problems are taken care of <e> <s> but in the kind of cases that we are considering people do not normally receive legal advice and so they may have to use other means in order to obtain information about their rights and responsibilities <e>", "<cs> i shall place more trust in the minister than some might say would be justified <e> <s> i hope that he will look at this point again together with the other aspects of the amendment <e> <s> i do not want to press it at this stage but we might return to it later <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i can well appreciate the points made by the minister <e> <s> he talks about the danger of accommodation drying up <e> <s> this is any form of accommodation including mobile homes which are used by a not insignificant number of people <e> <s> a problem to a tenant or owner of a house is a per cent <e> <s> problem to him and we should take that into account <e> <s> if we do not have the housing act and the rent act safeguarding these people as i and <e>", "<cs> i think we are still hopeful that the minister will look at this again <e> <s> we feel very strongly about it and are inclined to press the matter but it is one which needs to be given more care and attention <e> <s> the minister will know that his own department as have noble lords has had piles of correspondence on the matter <e> <s> there have been many letters sent and the press have had campaigns about the various injustices suffered by residents on mobile home sites <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the committee is very disappointed with the ministers reply <e> <s> he talks about being fair between the two sides <e> <s> i felt that his reply was well balanced on the side of both in that in one respect one point applies and in another something else applies <e> <s> i gather the bill does not allow a premium but does not prevent it <e> <s> it does not make it an offence to charge a premium <e> <s> the minister went <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to detain the committee for more than a moment but in relation to what my noble friends have said i would remind the noble lord the minister of the doe report of which at paragraph says <e>", "<cs> many think so <e>", "<cs> i think we are in need of some kind of arbitration and i hope we do not have this by means of a division if it can be avoided as it can be by the minister saying that this is clearly something which needs looking at again <e> <s> from all the debates which have been held in your lordships house and in another place the minister must know the position on mobile homes and he will have read the debate in another place on th july when mr nicholas lyell and his honourable friend nicholas baker took part in an adjournment debate on this matter <e> <s> if one reads the terms used by those two honourable members on the ministers side of the house i am not sure whether i would be in order in quoting them i think one finds that they say in effect that in practice the mobile homes bill is riddled with flaws anomalies and loopholes <e>", "<cs> i should have thought the minister might be more forthcoming on this matter because although we do not want to restrict or put too much in the bill there is a need to give more guidance than is in it already and to have more safeguards <e> <s> we think there would be room for substantial unfairness and injustice in agreements if we do not pass this kind of amendment <e> <s> it would be very difficult for people who are not legally qualified to challenge the terms of such agreements <e> <s> of course we are also concerned with agreements which can be terminated and then the security of tenants is also affected <e> <s> i am sure we are unbiased as well it will be in the interests of the site owner also to have this clarification and i hope that whatever the ministers response may be to this the matter can be looked at before the later stages <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to go on for too long but this also concerns security <e> <s> it is easy for any landlord who wants to exploit or to get rid of a mobile home resident to say that a mobile home is having this kind of effect on the amenity <e> <s> the test is used as we know on many occasions when a site owner wishes a tenant to buy a new van or a new mobile home and to buy it from him as part of the conditions <e> <s> it is subject to exploitation <e> <s> while i recognise some of the points made by the minister it is very difficult to define the words in the bill at this stage <e> <s> it might be useful if the minister and my noble friends and i were to look at this point between now and the later stages <e> <s> with those comments i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord the minister believes in the market economy will he at least take a look at the right of the site owner to have first refusal <e> <s> if the site owner has to consider buying the caravan or mobile home in competition with others this is preferable to the kind of monopoly start which the bill gives him at the moment <e> <s> will the minister look at that <e>", "<cs> the amendment seeks to give the same kind of facilities to the tenants of mobile homes as to other tenants which have been referred to on a number of occasions today <e> <s> i have another amendment which deals with the same section and it may well be that the matter will come before the house at a later stage <e> <s> i am grateful for the ministers comments and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his comments on that and i anticipate that he will automatically be in touch with many organisations and individuals who may have made earlier submissions on his previous documents <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend had been here a little earlier i am not sure that he would have been so keen on giving the compliments to the minister that he has <e> <s> however this is the last amendment <e> <s> the reason for moving this amendment among others was as the minister knows that there is controversy where you have say metered services as to how much should be paid for gas electricity and so on <e> <s> he knows that charges for electricity often spark off controversy and this kind of amendment would help to eliminate that <e> <s> the minister has been forthcoming on this and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the minister for repeating the statement which has been made in the other place <e> <s> this is of course a very important statement and rightly a full one and we look forward to studying the implications of it in the white paper in due course <e> <s> we welcome the replacements announced for losses and the re-equipping from british sources <e> <s> this is most important not only for the job situation but also as an acknowledgment of the superb skill of our designers and workpeople in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords accepting that the minister is right in saying that the two biggest problems in the mbfr talks are the data problem that of the agreed assessment of mutual forces and verification may i ask him what further steps the government have in mind to resolve those two matters which have been at the base of our disagreement for about nine years <e> <s> further would he consider recommending a freeze on force levels on both sides as well as giving support for a nuclear test ban treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount not think that it is more important to try to understand the points of view of our nato partners and that he might deplore some of the political points which are made on occasion which do not really enhance the important cause of european security and of world peace <e> <s> can the noble viscount say when further meetings are likely to take place between the government and the french <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount the minister aware that last week not only on this side but in other parts of the house concern was expressed about the conditions under which the forces are living in the falklands <e> <s> although the concession involving telephone calls is admirable is not the noble viscount aware that there are difficulties in regard to the calls being made <e> <s> will the minister be prepared to give a fuller statement on conditions when the house resumes the debate on the falklands after the recess so that we can see exactly how far the government have been accommodating in these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords although we appreciate the fact that the government may not want to have undue restrictions we welcome both the bringing of these activities under air safety regulations and pilot licensing <e> <s> but surely the main object in the long run is to see that monitoring takes place and that the controls such as they are are enforced <e> <s> can the minister also briefly say something about the noise aspect which also has been causing concern <e>", "<cs> my lords the debate on which we are engaged tonight has been partly initiated because of the lack of assurances which though demanded have not been forthcoming from the british government <e> <s> the government do not help themselves in the handling of the matter of control of bases sited on british soil or indeed in british territorial waters as was evident when my noble friend lord jenkins of putney brought here for second reading only a few weeks ago his bill relating to bases <e> <s> as the government do not help themselves and as they believe that such bases are justified they ought to accept that natural fears should be satisfied as far as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble viscount sits down may i say to him with all the christmas spirit i can muster that i do not think he helps his case by the type of smears of association with which he ended his remarks <e> <s> he must surely realise <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate is timely because the whole country is concerned about peace <e> <s> in recent times those who have dared to mention the word peace or who have been known as peace lovers have been in the minds of some the objects of ridicule <e> <s> i think that now only a few days from christmas we should be able to say that many members of the party opposite have been found sending messages concerned not only with expressions of peace but also of goodwill <e> <s> so we may therefore assume that the word peace is acceptable for a few days at least over christmas <e> <s> but very soon in the new year reality will break through blest we hope with the christmas message <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indebted to the noble baroness the lord privy seal for the way in which she has introduced this debate on the white paper on the falklands campaign and its lessons and for giving more detail about the governments thinking <e> <s> while we are grateful to the noble baroness for appearing at the dispatch box on this occasion i should like to pay tribute to the noble viscount lord trenchard <e> <s> although we did not always agree we appreciate as i am sure most members do the contribution he made <e> <s> i am sure that we look forward to his part in the debate today <e> <s> the noble viscounts going from office deprives this house of a spokesman with direct responsibility <e> <s> we all know of the great interest which this house always shows in defence matters and although the two noble lords whom the noble baroness has mentioned will have responsibility in this matter and are highly regarded nevertheless the loss of a defence spokesman with direct responsibility will be regretted by many noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> i am grateful to him for giving way <e> <s> before he goes on rather rapidly making what seems to me a rather less positive contribution than he might he did say that i was critical of the prime ministers visit <e> <s> what i said was that she made what she called a personal pilgrimage to the falklands albeit without the foreign or defence secretaries <e> <s> that was the sum total of my comment and i think the noble lord might even agree with me that it would have been better if she had had those two very important and relevant secretaries of state with her to assess the situation which she and indeed parliament will have to deal with for a long time to come <e> <s> that was not a criticism but a positive suggestion as to how it might have been even more helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i say that i think the house appreciates the positive effort the minister has made to satisfy some of our questions <e> <s> the point i want to underline is that made by the noble baroness the lord privy seal on this and other occasions when she and others have implied that unless there is some certainty about the future and that is not an easy matter we shall not get the investment and support which is absolutely essential to improve the economy and viability of the falklands <e> <s> this is very important <e> <s> i appreciate the difficulties the government have on this but in the long term and indeed in the short term this is one of the most essential aspects of the future of the islands <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that yesterday in the other place a defence minister said that in the absence of concrete results in the inf negotiations in geneva the deployment of cruise missiles would start at greenham in december <e> <s> will the minister say first whether the government are satisfied with the present safeguards which ought to ensure that the british government have control of any weapons and secondly what the governments aims are at geneva in view of the fact that negotiations have gone on since december <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has said that he is not yet quite sure what powers he has as a minister of state <e> <s> having been one for five years all i can say is that he probably has more powers than he thinks <e> <s> i do not think he will have to say to us i shall consult on this but i can actually say that i will agree to it <e> <s> on this occasion i do not expect him to say that he accepts the amendment but i should like to think that considering the merits of what we seek to do he will look at it again <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are disappointed at the minister not being more forthcoming on this <e> <s> without an agreement there is no protection <e> <s> we believe that if the making of an agreement is delayed maybe for reasons of uncertainty and this we are trying to correct in this bill or because the site operator as i said earlier when quoting the doe document is not keen on an agreement being made for obvious reasons then there is no protection for the mobile home occupier <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it would be desirable in order to complete this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house are pleased at the tone of the ministers reply to this amendment <e> <s> the amendment is an important one and i suspect that he is not fully happy with the six months period <e> <s> nevertheless his reply justifies my seeking the consent of the house to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister quoted my noble friend lord jacques but i should like to quote from what he himself said at col on nd december during the committee stage <e> <s> i quote <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that this is a very important matter <e> <s> it is so easy for people who do not know too much about the law to sign on entry into a site an agreement which has a clause which says that the site owner shall decide on his own arbitration <e> <s> if you sign that agreement you have very little say at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i can accept what the minister says that we do not want to clutter up the courts <e> <s> but i should like the minister to reconsider the matter from the point of view of the status of the arbitrator who should be someone not only impartial but also experienced in the matters which would be referred to him <e> <s> it is not only about rent levels but is also about reasons why someone should terminate an agreement and get off the site <e> <s> we suggested last time the royal institute of chartered surveyors <e> <s> if the noble lord could have another look at that we should be grateful <e> <s> with those comments i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this seems to be a matter of drafting and clarifying the powers of the court for the area concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is right to claim credit and we would give credit to the government for bringing forward the bill but it does not follow that because the government have brought forward the bill it is automatically all right <e> <s> even the government themselves would not accept that <e> <s> of course the house is very anxious in the light of the enormous press publicity and the concern which has been made clear to many organisations and through various bodies about the loopholes in the act <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this is a very important amendment because although the minister seems to suggest that there has been no pressure for this kind of thing in fact the doe review says at paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i am far from happy with that reply but at this stage i still live in hope and i think that we might live to look at the matter again <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two points here <e> <s> one is the point about the occupier having difficulty in selling a mobile home to anyone else because as we have said before the number of sites with planning permission are so few <e> <s> where it is a condition that the van is therefore sold to the site owner the amount offered by him for it even a van could be or <e> <s> after all he can decide because if the occupier cannot sell it to anyone else then the site owner will buy it at his price <e> <s> the second point is that he will decide on a new van being sold to the occupier at his price on which he gets a profit <e> <s> a third point is the one where we return to the disagreement on the meaning of the word arbitrator <e> <s> if it is to be joe bloggs who will decide on the condition of a mobile home as i said i do not want to weary the house on this it could be a friend or relative of the site owner then the interpretation would not necessarily be the one which would come from the courts <e> <s> we have already debated the determination of agreement by the courts rather than the arbitrator <e> <s> on the ground that the minister might look again at the status of the arbitrator which would give us more assurance i am prepared to seek leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his reaction and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords living in hope we feel that this is a matter which can be looked at again and <e>", "<cs> had given notice of his intention to move amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment deserves much more time than it is to be given today and i hope that we can come back to it again or that at least it will be considered later <e> <s> surely the minister is treating mobile home occupiers as second-rate people because he is not giving to them the kind of rights that are afforded under the housing acts to other tenants and that is really quite unjustified <e> <s> surely in matters of the resale of electricity the prices charged should be what one might call the current prices <e> <s> it is possible for the site owner to buy electricity at one price and to sell it at a much greater price and at an unjustified profit to the occupiers of mobile homes who as we have said are mainly elderly people <e> <s> in fact the elderly and young people with families represent the majority of the type of people living in mobile homes <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to clarify the position <e> <s> i am not saying that the government are treating these people in a second-class way <e> <s> i said just now that i supported the government and i praised them for bringing forward the legislation but bearing that in mind as well as the fact that we are trying to improve the legislation i should not like that kind of accusation to go out <e> <s> it is important that we close as many loopholes as possible <e> <s> i believe that the bill has had the support of noble lords in all parts of the house and we have been constructive as well as brief in our attempts to help the government to produce a bill that will be worthy of the job that they are seeking to do <e> <s> with those comments i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord harris of greenwich has provided an opportunity for the house not only to ascertain the policy of her majestys government in relation to the unstarred question that he has asked but also to consider among other things the motive which prompted the noble lord to table it <e> <s> the speech that we have heard from him indicates that he is concerned on several grounds as indeed is the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> i am speaking about a resolution which has been detailed to your lordships house that the council supports the action of the greenham common womens peace camp and so on against the proposed siting of us cruise missiles in britain <e> <s> i am keeping to the subject a little more than some of the noble lords who have spoken up to now and who have introduced matters such as empty houses and so on <e> <s> this is in the resolution and i am only anticipating some reasons as to why the council should have passed such a resolution <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may pursue my case and the noble lord will get some idea as to the situation <e> <s> i was in local government for many years before i went to the other house <e> <s> i was leader of bristol city council chairman of its finance committee and so on <e> <s> therefore <e> <s> i know something about the responsibilities of local councils <e> <s> the noble lord raising this matter tonight is what one might call interfering in local government <e> <s> the noble lord lord tordoff rightly said that parties do not like governments interfering and outsiders telling other people what they ought to do <e> <s> here we are with the noble lord lord harris telling the council what they ought to do <e> <s> the electors have taken the decision and if the electors do not like what is happening then undoubtedly the time will come when they will express their view <e>", "<cs> my lords the ministers reply is most important and reassuring in view of the particular responsibilities that we have in that area <e> <s> can he say anything about the general policy of liaison between the united kingdom and the united states on matters of common concern especially on this aspect <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there is rapidly growing concern among many people on matters of nuclear warfare <e> <s> he might ponder on whether listening to a few million voices on the topic would be more productive than would be lecturing through a million pounds worth of propaganda <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i understand that in the area of the noble lord lord clifford of chudleigh the devon county council under conservative control is banning the cnd from using accommodation <e> <s> does he think that that is one way of answering some of the genuine fears that people have <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the minister rather prejudging the surveys findings in his reply <e> <s> will he not accept that the fact that the government are setting up a survey which i am sure we all commend is a recognition not only of the publics concern but of the governments concern on this matter <e> <s> will he recognise also that the tests which took place on christmas island in indicate in the time of the h-bomb that there is a much greater incidence of danger now with nuclear weapons <e> <s> will the government take those aspects into account in respect of civil defence and also make the findings public in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for the way in which he has moved the third reading of this bill which as we know began its parliamentary process in this house <e> <s> it has had a detailed examination within the time allowed for it and it goes on its way we anticipate for other constructive contributions to be made <e> <s> the bill is a very important one for although the number of people living in mobile homes is relatively few in relation to those who live in other forms of housing the problems faced are in many ways much more demanding <e> <s> many who buy mobile homes become owner occupiers because they are elderly or because they want a place which is more easy to run and with fewer rooms <e> <s> most of all of course and this is common to many who buy mobile homes they want a place which is much cheaper than other forms of housing <e> <s> the elderly people as i have <e>", "<cs> my lords on this motion i shall be very brief <e> <s> i should like to recognise the way the government have helped in accepting some of the amendments <e> <s> i think i ought also to say a brief word of thanks to all the organisations outside which have provided information and still have a job to do during the remainder of the bills passage <e> <s> i would pay tribute in particular to the national consumer council who have not only looked at the detailed provisions in the bill in relation to the doe survey but have also been prepared to help members of all parties quite impartially in improving the merits of the bill <e> <s> although the minister has gone some way towards what we want i believe he still has a chance to show possibly in the other place that he is even more accommodating to mobile home owners <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he will comment on the first part of the question about the governments proposals for spending money <e>", "<cs> my lords at the end of a busy day for the minister and his colleagues would he care to listen at oclock tonight to a radio play entitled when the wind blows which may be relevant to this question and may give him some idea of the natural fears and anxieties of ordinary people <e>", "<cs> my lords while recognising the concern of the noble earl will the minister remind his noble friend that the nato alliance which all the main parties in this country support is concerned not only with peace but also with the preservation of free speech and that on that basis he has very little to fear <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that on most occasions to order british products will competitively meet the technical requirements for the product and that this is of course due to the supremacy of british design and workmanship <e> <s> i would emphasise the importance of buying british especially in defence products in order to establish export markets <e> <s> one has in mind particularly the anti-radar missile and other projects which have been referred to in the house recently <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indeed grateful to the noble lord lord carrington for having introduced this debate and although the terms of the motion are very specifically in two parts i believe that <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the intervention of the right reverend prelate because this is an important point <e> <s> i wonder to what extent people voted for the resolution that was carried as a kind of compromise not being sure how they should vote in the other two directions <e> <s> i make the point because there is growing concern and anxiety which may have been expressed in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords i was only reading the resolution but it shows how much careful consideration this important motion justifies <e> <s> i hope that the government are considering all these matters with very great care <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down may i put a point to him <e> <s> as he seems to have given instant comment which seems to have brushed aside most of the points of the synod resolution may i ask whether he will say that the government will give very serious consideration to all those points including the one about parity which the noble lord lord gladwyn mentioned <e> <s> will he say that the government are going to give this great consideration in the future or will he be honest and say the alternative that the church has been wasting its time <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of our commitment to the defence of the falklands which involves the lives of many of our forces in the falklands area and also those of falklanders themselves and other resources is the noble lord the minister really satisfied that the situation is logical and right in relation to recent events <e> <s> the noble lord must be aware that members of both houses from all parties and indeed the country have expressed a concern about these matters <e> <s> does the noble lord the minister not agree that he ought to put a statement in the library outlining the governments policy not only to reassure noble lords but also to give guidance to the country on this very important matter <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister consider my question about placing a statement in the library so that members may be reassured about the policy in relation to our own country and also in relation to other nato members <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that spending money to raise the living standards in the third world and other places is one <e>", "<cs> my lords when framing the new regulations will the minister take into account the recent observations of the british medical association and have some regard to whether they might be a factor in the reluctance of many authorities to go ahead with civil defence or other planning <e> <s> can the minister reply to the bmas observations in order to give some assurance on these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords before the hiccups extend too far and the praise gets out of hand will the minister say what economies have been made in the higher reaches of the manpower services in local government <e> <s> can he say to what extent the savings are offset by the costs of unemployment and other benefits concerned <e> <s> have the government assessed the social consequences of not spending money on some very essential services <e>", "<cs> my lords could the minister say what is meant by the word palatable <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware of the general support for the shackleton proposals particularly in respect of agricultural and farming land <e> <s> is he aware of the strong concern that there should be better prospects of land tenure and ownership <e> <s> having regard also to the fact that per cent <e> <s> of the land is owned by the falkland islands company will he facilitate through the falkland islands development agency and other means the speeding up of the prospects not only for local people <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister not only heed the views of the media the television and the radio but also accept that he can be substantially helped and encouraged in this matter by some of us who have been in the falklands in recent weeks and who on matters of farming and agriculture have been closely in touch with the grass roots if i may put it that way <e> <s> will he realise the urgency of this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords although the minister says probably rightly that he is satisfied with the progress made may i ask him to tell the house about the number of schemes and miles of roads which have not been made in recent years including by-passes and so on <e> <s> has he worked out the consequences of that in terms of delays accidents and other effects to offset the aspect which he would claim was creditable that of saving public money <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree with the prime minister who i believe has said quite clearly that there is dual control and we need have no worries or with the defence secretarys fairly recent remark that billion would be concerned <e> <s> if this is a joint effort surely there is no justification for one ally to pay another ally this enormous amount of money <e> <s> will the noble lord also agree that there is a growing amount of concern on all sides in both houses of parliament regarding the need for control jointly by both powers <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that with the escalating costs of even bigger and better if better is the right word to use weapons which can be far more devastating the trident which the government seem to be so keen on will be out of date <e> <s> in view of the fact that trident will cost about billion is he aware of the widespread fears on all sides that this amount of money for this nuclear potential may mean that we are not equipped adequately in the conventional role and that in the event of an emergency we shall go nuclear before anything else <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make it clear to the minister that i was not advocating a better weapon than the one which the government propose <e> <s> i was <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister acknowledge the importance of this question that a situation could arise in which under dual control or dual consultation the use of cruise missiles from united kingdom bases may have to be authorised by the president of the united states and the british prime minister <e> <s> will the minister say what contingency plans there are if the prime minister is again caught as in the case of the falklands by an attack which to use her words comes out of the blue in a situation where the president of the united states is perhaps at a sporting event while the british prime minister is perhaps attending her hairdresser and someone has to make a decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i too pay tribute to the noble lord lord kings norton for the way in which he presented the report and tribute must go to the committee for the enormous amount of work they did to present the page report which we are discussing <e> <s> the amount of work they did can be seen from the interviews with witnesses from reading their detailed submissions when considering the comments of the committee and after studying their conclusions <e> <s> noble lords will recall the last report of the select committee also introduced by lord kings noton on another aspect of industry and i refer of course to the report of the european communities committee on natural gas which was before the house on st october <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister takes the attitude as he does of a kind of indifference about supplying arms to argentina even only a fortnight before hostilities started in april last year is it unreasonable that noble lords should express concern about events since <e> <s> in the light of the cold and clinical disdain of the prime minister when the franks report was debated in another place is it not inconsistent that her policy allows not only the sale of arms to argentina but also the means to pay for them <e> <s> were there no safeguards in the imf loan <e> <s> after all i believe the chancellor of the exchequer was for a time chairman of the meetings which took place and we could have sought safeguards from our allies to ensure that british forces in the argentine did not meet with weapons supplied by their own country <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord for having outlined the matter before the house <e> <s> he may recall that on previous occasions when i have spoken to these orders of the london docklands development corporation and indeed to the merseyside orders i have expressed some concern that the methods of ensuring progress should be such as to get the full support of the local community as well as adequate resources to carry out the job <e> <s> this debate is really about the needs of the people of this area of dockland and how they can best be accommodated <e> <s> of course their needs are a rejuvenated area brought to life with essential amenities and they include the development of industrial sites in order to bring work and jobs <e> <s> the needs include housing development by the public authority for those in the greatest need taken as a social service and not merely as a profitable venture <e> <s> of course there is the need to develop leisure and other amenities <e>", "<cs> that is what i am asking my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that having local knowledge is not good enough <e> <s> after all what we are talking about is accountability <e> <s> if there are locally elected representatives who are in touch with and answerable to the people that is more democratic than appointing members to the lddc and trying to get them to work in an environment which is not always harmonious <e> <s> regarding the vacant properties of which the noble lord spoke it obviously follows that while local authorities are going ahead with improvements to houses and other buildings in their areas those properties will be vacant <e> <s> it is authorities which do not do much which can boast that they have few vacant properties although they have people living in substandard conditions <e>", "<cs> the minister certainly shall <e>", "<cs> i have been there <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister give greater recognition to the importance of my noble friends question which is an echo of some of the contributions that i made in the debate on defence initiated by the noble lord lord carrington when i claimed that in an emergency our human resources would be at least as great in their importance as our weaponry <e> <s> in the short period for which this government will have responsibility before the general election how will the government act to engage million unemployed in the wartime effort not forgetting the considerable contribution that could be made by our many senior citizens <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for explaining the order which we welcome because as he said it brings into effect the intention of the government supported by the official opposition and other parties and the hopes of many in the industry as expressed by the recently passed pig industry levy act <e> <s> the levy was introduced in response to grave concern expressed by the industry about aujeszkys disease and as he said the order gives power to the meat and livestock commission to raise the levy the proceeds of which will be used to pay compensation and other costs necessary to control and we hope eradicate the disease affecting pigs <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down may i explain the nature of my question <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for his explanation of these orders and to give a welcome to them because they substantially help british agriculture which over the years has made a very substantial contribution to our own food needs and to vital united kingdom exports <e> <s> productivity in our food and agricultural industries has been extremely good and has been an example to other industries <e> <s> as i have said before if only the productivity of other industries had matched that in the agricultural sector there would be fewer problems <e> <s> but in order to maintain such a record the pursuit of excellence must be a continuing objective especially in competition with the eec producers and in particular the french and other growers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for having explained the order which is concerned with rateable value and not the rate poundage but as he has implied the two are very much connected and influence the total amount of the rates paid <e> <s> i notice that under section of the local government act the secretary of state is required to consult local authorities and others and from what the noble lord has said i understand that that has been done <e> <s> i do not know what consultation normally means to the government more often than not it means that they tell people what they have actually decided but i gather that in this case there may have been true consultation in so far as there was an exchange of views which the local authorities welcomed <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recognise i am sure that he does the great importance of this question on space warfare <e> <s> will he accept that the oscar-winning film gandhi and i am sure that noble lords congratulate all concerned with the film is a recognition of the example and the life of gandhi which many people see as being in direct contrast to international defence policies that seem to be hurtling the world towards destruction <e> <s> will the minister express to his right honourable friend the prime minister the sincere hope of i am sure many millions that she and other world leaders will take stock of defence policies so that in due course she and others may like gandhi be the subject of international acclaim <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the minister for having repeated the statement made in another place <e> <s> a few questions may be relevant at the moment although the house will have to await the statutory instruments when they come later <e> <s> may i stress first of all that my noble friends and i are not against young unemployed people being given a sense of purpose and being willing to accept some degree of discipline so that they are ready to meet the demands of a working life <e> <s> that is very important to those who are jobless <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to reply to two questions that i put to him which i think he overlooked <e> <s> one was about a gratuity at the end of the period of service <e> <s> i also asked the minister for an assurance that those who are unemployed will not be pressurised at the expense of their benefits to go into this or any other scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the government policy or perhaps the lack of government policy on this vital matter is leading to land speculation and also to the acquisition of what will become unviable units <e> <s> i understand that the noble lord has had correspondence on this matter <e> <s> if he has read it and studied it as he might is he aware that there is a great deal of concern about this matter <e> <s> it is being claimed that for a sum of about either raised by capital loan or mortgage it is possible to buy a house and to have sheep running on acres of land <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister recognise from correspondence of which i have received a copy and i know that he has had a statement from people representing the independent farmers there that there is a great deal of <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister and the government for a commendably detailed report which goes far beyond the important aspect of lead in petrol and into other aspects of the environment <e> <s> we welcome the report of the royal commission under the chairmanship of professor southwood and thank him and the members of the commission for their work and recommendations which we shall all study with interest the report having only just become available <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the minister will accept that the matter of the export of arms and ammunition to the argentine is an on-going policy <e> <s> will he accept that the house is probably even more concerned with the policy pursued in that matter since march and will he give some indication of the general principles which now apply in relation to it <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is indeed grateful to my noble friend lord kirkhill for having raised this issue of energy which is so important to the nation <e> <s> without adequate energy of the right kind and at a reasonable price our ecomomy could not function <e> <s> there is another factor which is of vital importance and that is long-term confidence in the securing of supplies <e> <s> we certainly need an overall and comprehensive strategy with the long-term aspects in mind <e> <s> i know the importance of energy and energy strategy because for nearly years i had the honour to represent newark in nottinghamshire which is an area with six coal mines some oil interests and power stations in a part of the east midlands which has deservedly won the title of the powerhouse of the country <e> <s> i was pleased also to hear the contribution of my noble neighbour who represented mansfield for many years too <e>", "<cs> my lords that is precisely the point i was making and i am glad to have the noble earls clarification <e> <s> the whole point behind the case for the principle of public ownership is that one cannot expect the private sector to risk enormous sums of capital and other resources in providing these essential social services <e> <s> therefore the public sector has to come into it <e> <s> if the case for the private sector is that we want industry to stand on its own feet and not to be interfered with by whitehall then we must recognise that even sending a cheque as a public subsidy is a form of interference <e> <s> one cannot have it both ways <e> <s> if the public are going to put their money into the private sector surely there should be some say-so as to how this money is spent and what policies are pursued in its spending <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble earl might recall what he said a few moments ago <e> <s> i thought he agreed with me when i mentioned about the uncertainty of those investing massive sums in the industry <e> <s> we have to rely of course on the private sector in future to decide what is profitable rather than what is socially essential for the national interest <e> <s> you cannot have it both ways <e> <s> those who are involved in the risk investment in the private sector have to look at the income rather than the job which the investment has to carry out as in the case of the public sector <e> <s> one thing the government will not recognise is that such industries are so important that their responsibilities the supply of energy and so on make it essential that their main overall concern must be the public need first and foremost <e> <s> in providing those social services <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to have the opportunity briefly to contribute to the motion moved by the right reverend prelate in support of the church of england general synod measure which is now before the house <e> <s> as your lordships may know i am a member of the ecclesiastical committee and also a church commissioner <e> <s> i am pleased to support the measure <e> <s> the measure as the right reverend prelate has said does not effect major changes but it would permit a number of detailed uncontentious points to be resolved <e> <s> this it was thought would help towards simplifying the churchs legal procedures <e> <s> the measure comes from the general synod of the church of england has been considered to be expedient by the membership of parliaments ecclesiastical committee and should receive our support <e> <s> i give the measure a welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am pleased to support the measure before us and as the right reverend prelate has said it has come from the general synod of the church of england and is a consolidation measure including the pastoral measure of and the pastoral measure of which as your lordships will recall was debated last july <e> <s> as we have been told there are other statutory provisions set out in schedule <e> <s> as we have been told this is a consolidating enactment and does not amend the existing law except in regard to some rather minor and insignificant matters <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister advance any reason why his noble friend who of course is always tolerant and impartial should query the cost of policing an anti-nuclear demonstration but not for instance the policing which is quite properly done at the cenotaph <e> <s> will the minister reflect on this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord hatch of lusby for raising this important matter and for the opportunity it provides not for more confusion but i hope for clarification <e> <s> i want to endorse as my view the view he expressed at the beginning of his remarks that this is not a matter of considering whether a unilateral multilateral or any other point of view should be put forward in the literature concerned but it is a matter of considering the merits of how the views should be expressed <e> <s> we are indebted to the noble baroness lady cox and to other noble lords who have spoken for putting a view because this should warn the government indeed any government that once a view is put on matters about which people of any opinion feel deeply there is a danger of opposing views being encouraged and <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister recognise that when under previous governments certain agreements were made there was a very different rgime in charge in argentina <e> <s> the situation has changed since as he well knows <e> <s> will the minister recognise the need for some consistency and make a policy known on the matter of the export of arms <e> <s> although he says there is a ban on exports from this country he must be aware that machinery and parts do get sent to europe to become parts of vehicles and ships which go to the argentine <e> <s> having regard to the presence of british troops in the falklands will the noble lord consider whether that is to our disadvantage in the near future not least of course with the workings of the imf which has recently with government support encouraged more financial aid for the argentine rgime <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure we are all indebted to my noble friend lord jenkins of putney for giving us the opportunity to debate this life-and-death matter of nuclear weapons to be based on united kingdom soil <e> <s> he began by saying that there was a good deal of goodwill on this matter <e> <s> in view of the limited terms of the question he said he did not seek to castigate that was the word he used on this occasion but only to interrogate <e> <s> it is also a good thing and to the credit of our democracy that we can debate these issues here or indeed at greenham common <e> <s> long may it continue although of course we hope that we shall get some more answers to the questions which have already been detailed by noble lords tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the noble lord giving way <e> <s> i was about to intervene to make the point the noble lord made that under the agreement there was dual control of the thor missile <e> <s> now of course the minister says you cannot expect it on cruise because it is not owned by us but jointly owned <e> <s> surely it we are allies working together in any emergency there is just as much case for us to have dual control in the present situation as there was previously in the case of thor <e>", "<cs> no it only seems like it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister give some thought to the need to keep the cost of petrol down especially if there are any changes in the lead content <e> <s> i think he will recall that exactly four years ago today at the last general election petrol could be bought for about p per gallon and that price has now almost doubled <e> <s> if the present trend continues and if the present government stay in office the cost of cars and motoring will be such that the only vehicles to be seen will be in motor museums <e>", "<cs> my lords i am here <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister look at cruise in relation to general defence policy <e> <s> did he see in the <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indebted as several noble lords have said to the noble lord lord spens for raising this aspect of licensing laws concerning public houses and of course the various licensing acts including those affecting scotland <e> <s> as several noble lords have pointed out as long ago as the erroll committee reported on the situation <e> <s> thirteen years later the situation has changed radically and new licensing laws are needed as a result of further consideration especially to deal with the inconsistencies in the law to which reference has been made by various noble lords <e> <s> the noble baroness lady trumpington made reference to a report from the justices clerks society which i have also received <e> <s> it is a very valuable report called <e>", "<cs> i am also retired my lords so we are still level-pegging on

legal advisers to the magistrates of england <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that on the eve of an election where the prime minister is claiming that britain stands on her own feet and is respected in the world we have a situation where although there is a joint decision on cruise and other missiles there are no joint operational checks <e> <s> can the noble lord imagine a situation in the united states where allied missiles were fired only by the british and not by operational control with the americans <e> <s> will he recognise the deep concern there is in this country not only on one side but in all parties where people are most anxious about the need for dual control <e> <s> is it not really quite monstrous when we are allies with the americans that we cannot have dual control because we shall have to pay them rather a high cost to get it <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that in the recent exchange it was said that the agreement referred to the thor missile <e> <s> this is rather different so does the agreement still apply in the case of missiles which are not owned by us <e> <s> will the minister tell us briefly where the government stand in our relationship with the united states <e> <s> at the geneva talks we are not present but the united states is <e> <s> in the case of our having cruise missiles on our soil the fact that there is no dual key means that operational control is in the hands of the americans <e> <s> are we satellites of the americans or are we allies especially in the use of weapons based on our own soil <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government considered the recent report of the bma on the effects of nuclear energy and will the government make known their views on these horrific consequences at the same time as they make known the information for which the right reverend prelate asked a few moments ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for having missed a few seconds of the noble lords opening speech but i have anticipated what he said <e> <s> i welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords we welcome this amendment as an improvement to the bill as the minister has said <e> <s> it gives greater protection and it improves the previous situation where the site owner himself could terminate an agreement whereas now the court will have to do so <e> <s> that appears to be a much greater concession than is actually the case because the definition of the court in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am pleased to say that we welcome the amendments moved by the noble lord <e> <s> once again they help the bill <e> <s> one of the main concerns about the need for a bill at all was the fact that mobile home occupiers do not normally have the kind of security which those living in other forms of accommodation almost take for granted <e> <s> they are not covered by the legislation which covers others <e> <s> concern arose over the situation of for example elderly people wanting other accommodation or young people with families wanting other accommodation <e> <s> when it came to the time for sale of the home we all realised the problem of getting another site or selling to someone who has planning permission to go elsewhere <e> <s> in many cases that is virtually impossible <e> <s> having to give the site owner first option to buy at a much lower price of course represents a very big loss on the investment made by those concerned <e> <s> we certainly welcome the abolition of the site owners right of first refusal and the reduction of the commission to per cent <e> <s> i think many of us would like to have seen the commission on sale abolished altogether <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to see the new leader of the house in his place <e> <s> like many other noble lords i was associated with him in the other place <e> <s> i am also pleased to see the new foreign affairs faces on the front bench <e> <s> i should like to pay tribute to the work of the noble lord lord belstead <e> <s> he often pursued his brief with some competence even if the essential agreement was not already there <e> <s> i wish also to pay tribute to the noble lord lord cameron of balhousie on the occasion of his maiden speech today <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister recognise the importance of the two points made by my noble friends question <e> <s> will she really take a look at this matter now that she has replaced two of the former ministers who had some responsibility <e> <s> also will she not be misled by the last comment <e> <s> this is a serious matter not only because the family referred to is involved but because other people may be misled into thinking that the prospects there are better than they are <e> <s> will she urge the falkland islands government to do something about using their powers to acquire land which i understand they have the right to do especially with regard to the monopoly of the fic which has per cent of the land although this is not the only monolopy which inhibits growth <e> <s> will she realise how urgent this matter is if people are not to be misled into going to the falklands without knowing the whole position and if more are to be brought in with better facilities <e>", "<cs> my lords in fairness to the noble lords point could it not also be claimed as indeed some do claim that because the general belgrano was sunk this scuppered the peace talks and led to a campaign which was costly and which will continue to be costly <e> <s> out of fairness will the prime minister and the government consider setting up an inquiry into this matter so that the facts can be known on all sides <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recognise the seriousness of the point made by his noble friend especially as regards the british position <e> <s> will the minister say what the criteria were in relation to the alternative sources of material <e> <s> further can he say what aspects were taken into account in reaching this decision which set a very difficult precedent for british interests <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that there is hardly any source in the public or private sector from which the government do not demand some money to go into their coffers <e> <s> is it really in the best interests of forestry that the commission should be <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord misunderstood the question <e> <s> i believe that it is a fact that land sold by the forestry commission on the instructions of the government may not necessarily be used for forestry purposes in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the minister for not making my point clear <e> <s> i was asking him whether he is aware that under the forestry act land sold on the instructions of the government need not be used for forestry purposes in the future and that this could represent a loss of timber and forestry amenity <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister answer the question asked by his noble friend lord boyd-carpenter in which he referred to our relationship with spain <e> <s> will the apparent pulling out of gibraltar raise the hopes of the spanish government <e> <s> have the

today so i hope to be brief <e> <s> my noble friend lord hatch of lusby and indeed all who have taken part in this debate have spoken with clarity <e> <s> i may say in passing that it is interesting that while the other place has been debating what to do about the death of individuals in a developed country your lordships have been discussing the death of millions of people in the third world <e> <s> i am sure that we look forward to the time when the two issues are the cause of equal concern and publicity <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for repeating the statement which has been made in the other place <e> <s> i shall put to him one or two questions as briefly as i can <e> <s> i believe that they cover the main aspects of concern <e> <s> is the minister aware that the house will view with some concern the breakdown of the arrangements announced as recently as days ago <e> <s> does he recall that on st july the minister said that the common fisheries policy as a whole laid the ground for a fisheries policy for the next years and that he was optimistic <e> <s> that was despite the arrangements announced as recently as january <e>", "<cs> my lord we are all grateful to my noble friend lord houghton of sowerby for giving the house yet another opportunity to discuss this important matter and to hear the views of her majestys government <e> <s> we are all indebted

the same degree of independence in the future as she showed when she sat on the benches behind the one on which she now sits <e> <s> i have no doubt she will take note of the views of all noble lords who have spoken this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene very briefly <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down may i assure her that we do appreciate the assurances she has given <e> <s> however the assurance that there will be more inspectors is not quite the same thing as an assurance that there will not be an inadequate number of inspectors <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel sure that the house will welcome the order which has been introduced by the minister <e> <s> i should like to underline the remarks he made about the personnel of our armed forces <e> <s> i had the benefit of going to the falklands only a few months ago and was very impressed by the calibre of the task force particularly since they had to travel miles before they reached their destination and faced the major challenge of the falklands campaign <e> <s> from the technical point of view we were all impressed by the strategy and by the weaponry and high technology with which our armed forces are equipped <e> <s> as both i and i am sure other noble lords have mentioned previously the men and women who serve in the armed forces are our greatest asset so far as our future defence is concerned <e> <s> therefore i fully support the ministers comments <e> <s> it is most important to keep morale at a very high level <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister recognise that the noble baroness is not the only one in waiting for changes in the law <e> <s> may i stress the relevance of the noble lords question relating to the need for a review of the shops act in the light of changing circumstances <e> <s> will the minister recognising the effects on the british way of life and in particular family life give an assurance that there will be widespread consultation with the trade the trade unions the local authorities the churches and other bodies <e> <s> finally will the government give what help they can to ensure that the legislation produced is soundly drafted and adequate to the circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that the minister is reluctant to make any changes where there is not complete agreement on legislation may i ask him whether he will ensure that the same principle applies to other aspects of our legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the minister for repeating the statement made in the other place <e> <s> is he aware that there is concern that the practice of statements on important policy matters such as this being made as the house goes into recess allows no opportunity for the house to examine matters in more detail and to debate the various aspects <e>", "<cs> my lords may i follow up the ministers replies to my own and other supplementary questions <e> <s> i am sure that there is a feeling of some doubt about the governments knowledge of the meaning of the word consultation <e> <s> it seems that what the government mean by consultation is just telling people what they have decided whereas true consultation is telling people what you have in mind asking their views and being prepared to modify your plans <e> <s> in the case of nato the eec the lisbon agreement and in relation to the noble lords question about the experience of the falklands there is still an element of doubt <e> <s> i believe that the house will go into the recess with a feeling that the wording running through the gibraltar rock is one of compromise which will cost us dearly in the future <e>", "<cs> that is the beginning <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that the freeze might be the starting point for <e>", "<cs> my lords why do the government persist in their doctrinaire policy of hiving off parts of very profitable nationalised enterprises profits which are of course necessary to offset some of the loss-making social assets <e> <s> will the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble viscount the leader of the house for outlining the policy of the government in respect of defence a most important subject which has attracted a considerable number of speakers today many with great authority <e> <s> the maiden speech of the noble and gallant lord lord lewin was welcomed and will be welcomed on many occasions for the weight that we must give to his conclusions <e> <s> it has been a wide-ranging debate <e> <s> there has been the criticism of the noble lord lord hill-norton about some of the misleading answers of the government and his concern about the maritime role there was the very substantial speech by the noble and gallant lord lord carver claiming the merits of the conventional role in preference to the nuclear a study which we should be well repaid for reading later <e> <s> there was the concern of my noble friend lord cledwyn and the noble lord lord mayhew especially about the dual control and on the conclusions of the geneva talks <e> <s> there was the idealism of my noble friend lord brockway and the independent voice of my noble friend lord stewart of fulham apart from the general concern expressed by many noble lords including the noble lord lord gladwyn and others on trident <e>", "<cs> it has been sold off <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a good debate tonight and we should pay tribute to the noble lord lord alport <e> <s> there have been very good speeches which i would not want to repeat especially from my noble friend lady nicol from the right <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord tell the house how many millions of public money have been put into nationalised industries to pay for redundancies and other factors in order to make them more attractive for piratisation <e> <s> for instance can he say whether the increase in gas prices is an attempt to make the industry much more profitable and therefore more attractive to the private sector <e> <s> will he give some assurances for example in the case of british telecom that many of the socially necessary services which do not make a profit such as the presence of telephone facilities in rural areas will still continue despite the piratisation of the public sector <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept the importance of this question in respect of having internationally agreed definitions of airspace and also procedures <e> <s> will he also accept that it is essential to have agreed procedures to deal with violations in a safe manner

will be grateful to the minister for reading this very important statement to the house <e> <s> we are grateful also to the secretary of state <e> <s> i understand that he has travelled some distance in order to come to parliament to make this statement at rather short notice <e> <s> perhaps the minister would comment on that <e> <s> in view of the fact that the secretary of state is keeping his promise to inform parliament of the deployment of missiles does this not suggest that he had very little knowledge of when the missiles were actually coming to this country <e> <s> if that is so then surely the state of consultation between the united states and ourselves is something which could be vastly improved <e> <s> does the minister not agree that even when a minister is acting possibly as a type of messenger from the united states he should have good notice before he delivers such messages to parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the comments by the noble lord lord orr-ewing which allege that members on these benches are not anxious that the soviets should also proceed towards disarmament may i ask whether the minister recalls that i asked him whether he expects the soviet union to continue negotiations when the government have taken the action that they have <e> <s> the promise earlier in the year was that if the talks fail after christmas then deployment will take place <e> <s> apparently talks are still taking place and deployment is proceeding <e> <s> that surely will torpedo the possibility of success of these important talks which are vital to both sides <e>", "<cs> my lords is there no chance of the united kingdom being represented at these talks instead of being represented by the united states allies though they may be in view of the fact that the labour party has sent its former leader mr <e> <s> foot and also mr healey and mr callaghan to the soviet union to talk on these matters <e> <s> we are often told that if we have these weapons we have a right to put our legs under the table but in this case britain is not represented <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will listen he will see the relevance <e> <s> with the experience of the <e>", "<cs> my lords it is possibly the effect of too much television on the noble lord lord mayhew <e> <s> i was making the point and i think that the observation is a fair one that recent experiences have given us grounds to doubt whether there is proper control by the british government <e> <s> the noble lord lord mayhew never gives up trying to score party points where national interest is still at stake <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down as he has made what he thinks is a valid point against my noble friend lord jenkins for a motion which he seems to suggest is compatible with unilateralism would the minister say why on so many occasions when he claims that most people are multilateralist still per cent <e> <s> of the population are insisting on dual key control <e> <s> that is surely what the whole motion is about <e>", "<cs> my lords did the noble lord the minister read those aspects of the brandt report and the recommendations which suggested that if we can raise living standards in such parts of the world we shall get rid of some of the tensions which cause us to spend more on negative forms of defence <e> <s> that would be positive defence rather than negative defence and is that not an aspect that the government should consider in their defence policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i have given the minister notice of what i intend to raise and i am advised that the best time to raise the matter is now <e> <s> the opposition have no wish to oppose the motion that we go into committee and <e> <s> indeed we are anxious to get on with the bill but i think

the minister for repeating the statement here <e> <s> the country will be greatly alarmed although not surprised that the inf talks have broken down for the government were warned that insistence on going ahead with the deployment of missiles here could lead to the soviets acting in the way they have <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down may i say without any hint of rebuke that i did not refer to the shooting down of the korean airliner <e> <s> what i did say was that in the light of the grenada experience i wondered whether this was not a reason why the united kingdom should take some major initiative <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister say what are the proposals to which she has made reference <e> <s> will the government take an initiative on the matter in view of the great insecurity for the people of the falkland islands and the enormous cost <e> <s> will she say where the government stand in relation to the prospect of united states arms sales to argentina <e> <s> this is an urgent matter on which the government should take an initiative <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that our membership of the cap means that we pay much higher prices for food within the community than do people outside <e> <s> will the minister urge his ministerial friends in the government to show a little more fight to keep prices down within the community than they have shown in relation to the situation regarding the milk regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister take a little wider look than at the cost of food to the consumer <e> <s> because the consumer as a taxpayer has to pay hundreds of millions of pounds for storage for getting rid of surpluses for intervention and for all the other matters which after all have to be added to the cost of our food in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister accept that although the united states is our closest ally that did not stop them in the so-called consultation before they invaded grenada telling us what they intended to do and going ahead <e> <s> will the noble lord make sure that the meaning of consultation is the same on both sides of the atlantic <e> <s> as a final safeguard will he ensure that we get dual key to make sure that no mistakes arise <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord stoddart of swindon said on the earlier stages of the bill we welcome it and i would not wish to impede its progress for more than a moment or two <e> <s> we welcome it because it brings into effect some of the policy points for which the opposition and others have been pressing which ought of course to encourage greater development of the north sea oil resources <e>", "<cs> i wish to move the motion standing in the name of my noble friends in relation to clause <e> <s> this clause deals with the succession aspects of the act and presents and alternative to those tenants of the future <e> <s> the bill is of course mainly clauses and and the intention of the bill as the minister pointed out on second reading and since is to ensure that more people have entry into the farming industry <e>", "<cs> i think that we have had a useful debate on this matter <e> <s> one of the main points in my noble friends tabling this motion was to get the house to realise that there are other aspects of entry into farming besides the one in clause <e> <s> noble lords opposite will be familiar with them <e> <s> there is the high cost of entering farming <e> <s> the high capital cost prevents many young farmers from getting a farm of their own no matter what the availability may be <e> <s> then there are problems of taxation and the problems of loss of agricultural land which is mentioned in paragraph of the report of the noble lord lord northfield <e> <s> between and the average recorded loss of land for farming in the united kingdom was about hectares <e> <s> which as noble lords will know is acres <e> <s> the change in farming structure is also mentioned in paragraph <e> <s> the advance of technology means that there are fewer people working on farms <e> <s> this is reflected in the number of people running farms <e> <s> there is farm amalgamation <e>

not to think that because they have brought forward this bill they have solved the problem <e>", "<cs> in the absence of the noble lord lord gibson who is chairman of the trust and of course i declare an interest may i say that the case <e>", "<cs> my lords we thank the noble lord lord kennet for raising this important and timely matter <e> <s> it may be late at night and there may be few members speaking but this matter is of vital importance now that missiles have been deployed in the united kingdom <e> <s> we should all be quite clear about the control arrangements with no possible doubt or possibility of error because our futures are at stake <e> <s> one should stress the fact that this question implies no criticism of the united states <e> <s> but good relationships depend on knowing agreed procedures and ensuring compliance with them <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister briefly whether he will send me a copy of the correspondence which he is to send to the noble lord <e> <s> i am sure he will confirm there is no possibility of any united kingdom citizens being shot by us personnel at a time of a possible breach of security <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness recall the fear which gripped the world following the incident <e> <s> is she aware of the grave concern which many have in all countries that if such an incident occurred again with a nuclear dimension we should not be able to ask questions and sort out the merits afterwards <e> <s> can she say what initiatives the government have taken with other countries including the united states and the soviet union to see that such an incident does not happen again <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble baroness lady vickers i had the great pleasure of going to the falkland islands on their th anniversary with one or two other noble lords present here <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl accept that the possibility of an accident even though remote will cause grave concern to the public after seeing the film this weekend <e> <s> in view of the fact that the cruise missiles are mobile will the noble earl ensure that the maintenance of them is such as to guarantee the safety of the people in the areas where they may be stationed <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the question asked by his noble friend lady gardner of parkes regarding the records of this administration and the previous one why did the minister not tell her that thanks to the levy on gas and electricity something like million has been added to the bills paid by everyone including pensioners <e> <s> does he agree that his concern to help the poor is hardly consistent with the proceeds of such a tax going to the government and being designed eventually to help higher income groups by reducing their income tax <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the committee is disappointed with the ministers reply <e> <s> there are several aspects to which the noble earl has referred which make one wonder to what extent the government have really made a proper appraisal of the whole situation of the balance of taxation royalties and so forth <e> <s> during the second reading debate in another place on th july last the secretary of state said <e>", "<cs> i accept that <e> <s> i know that there has been mention of that <e> <s> but the noble earl has not really given any reason why the government should give away what could be a massive sum of money <e> <s> various quotations have been made about what the effect would be <e> <s> i believe on second reading that the minister mentioned the decrease in payments from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> and he said that he was willing to give an illustration of a field with million tonnes of reserves <e> <s> there was a benefit there of per cent <e> <s> which on a billion or billion field would be worth about million of relief <e>", "<cs> in the previous amendment there was an attempt to prevent in effect a subsidy or grant being given to those who did not necessarily need it <e> <s> i say did not necessarily need it because the government could not or preferred not to give any figures to estimate the loss of potential royalty <e> <s> the north sea is an asset of vital importance to the nation <e> <s> its income is enough to finance the million or more unemployed and who are jobless as a deliberate result of the governments economic policy <e> <s> therefore the income from the north sea which the nation so essentially needs for the redevelopment of our industry is being used to finance million people for whom the government have no need <e>", "<cs> i was making the point that the last change was a big concession and this one is even less justified on top of that <e> <s> the minister has not given the figures which justify the point that he has just made <e>", "<cs> i certainly in no way ascribe to those concerned with oil production the description mentioned by the noble lord lord tordoff <e> <s> i believe that the industry has a great record but i feel that the moves that we have been discussing this afternoon cannot be justified <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say in what circumstances such a force would be used in the united kingdom or outside and also what qualities are needed by the force which are not already met by other forms of our armed forces <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister give the house the assurance that the governments defence policy is still based on the use of conventional weapons and that the enormous cost of nuclear weapons will not deprive us of those resources <e> <s> if he cannot give us that assurance will he therefore be admitting that in the event of a serious emergency the united states and the united kingdom will be forced to go nuclear right from the start with the terrifying prospects which that would bring <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the growing feeling internationally that little progress will be made in any nuclear talks in the usas pre-election period <e> <s> will the government themselves in support of the comments made by my noble friend take their own initiatives to see that progress is made and that the future of mankind is assured <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for replying to the private notice question which has been tabled by a liberal member in another place who has constituency interests in the matter <e> <s> i feel as the noble lord lord grimond has suggested that there are a number of questions to which some reply is needed relating to a situation that could have serious international consequences <e> <s> the minister if i heard him correctly i make no complaint about the fact that we have not all received a copy of the reply that he has given said that it is extremely unlikely that fish will be affected <e> <s> however the situation is serious <e> <s> one wonders about the delay between the incident happening and the information becoming known <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for coming back so quickly <e> <s> in regard to my question about imco and the law of the sea facilities i recall that when i had the noble lords responsibilities within the ministry i became aware of the enormous quantity of shipping that sails in the various waters concerned and also about the need for effective international action and monitoring to prevent such a situation arising again <e> <s> i am talking not only about this situation but also about others which are unforeseen arising from time to time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all grateful to my noble friend lord jenkins of putney for having raised this matter <e> <s> perhaps it would be helpful if i were to read out my noble friends question which is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the noble lords support <e> <s> that is the point i am making <e> <s> one wonders whether we can afford both <e> <s> an increasing number of people are coming to the conclusion that with our technology and our designers and with the more much more lethal effect of conventional weapons we are in a situation where the conventional role should be a sufficient deterrent <e> <s> it is important to note that my noble friend in his question tonight talks about agreement on all sides <e> <s> it is not a matter of us doing it and not the others <e> <s> he is asking the government for an initiative <e> <s> this is important if we are to avoid escalation which could lead to a holocaust <e> <s> so our nuclear commitment is forcing us to spend more on nuclear weapons at the expense of conventional and many noble lords and members of the other place seem to be of that opinion <e> <s> the fact is that we have the conventional weapons which should have sufficient deterrence <e> <s> if one could get agreement on that it would be to the advantage of both sides <e> <s> the height of the nuclear threshold depends on our conventional resources and tactical nuclear weapons lower the threshold of an all-out nuclear war which is the point that the noble lord has been making <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down may i say that we appreciate his co-operation in putting that statement in the library on the matters that he mentioned <e> <s> would the noble lord clarify for the governments sake and ours his reply on not accepting on first use <e> <s> does this mean that we may use nuclear weapons in response to a conventional attack <e> <s> if so does not this confirm the alleged comment by general rogers that we may have to go nuclear after a few days <e> <s> i think it would be useful if he would clarify that <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all indebted of course to the noble lord lord ezra for giving the house the opportunity to discuss and debate a matter of timely importance because in more recent times even the most ardent pro-marketeer has seen the community leaders lose the sense of fellowship and <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not criticise the noble lord for not being in the chamber <e> <s> the echoes of his stirring speech are still going round the walls <e> <s> he was minister of agriculture and he was in brussels perhaps at two different periods <e> <s> i am sure he has seen the gladiators bearing their lances and that must have been as plain as a pikestaff <e>", "<cs> my lords he is shaking his head and unless he would like to intervene i take it that he agrees with what i was saying <e> <s> he knows only too well that this is one of the main factors <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord but there is no conflict at all because he <e>", "<cs> my lords in initiating this timely debate the noble earl lord kimberley has performed a service by bringing to the attention of the government and of the house the subject of the special needs of her majestys forces and how they might best be met <e> <s> after his commendable speech i shall try to avoid repetition and will seek only to emphasise a few of what i believe to be the most important points <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister say whether in the light of the noble lords question there was specific agreement to the gradual approach or a blanket agreement to a speech <e> <s> have the falkland islands government since made any recommendations on those lines <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that there is some concern about the monopoly situation over the ownership of land with the falkland islands company and also that the information from councillors there and from others in the islands seems to indicate that there should be much greater speed of action on land reform in order to solve some of the problems <e> <s> it seems that the majority of people support the recommendations of the shackleton report <e>", "<cs> my lords after the speech of the noble lord lord woolley there is hardly anything i can say to help come to what i think would be a conclusion of the debate on this subject <e> <s> we have had an extremely good debate this afternoon <e> <s> on behalf of my noble friends in opposition we pay tribute to the minister for the work he has done <e> <s> someone said that no predecessor of his i am one of them could have done more to be co-operative in this matter <e> <s> we recognise the way he has co-operated following his wise agreement to take back clause at a much earlier stage <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has made an amazing observation <e> <s> i will not go into the difference between a labyrinth and a maze but i may be right in what i said that any legislation of this sort <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a weakness of the ministers case that he has called in aid some matters which are quite irrelevant to those that we are discussing <e> <s> with regard to the report which we have quoted surely this legislation is not retrospective <e> <s> the lettings figures concerned are subject to the legislation on succession and the provisions of this measure will not come into force until a date to be given later <e>", "<cs> my lords i endorse the comments made by my noble friend lord northfield <e> <s> the matters that the minister has put before the house in these amendments are indeed welcome <e> <s> we appreciate the amount of work that has gone into the amendments that we are now considering <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the business still outstanding i shall be brief but i want to endorse some of the words of the noble lord lord sandford though of course i speak for the opposition <e> <s> the amendments are apparently the result of the consultations which have taken place with a number of bodies including the national trust and i again declare an interest as a member of the council <e> <s> in the absence of the noble lord lord gibson i should like to say that the government have gone some way towards meeting the pressures which were obvious during the committee stage <e> <s> indeed some of us were rather concerned that the minister showed less than what should have been enthusiasm for some of the points which had been made <e> <s> i feel that again we need to stress that conservation is not one-sided that it should be a partnership between the landlord and the tenant and all those concerned and that in many ways it is really good husbandry in itself <e>", "<cs> this is the kind of amendment which deserves the support of every noble lord tonight <e> <s> as my noble friend has said it provides more opportunity for entry into the industry something which this bill is all about it is invoking the aid of a body which is already established with a very good record of service to the country with over a quarter million acres of agricultural land <e> <s> it is accountable to the public for what it does and there is no compulsion <e> <s> it is land given quite voluntarily to the treasury in death duties and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister accept that the reduction in the weapons to which he referred is really a reduction in numbers of weapons which are less effective and their replacement by much more lethal weapons than ever <e> <s> will he accept that if the government continue to go towards parity in some ways this is leading to escalation and the only hope is to pursue the policies which my noble friend lord cledwyn has just referred to in the negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has just said that the figures lead to some concern and we therefore have cause to urge him to reconsider this matter <e> <s> the whole point about this bill is to provide more land for letting and therefore more opportunity for people to come into farming <e> <s> in the many hours we have been considering amendments and the legislation generally there has been very little evidence that the bill will make any difference to the present situation <e> <s> indeed noble lords sitting behind the minister have been foremost in defending the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add that further to what was said in the last meeting of the house on report stage the noble lord lord sandford has raised various points in regard to conservation <e> <s> we recognise that conservation is of very great importance as is good husbandry <e> <s> i pointed out at the time that matters raised in the amendments proposed then as in the amendments before the house now were of very great importance <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister realise that it is claimed that the american congressional record suggests that there is more than significant drug-taking among american servicemen generally <e> <s> is he not aware that recently six american servicemen were sent home <e> <s> while one recognises that drug-taking is not confined to one nationality in view of the fact that greenham common and other bases throughout the country are under american control is the minister satisfied with the safeguards in such a situation <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not consider that his reply to my supplementary question was not only brief but dismissive <e> <s> is he really unaware of the concern there must be among many people that some of those who will take responsibilities which are a matter of life and death for millions perhaps could be in a situation in which they are not really able to use the faculties that we would expect them to have <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister not reflect that his ability to say no when he meant yes is the reason why many of us have serious fears when the nuclear potential is involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the noble lord lord stanley in his amendment <e> <s> the noble lord made reference to the report stage of the bill when he said that the minister said in <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i briefly refer to his comment that he thought that this was rather a late stage to put in these changes <e> <s> perhaps i may draw the noble lords attention to the original state of the bill when it came before your lordships house <e> <s> in clause paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to say that we are pleased with the noble lords amendment and the flexibility which he has shown <e> <s> from time to time there have been criticisms of the various amendments to clause which we hope the minister will take into account <e> <s> while i am on my feet may i say that when speaking to amendment no <e> <s> earlier today i quoted remarks which i attributed in error to the noble earl lord onslow who was not then in the chamber <e> <s> those remarks should have been attributed to my noble friend lord john-mackie <e> <s> i apologise to the noble earl for attributing to him the comments which i made about the speech immediately following his which is reported in <e>", "<cs> my lords we support the amendment and are very pleased at the ministers response <e> <s> we raised the matter of smallholdings at an earlier stage and also pointed out the very considerable value that they have <e> <s> we hope that the minister will also take into account some of the other observations made during earlier stages before the bill goes to another place <e>", "<cs> my lords in the absence of dual-key control the government assure the house that the agreement made in mr attlees time still prevails with regard to the joint operation of the sites between the united states and united kingdom personnel <e> <s> can the noble earl assure the house that this situation is always updated in view of changing circumstances including those such as my noble friend has mentioned and also having regard to the increased lethality of the weapons which they operate <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that the comments of my noble friend lord beswick regarding the report of his statement in <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the minister for repeating the statement made in the other place <e> <s> we recognise that it could refer to what is an increasingly menacing situation <e> <s> the house will be relieved that despite substantial damage to the british-registered ship none of the crew was seriously hurt <e> <s> can the minister say why the owners were not in touch with the government about the attack on their vessel on st march <e> <s> we understand news came on th march and that they sought no assistance <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will he grateful for the ministers repetition of the statement which was made in another place and for enlarging on the progress made so far on the aspects which were envisaged in the defence white paper of on defence management and defence policy generally <e> <s> the house will recognise the importance of the statement but clearly it is one which will justify a much closer look later on and undoubtedly so during defence and other debates which will be coming in the next few months <e> <s> we recognise that with such substantial spending the figure of per cent <e> <s> has been mentioned as the increase between and it is essential to ensure maximum efficiency and economy <e> <s> other important aspects are those concerning defence procurement because the administration is only one small but necessarily vital part of defence spending <e>", "<cs> my lords have the questions and answers this afternoon not brought into focus the points that have been made on all sides of the house over recent months about the importance of land reform in the falklands <e> <s> is the minister aware that there is a monopoly situation in the falklands whereby one company alone owns about per cent <e> <s> of the land and indeed other facilities without which the operation and use of that land would be worth very little <e> <s> is he unaware of the facts that have been drawn to his attention by my noble friend lord shackleton that the falklands are there today because of the sacrifice of lives and the expenditure of considerable financial and other resources to win the war and that up to the present time about million has been expended quite rightly to defend the islands <e> <s> these are surely factors that should be taken into account <e> <s> will the noble lord remind the falkland islands <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the minister must appreciate the considerable disquiet in all parts of the house about this matter <e> <s> if the government have decided to have a runway in one area and the land is owned by a certain company how do they hope to ensure that only a reasonable price is paid for that land <e> <s> if the price offered by the government does not satisfy those who are the owners then the price they are asking would surely be far too high <e> <s> this is a monopoly situation not only in land but in other facilities as well <e> <s> surely the government should think very carefully before disregarding the views expressed so strongly by the house this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lords question not emphasise the importance of strict control of ammunition or weapons in nato countries regarding the export transport and particularly the monitoring of such weapons to see that they do not fall into the wrong hands <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> may i disarm him by saying that i am not speaking now as the defence spokesman but as a spokesman on ecclesiastical affairs having on entering your lordships house tried to avoid confusion by not taking the title of lord bishop <e> <s> is the minister really surprised that when he refers to matters of church and state the country as a whole should regard the under-secretary of states comments as being those of a member of the government <e> <s> would he also accept that the stricture that clergy should not involve themselves in politics could be seen as a restriction upon the role of the right reverend prelates and other clergy in this house in their task of conveying to the country the concern not only of the church but of the nation on matters of cardinal importance <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all very grateful to my noble friend lord jenkins of putney for again giving the house the opportunity of debating and considering the matters of grave importance which he has put before us <e> <s> although the title of this debate conjures up prospects of massive extermination my noble friend has given us a ray of hope with his claim that he thought that inevitability had not yet been reached although he thought that the holocaust was very close <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i stress the point that i made no remarks which were critical of the americans here <e> <s> the minister must know that the demand for dual key control which is a view held by the majority of people in this country is a way of ensuring that there is dual control in the most effective way <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness the minister say what form the consultations between ourselves and the united states take <e> <s> is it really a matter of being told what they have in mind rather than having earlier consultation <e> <s> also though one recognises the importance of adequate defence are there other treaties which may be breached such as the non-proliferation treaty and other agreements of that kind <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness recognise that the fact that she has been to the falkland islands and has had the benefit of meeting people there and seeing the position for herself has been generally welcomed <e> <s> does the noble baroness also recognise that the fortress falklands policy which might have been relevant for a short period is no longer justifiable because the future of the falkland islands depends upon their relationship with argentina with latin america and with other countries and that it also depends upon communications and trade <e> <s> can the noble baroness say what proposals have been received from president alfonsin what response the government have made and whether the government will initiate talks with the widest possible agenda in order to make progress <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful for the statement which is of course timely in view of changing trends and the greater sophistication of defence <e> <s> the minister has rightly referred to the weapons that will be in use <e> <s> the house will i am sure welcome in particular the significant increase in our conventional capability both in the united kingdom and germany and also in the credibility of our nato conventional deterrence <e> <s> we note the fact that the ta provides over a quarter of the armys mobilised strength at a cost of per cent <e> <s> of the armys budget <e> <s> can the minister say what will be the increase in numbers if there are to be by <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the allegations that chemical weapons have been used in the iraq-iran conflict the importance of the noble lords question is beyond doubt <e> <s> is the noble baroness aware that the united states too has recently sought consent to go ahead with the development of a new range of chemical weapons <e> <s> in view of these factors and apart from those mentioned by the noble lord <e> <s> lord boyd-carpenter will the government use their initiative to bring about an agreement at the earliest opportunity having regard also to the problems of verification <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that on th july last in this house my noble friend urged the government to have an independent inquiry into the circumstances of the sinking of the belgrano with the loss of lives <e> <s> in view of the continuing disquiet quite apart from the book which has been published and to which reference has been made do the government not consider that it would be helpful to their reputation to reconsider their decision on that day <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indebted to the noble lord lord airedale for adding his name to the list of those who from time to time have drawn the attention of your lordships house to the provisions of the easter act <e> <s> the argument that he advanced is one which has received the attention of this house for some years as a perusal of the <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government have come to a decision which they have yet to announce can they assure the house that
