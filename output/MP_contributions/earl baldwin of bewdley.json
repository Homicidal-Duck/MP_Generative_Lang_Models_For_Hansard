["<cs> my lords i am glad of the chance to take part in this debate in my maiden speech because i regard environmental pollution as one of the really big issues of our time and one which should claim the unbiased attention of all in authority everywhere <e>", "<cs> i agree entirely with what the noble baroness lady david and other speakers have said about the need to allow flexibility in the curriculum <e> <s> i shall not repeat the education arguments except to stress that there is a real danger of promising developments being stifled through a perceived need to keep within a legal framework <e> <s> the technical and vocational education initiative and the skills-based approach to learning are examples <e> <s> that <e>", "<cs> might it not help if clause said something on this <e> <s> that clause deals with the definitions and says <e>", "<cs> i want to look a little more deeply at the implications for parents and children of this clause which allows much freer access to schools <e> <s> up till now we have as the noble baroness lady david has made clear been governed by the act which was passed by a conservative administration <e> <s> i think it is worth looking at the wording of section of that act which reads <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the growing concern at the continued use of mercury in amalgam in dental fillings <e> <s> will he comment on the conclusion of the swedish health authorities that mercury in amalgam is a toxicologically unsuitable material <e>", "<cs> i must admit to a feeling of relief that we have come to that part of the bill which deals with the ilea not primarily because we are now moving to within sight of the finishing post but more because for almost the first time i believe it is possible to feel the firm rock of solid evidence under our feet <e>", "<cs> without knowing how long ago that was it is difficult for me to reply to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> however the difference is still an extremely large one <e> <s> the figure is one which was recently given to me and i have no reason to think that it is incorrect <e> <s> of course prices in the independent schools have gone up even in the past two years <e> <s> however be that as it may the difference is a great one <e> <s> it is the lea average of under which is perhaps the one which is out of step in this connection <e>", "<cs> my lords in speaking to this amendment i do not think that i can add anything new to the arguments that have already <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may throw in a point on core and foundation subjects which i suggested at committee stage <e> <s> i thought that the government would look at it and come back sympathetically <e> <s> it relates to the interpretation clause clause <e> <s> whatever is decided on the present amendments i feel that a word there would help to clarify the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to explain why i am less than enthusiastic about two amendments which on the face of it look quite reasonable and have attracted quite a wide measure of support <e> <s> we have heard a lot about examination syllabuses but i wish to look at the wording of the amendments <e> <s> there is a point of principle here which is in danger of being overlooked <e> <s> in curricular matters just as in disciplinary matters the head is in charge of what goes on in his or her own school answerable to the governors and within the broad framework of educational law <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to speak chiefly about one aspect of these amendments <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> provides in subsection e <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house that may be the noble earls experience but mine is rather different <e> <s> there are indeed some schools that play ball in that way but there are a large number that do not and that poses problems <e>", "<cs> my lords i have put my name to these amendments because as a local authority man who has had to wrestle with numbers and accommodation problems in schools i see clearly the dangers of tying intakes so inflexibly to school capacity in the way the bill seeks to bring about <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord peston has admirably covered the main point in arguing for continued lea involvement in appointing heads <e> <s> i can only confirm from my own experience the wisdom of what he said <e> <s> interviewing is a skilled and difficult business <e> <s> it is also one of the most important ingredients in the life of a school because the wellbeing of generations of children can depend upon it make no mistake about that <e>", "<cs> my lords uniformity in the teaching approach is not desirable but i think consistency in administrative questions such as this is a different matter <e> <s> in something as far-reaching and emotive as opting out one gets a sense of unfairness as has already been said for example if school a decided that each parent could have a separate vote while school b next-door perhaps with some of the same parents involved restricted it to one parent only <e> <s> i think we should all know where we stand before an operation of this type begins <e> <s> i am somewhat surprised that this otherwise most prescriptive bill should be silent on the matter <e> <s> in my view this amendment deserves support <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this amendment is no less important than amendment no <e> <s> with which we have dealt <e> <s> in fairness i think fairness is an important issue here no one should be able to vote for opting out who will not be around to bear the brunt of it or to reap the benefits whichever way one cares to look at it <e> <s> i do not believe that the experience of parents is the important issue here <e> <s> it would be nice if this provision could be more watertight and if the converse could be achieved by including those from primary schools who would be attending the school by the time it became grant-maintained <e> <s> but i think that one has to accept as the noble lord lord mcnair did in moving amendment no <e> <s> that this is fraught with legal difficulties and that a simple exclusion of those who are known to be leaving the school before opting out is the most practical way forward <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will agree with the reasoning behind this amendment and support it <e>", "<cs> my lords i was going to contribute to the debate even at the risk of repeating arguments which i advanced in committee <e> <s> many noble lords have spoken <e> <s> having listened to the speech of the noble and gallant lord lord bramall in particular i should like to associate myself with everything that he has said and what has been said by other noble lords in favour of these most sensible unprovocative amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords it is easy to see the hook that the government have got themselves on to in this matterthey are set on abolishing the ilea for reasons which are educationally unsound as some of us tried to make clear in committee <e> <s> out of the window with ilea will go a body of accumulated educational expertise <e> <s> people are already worried about the educational and other competence of some of the successor authorities <e> <s> this amendment is intended to reassure them <e> <s> what is the thinking behind it <e> <s> it is that mother knows best <e> <s> is this the th new power that the secretary of state is taking to himself or the th or th <e> <s> i have lost count <e>", "<cs> my lords i too shall not detain the house for long but i must detain noble lords for a moment <e> <s> clause is one of the most worrying parts of the bill as well as one of the most important <e> <s> it is of course a constitutional issue rather than an educational one <e> <s> indeed i spoke about it under an earlier amendment so i shall simply repeat the principle i quoted then <e> <s> i said that <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the infamous clause which gives the secretary of state powers far beyond anything that he might need to achieve the results on which on the whole we are all agreed <e> <s> we have hunted it through its various name changes from clause to to and we are still on the scent <e>", "<cs> my lords as i thought we have a gulf which is unbridgeable <e> <s> this chapter of the bill is a recipe for bureaucracy but i recognise <e>", "<cs> my lords it is an important amendment in the light of the present governments tendency to prefer people of the same point of view in positions of authority <e> <s> it is not good for government and it is quite inappropriate in professional posts of the kind we are considering <e> <s> we were not really reassured by the minister at report stage <e> <s> unless we are reassured i can think of many people i have worked with who would probably get nowhere with an application to an inner london council assuming that they were ever moved to apply <e> <s> indeed whole authorities could be tarred with the same brush on account of a general political background <e>", "<cs> my lords of course one wishes the bill well <e> <s> it would he ungracious to hope that it has all the effects on children s education that one has tried to warn against <e> <s> there will be some good results to set against the bad ones there is no doubt about it <e> <s> not everything about a defined curriculum is to be deplored <e> <s> local financial management is desirable in principle <e> <s> there will be good employment prospects for administrators especially at the des <e>", "<cs> my lords when the secretary of state argues that proposals for a school opting out are among the most important events in the history of that school and that it would be absurd to imagine that they could go through under cover of darkness so to speak without everyone locally being aware of the issues i think he is right <e> <s> i do not believe that this is a major problem <e> <s> those who still have worries on that score will of course be reassured by what was put forward last week in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble baroness lady nicol who is sadly not with us today opened the debate on this theme in your lordships house this time last year she began with the royal commissions definition of pollution <e> <s> the definition was as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope i may be forgiven if i slip away a few minutes before the end of the debate if that is the way the time goes <e> <s> otherwise i shall not get home tonight <e> <s> i am not a scientist and i do not operate a vdu <e> <s> my reason for taking part in this debate is that i have some acquaintance with the nature of allergic reactions referred to in the report <e> <s> i wish to add some thoughts to the evidence that has been gathered by the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to look at a different aspect of quality and safety in food production from that which is in the spotlight not because i am unconcerned about the incidence of food poisoning if that is the right term far from it <e> <s> the last time i suffered from it was an occasion i shall not forget and i profoundly hope it will never happen again <e> <s> the effects are horrible but in the vast majority of cases they are short term <e> <s> you know you have been hit <e> <s> there is a violent reaction and the human body has its mechanisms for getting rid of the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble lord lord reay for initiating the debate <e> <s> i am especially grateful for the way in which he chose to word the motion <e> <s> in the context of the full range of methods for dealing with crimes of violence i should like to draw attention to just one area of research to which i alluded briefly in the debate on food quality and safety on st march <e> <s> i believe that the home office is aware of this kind of research and i should be most interested to hear the ministers view upon it when he speaks at the end of the debate <e>", "<cs> i believe that i am not alone in viewing this amendment with serious misgivings <e> <s> i believe that any measure which makes the fluoridation of further water supplies more likely should be resisted <e> <s> this amendment would have that effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment because i believe the time is coming as it has come in other countries when there will be a reappraisal of the effects of fluoride in drinking water <e> <s> the subject i can assure the noble lord lord brougham and vaux will not go away <e>", "<cs> my lords we have before us a bill which has been awaited for a long time <e> <s> there is no doubt that there are some good measures in it <e> <s> the registration of premises is a step in the right direction <e> <s> whether it is a step far enough will doubtless be debated at a later stage <e> <s> measures to make suppliers accountable for the safety of the food which they sell are much to be welcomed <e> <s> powers of enforcement are provided for and it is a relief not to say a turn-up for the books to find an acknowledgement by the government that there will be costs falling on local authorities which need to be taken account of <e> <s> the move towards proper training for the handlers of food can only be good <e>", "<cs> my lords shortly before i came into the chamber this afternoon i misread the annunciator to say prayers for the future of the nhs <e> <s> for a moment i thought quite seriously of scrapping my speech in favour of what might have been a more effective solution <e>", "<cs> this is an amendment of no great substance but it would plug a possible loophole which the noble viscount described <e> <s> we believe that it would be anomalous if a seller of food was able to mislead by means of a picture and so escape the penalty which the clause provides in other cases <e> <s> i hope that the government will have no difficulty with the amendment <e>", "<cs> in addition to what has been said there are other valid points that need to be made in support of the noble viscount <e> <s> the labelling situation in this country is unsatisfactory <e> <s> the public are confused at the lack of standardisation <e> <s> they want to follow recommended guidelines for healthy eating for the prevention of <e>", "<cs> so far as concerns alcoholic beverages in my view it is just as important that they should be labelled as anything else that we eat or drink <e> <s> as has already been pointed out it is a handicap to people who react adversely to drinks not to be able to tell whether their problem <e>", "<cs> the question of irradiation of food is probably the most contentious issue in this area at present <e> <s> there is a huge amount of unease about it among the public as well as an accumulated distrust of official assurances over a wide range of environmental subjects <e> <s> for that reason it is only right that there should be full discussion of the pros and cons during the passage of the bill <e> <s> that among other things is what the amendment sets out to achieve <e>", "<cs> i intervene to correct one misapprehension <e> <s> i do not think that we are looking for absolute assurances <e> <s> i for one accept that in science such things are unavailable <e> <s> it is just that we do not believe that the evidence for safety so far is quite good enough <e>", "<cs> i shall answer the ministers last point first by pointing out that milk and wheat are part of our staple diet whereas one has much more of a choice about putting in additives <e> <s> to add something to which people are known to react does not seem to me to be good sense <e>", "<cs> the consumer is central to the whole bill he is to be protected from bad food he is to be offered irradiation although he says that he does not want it but is he to be consulted on any of those measures <e> <s> i am sure that the minister will say of course but the governments idea of consumer involvement is sometimes a pretty measly affair <e> <s> if the government wish to be seen to be on the publics side they have a large credibility problem at present a good way would be to write consumer consultation on the face of the bill <e> <s> those interests likely to be substantially affected by the regulations are sure to include the big battalions and it is right that they should <e> <s> many of us would feel a great deal more confident about the interests of the public if the amendment were accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble viscount lord falkland and the noble lord lord colwyn i thought that we had a somewhat truncated debate on irradiation in committee on the food safety bill since it was pointed out there that there would be an opportunity to go into the arguments more fully when we discussed the select committees report <e> <s> now we find that we are compressed into the dinner hour which is not the ideal time for a subject of such wide-ranging interest <e> <s> we may be similarly constricted during the one-day report stage of the bill <e> <s> nevertheless i shall not take any more time than i have to <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment proposed would ensure that food safety was looked at from a broader perspective and that it was not just the big battalions that were listened to when things went wrong <e> <s> in my view the position of the consumer has always been important <e> <s> it is not at all clear that the consumer panel as envisaged at present would have any real power <e> <s> consumers need to be represented on the main body where the major recommendations are made so that their views can carry at least as much weight as those of everyone else <e> <s> if that does not happen then i fear that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the limited support that i have received from the benches opposite although obviously it did not go as far as i would have liked <e> <s> the noble baroness lady gardner talked about the needs of the third world <e> <s> there may well be a case there for food spoilage but i myself object to being a guinea-pig in respect of what happens in the third world <e> <s> if they want it there by all means let them use it but in my view we are arguing about this country and about what we do to our own people <e> <s> that is a different point <e> <s> the noble baroness lady carnegy said that if i was alarmed by it i should say so <e> <s> i thought i had been saying so rather like a gramophone record for three of four weeks <e> <s> my point was that not enough work had been done and that one was right to be alarmed about these things until the safety issues had been tidied up <e> <s> we should not undertake research as we go along as the noble baroness suggested but should do it beforehand and get it right first <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord lord hailsham has spoken as he spoke before and i am afraid that i am going to speak as i spoke before since this is the last chance for your lordships house to look at food irradiation <e> <s> i should like briefly to run through the arguments against proceeding with this process with undue haste <e> <s> i shall do no more than list them since they were developed at earlier stages of the bill <e> <s> it is however important to do so <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister but before he sits down perhaps i may say that i did not quite catch the last point <e> <s> was it that if students qualify as they will for mandatory awards in the private sector they will be eligible for loans <e> <s> is it as simple as that <e>", "<cs> i think i understood that <e> <s> obviously i shall not press the amendment <e> <s> it was merely a probing amendment in order to obtain information <e> <s> i shall carefully read what the noble earl said <e> <s> i am grateful for the clarification and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> complementary medicine is growing fast in popularity and usage and now represents a substantial slice of health care in this country <e> <s> more than four years ago the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for the wide-ranging participation and support of so many of your lordships this evening <e> <s> at the risk of seeming invidious i wish to echo the words of the noble lord lord ennals and say how particularly glad i was that my noble friend lord hunter took the time to participate in the debate <e> <s> he has been very busy with the national health service bill but we appreciate the fact that he took time to contribute to the debate from his rather more mainstream stance <e> <s> i should like to go into the question of diagnosis which the noble lord invited me to discuss <e> <s> however i do not think we have the time to do so this evening <e> <s> it would not be an easy answer because again the therapies have their different ways of looking at things <e> <s> an acupuncturist would have a completely different scheme of diagnosis from many other people <e> <s> the healers for example specifically set their face against diagnosis <e> <s> they say that that is a job for the doctors <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for the support that i have had from all sides of the house <e> <s> i could not have asked for more nor indeed have expected more than i have had unanimously from all except the noble baroness <e> <s> obviously i had been hoping for some accommodation from her on this matter <e> <s> sadly it has not come <e> <s> we have simply had a repeat of the arguments advanced last time with the issue of clinical responsibility thrown in which would not be a problem under the wording of our amendment <e> <s> believing as i do that this is an important issue as i believe do your lordships there is nothing left but to test the opinion of the house <e>"]
