["<cs> my lords we have had a most interesting and perhaps important debate on a subject which must be of national importance <e> <s> i have been delighted at the bipartisan atmosphere that has prevailed in all parts of the house and has been reflected in the speeches indeed it has also been enhanced by the speeches of two ex-ministers for the arts <e> <s> the noble lord lord mowbray and stourton has very fully replied to and covered the speeches made by noble lords but i should like to make one or two comments <e> <s> i should like to say how much i agree with my noble friend lord eccles about the importance of local involvement and i am sure that this is a matter in which area museums councils can do much more to help co-ordinate and advise <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that over a year ago the previous spokesman in this house promised that the report would be published very shortly <e> <s> is he further aware that there will be great frustration in hampshire about the growing congestion and also much more seriously about fatal accidents on the existing road until a decision is made on the m <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that this bottleneck has been a problem for many years and is quite separate from the extension of the motorway <e> <s> in the meantime could my noble friend also look into the possibility of a better phasing of the lights while this work is being done <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend recognise that there are many travel agents who are facing serious financial problems at present and that the operations of these bucket shops seriously damage their prospects <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> his answer will be carefully studied by those concerned and with the leave of the committee i should like to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord bear in mind that the tourist industry the hotel and catering industry and many others concerned with consumer manufacturing would warmly welcome a fixed easter <e> <s> a varied easter is doing considerable harm to their trade from time to time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper but in asking it i wish to declare my interest as president of the english vineyards association <e>", "<cs> my lords while i reluctantly accept the governments difficulties in regard to tax may i ask my noble friend whether he would agree that it is grossly unfair to genuine english wine producers and misleading to the general public that they should allow a situation to continue whereby producers of british wine do not have to conform to eec regulations in regard to labelling or indeed to our own trade description acts <e> <s> would my noble friend further agree that the only british content in so-called british wine is british water <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble earl for that encouraging reply <e> <s> may i ask him whether one can assume that any regulations laid down will be under the construction and use regulations <e> <s> before that is done will the widest possible consultation be carried out and investigations made into the new materials which are being used very successfully in other countries to suppress spray <e>", "<cs> my lords before i speak to the bill i should like to add my personal congratulations to the noble lord lord geoffrey-lloyd <e> <s> he could hardly have chosen a better subject to talk about as his success in administering leeds castle has excited the admiration of many in the heritage business many of whom follow the same principles as he has been enunciating <e> <s> i hope that he will play an active part in the committee stage and continue to let us have his advice <e> <s> secondly i should like to apologise to the noble earl lord avon and to all members of the house because due to a long standing engagement outside london later this afternoon i am unable to stay for the rest of the debate <e>", "<cs> in view of the very interesting hint given by the noble earl lord avon about his attitude to amendment no <e> <s> and also i hope to nos <e> <s> and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i should like also to say how very much i agree with the noble lord lord donaldson that this list was drawn up after tremendous consultation by the senior staff at the v and a i hope that in appointing trustees these ideas will be taken on board because if it is what the senior curatorial staff think <e> <s> i think they have a good case <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i draw the attention of the committee to page of the bill <e> <s> membership of the heritage commission is laid down in paragraph <e> <s> the phrase used there is shall have regard to the desirability of the persons having knowledge or experience of one or more of the following <e> <s> a list then follows <e> <s> i strongly support my noble friends amendment <e>", "<cs> i strongly support this amendment <e> <s> i believe that with the newly devolved status of the museums it is absolutely essential for the trustees to be active to attend meetings and to be fully aware of what is going on <e> <s> in the case of sickness of course the boards approval can be obtained <e> <s> with the modern type of trustee that we have been talking about <e>", "<cs> i think i must support this amendment <e> <s> the only possible disadvantage is that somebody who was in prospect of a very good career would have to balance whether he would take up the job for seven years rather than carry on in his present position <e> <s> however i think that perhaps the person should have confidence in himself take on the job and make a good job of it <e> <s> unless he is going to do that he is not the right person to appoint anyway <e> <s> although it is a balance i am inclined to support the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may also speak to this amendment in view of the fact that amendments nos <e> <s> and in my name are basically along the same lines <e> <s> my amendments are based on giving the directors of the v and a and the science museum the same powers as are given in the british museum act to the british museum director this includes the care of all property covering therefore historic buildings and objects held outside the main premises of the museums <e> <s> it also emphasises perhaps the curatorial responsibilities of the two museum directors <e> <s> but obviously it is important to try to define the responsibilities of the director towards the trustees <e>", "<cs> there seem to be two different points here <e> <s> as president of the museums association <e> <s> i must speak for the existing staff and say that i am sure they would expect and deserve to have the same terms and conditions as they have at the moment <e> <s> so far as i can see that is very clearly laid down in paragraph of the schedule <e> <s> i do not see how one can expect anything more <e>", "<cs> i am somewhat disappointed because i am not aware that the british museum in the past years has found any problems <e> <s> but if the amendment has been wrongly drafted in any way i will certainly look at it again <e> <s> however in my view it should be parliaments job to lay down the quorum procedures for trustees <e> <s> i do not believe that in the end it should be left to the trustees to set them for themselves <e> <s> that is my main point <e> <s> i ask the noble earl to look at the matter again to see whether it has been wrongly drafted and if so perhaps we can draft something that will satisfy the committee because i believe that i have the support of many noble lords on both sides on this particular point <e>", "<cs> in view of that i am happy to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in view of what the noble earl has just said i am happy to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> most certainly <e> <s> but my noble friend has just said that the bill lays down regional and provincial responsibilities and i cannot see where that is in the bill <e> <s> my noble friend has <e>", "<cs> in view of the assurance that the noble earl had given on this particular matter i am very pleased to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my only quarrel with the amendment is that it is too restricting <e> <s> i do not see why moneys should be kept just for acquisitions <e> <s> i refer the noble lord to amendment no <e> <s> which is to be moved soon and which gives a much wider interpretation <e> <s> i hope that the committee will look at that before restricting moneys for admission and other such activities only to acquisitions <e>", "<cs> in supporting the noble baroness lady airey in this amendment i should report that there is considerable concern in the museum world over clause in dealing with the <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> that amendment is to leave out the word and in order to achieve the next amendment which follows on grammatically <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should be very happy to bow to the superior drafting of the noble earls <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend <e> <s> in view of that satisfactory statement we look forward to the government amendment <e> <s> i am therefore happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we have had quite an interesting discussion on this point <e> <s> i moved this amendment in order to bring consistency into the whole matter <e> <s> regardless of what the department of the environment thinks i know that the staff of the armouries feel very strongly that they would like the trustees to be appointed by the prime minister <e> <s> they believe they may wrongly believe that they are in some way being slighted and demoted as a result <e> <s> i hope that the government will be able to accept this amendment but if not one could perhaps think of a compromise at the report stage whereby the chairman is appointed by the prime minister and the other trustees are appointed by the secretary of state <e> <s> i just make that suggestion which might appeal to the government <e> <s> i think that there is considerable support in the committee for this point and i hope that my noble friend may be able to meet me on it <e>", "<cs> i must apologise for not having moved the amendment which was consequential on this amendment but i should like to support the noble baroness lady birk and say again that i think that the inconsistency is unfortunate <e> <s> it would be much better if the armouries were funded directly from parliament and not from the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> in view of that very satisfactory reply by the noble earl i am very happy to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble earls statement was very interesting and useful <e> <s> i am sure that the trustees will read his remarks with great interest <e> <s> however the complication which he has described is a very good reason for doing something about it <e> <s> having heard what has been said perhaps the trustees will now take some action to resolve the matter <e> <s> there can be no doubt that it is a complicated and unsatisfactory situation for one of our really important museums <e> <s> otherwise i withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> there is no doubt that the present name in the bill is a terrible mouthful and i am sure something simpler is essential <e> <s> it is unfortunate in some ways that we are using that rather overworked word heritage but i am afraid it is very difficult to find anything else and the public at large does begin to know what it means <e> <s> i very much hope that the government will consider some shorter title and if the drafting is wrong perhaps it can be put right at report stage <e> <s> i do hope something simpler will be found than the title in the bill at the moment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment of the noble baroness lady birk but after hearing my noble friend lord avon i believe that he has now moved more in our direction <e> <s> given the enormous scope of the new commissions activities in respect of the historic buildings council and so on it must not be forgotten that there will be enormous demands on the commission and the commissioners <e> <s> there will also be new elements particularly on the commercial side tourism and education and these must be satisfied within the commission <e> <s> i think there must be a great advance on the figure of members and if my noble friend will bring forward an amendment for this number i will be delighted to support it <e>", "<cs> as my name is down to this amendment which we welcome very much as a principle which was not included in respect of the museums we discussed earlier perhaps i may say that while the list is not correct with a little more thought it could be made excellent and it is to be hoped that the ideas contained in these amendments can be incorporated <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> it has been the experience particularly of new bodies set up that this has always been a <e>", "<cs> somewhere in the bill there is a note that there will be fewer civil servants around when the bill comes into force <e> <s> i think that the civil servants who are now being discussed are <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment it is very important that the commission should get the experience of listing as soon as possible because in the long run it is a job which they should do in order to take them out of the political arena <e> <s> but it is very important not to interrupt the listing which is going on at the moment and which has been speeded up thanks to more staff being put on to the job by the secretary of state as he announced months ago <e> <s> it is important that the commission should take the listing under their wing as soon as possible and if it can be done through delegation so much the better <e>", "<cs> i too strongly support the amendment <e> <s> needless to say there is a certain amount of apprehension among those who are concerned with the heritage about the form that this new commission will take <e> <s> one way in which we could allay their fears is to use the word shall rather than may because during this transitional period while the commission is finding its feet the best possible way in which it can step into the future with the confidence of all concerned and carry on the good work of this historic buildings council and the ancient monuments board is for it to feel that such committees will exist <e> <s> although i am sure it is the clear intention of the secretary of state that these committees will be set up it would be much better so far as the bill is concerned if this were to be mandatory rather than permissive <e>", "<cs> the noble earl must surely know that there is considerable disquiet in archaeological circles about the problem of rescue archaeology <e> <s> although the government and previous governments have sometimes quite generously given money for rescue archaeology when new motorways and so on have been built one of the chronic problems has been that no money has ever been provided to display those objects once the rescue archaeology has taken place <e> <s> so it is important that the archaeologists are now looking towards the commission as being a strong and responsible body through whom rescue archaeology can be carried out and recorded <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl very much indeed <e> <s> in view of his confirmation that he will look at this again i shall be happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl very much <e> <s> i am happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to hear that response from the noble earl and i have great pleasure in withdrawing the amendment at this stage <e>", "<cs> no i was referring to no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> i think the difficulty of understanding schedule particularly paragraphs and has caused problems but if the position is made clearer at a later stage of the bill we shall all be satisfied <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in view of the confirmation from the noble earl that he will look at this point i shall be happy to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i believe that many people in this country feel very strongly about the question of craftsmen and indeed the use of traditional materials on which conservation relies <e> <s> the noble lord lord kennet says that it would be splendid if the commission could take the initiative and itself start training courses <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> i feel that there will be tremendous opportunities in the future for people to leave property money and even objects to the commission for its care as an alternative or complementary to those who have left such things to the national trust and so on <e> <s> there may be other ways of using such charitable trust funds but it is certainly a situation where one wants to give confidence to the general public to take the heritage seriously and to feel that the commission will be the right repository for anything they wish to provide <e>", "<cs> the noble earl has already given the committee quite a number of assurances about clause <e> <s> in view of that i am happy to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> do i understand that in principle the commission will in fact be able to engage in trade and that there will be a vehicle through which such trade can take place <e>", "<cs> in view of that assurance i shall be happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not really see the point of this amendment <e> <s> it does not seem to take the commission any further <e> <s> surely the commission will have within its ranks we hope and also on its advisory committees which it will be setting up all the expertise that it will need <e> <s> the secretary of state has already made known that he wishes to consult with the commission whenever he has a problem <e> <s> i do not see why one has to have yet another advisory council <e> <s> it will make bureaucracy even worse <e> <s> as someone has just said let the commissioners get on with it and let them appoint the committees they need <e> <s> i am sure that all the expertise will be there <e> <s> but to have yet another advisory council will make bureaucracy far worse <e> <s> i do not think there need be too much fear about this <e> <s> i think we could leave it to the commission to run its own affairs and to give the right advice to the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> this matter was raised during the second reading debate <e> <s> this scheme was very successfully evolved by the national trust for scotland some years ago <e> <s> there they call it a revolving fund but it is the same idea <e> <s> there is no doubt that on many occasions the commission will be able to act as a wonderful catalyst to bring together a lot of interested parties so that this sort of conservation work can be done <e> <s> if the commission do not have these powers in the bill i hope that they will be given them <e>", "<cs> as the commissions work develops in the way in which we all hope that it will and grows in stature more and more people i am sure will look towards it to carry out schemes which at the moment are not carried out at all <e> <s> chatham dockyard is a good example although a special trust may be set up there <e> <s> it is important that powers should be given to the commission to have the widest possible area of responsibility for the heritage as a whole <e>", "<cs> i support everything that has been said by the noble baroness lady birk and should like to make one other point <e> <s> in the struggle to keep up our great estates which has been continuing for many years and which involves many members of this house one of the most important things is the forward planning for those estates <e> <s> in preparing a comprehensive conservation plan for the whole estate it is very much better to know which land is to be exempt <e> <s> there was a time when the treasury made it possible to get advice of this kind but unfortunately because of shortage of staff such advice has not been so available recently if such advice will be available from the commission in future it should enhance the possibility of the countryside being conserved in a very much better way and of the owners co-operating in this <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> i remember some years ago discussing this matter with a senior civil servant from the department of the environment <e> <s> he said it was impossible to do and there was no way of doing it <e> <s> i thought at the time that this was a needlessly reactionary view to take <e> <s> the fact is that it can be done <e> <s> the noble lord will be interested to know that his neighbouring county of hampshire is doing this at the moment <e> <s> in fact i was speaking only today to one of the planning officers and gardens are being listed at the moment in hampshire <e> <s> how they are doing it i do not know but it can be done <e> <s> if one county can do it other people can do it <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment in some degree <e> <s> the noble earl will remember that exactly two years ago i presented a report to the secretary of state in my capacity as chairman of the working group on the alternative use of historic buildings and that report went into the subject of psa buildings railways and so on in some detail <e> <s> one of our recommendations was that the psa should start listing its own buildings <e> <s> therefore i was delighted recently to see that the first volume of its publication has come out dealing with the buildings in its care in the north of england <e> <s> it is a very fine publication which will i gather be followed by others covering the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i too think that this amendment has gone too far <e> <s> i think the house will agree that the most important thing is that trustees should be the very best people who can be found to run these great institutions <e> <s> once one starts having appointments representative of various bodies one is definitely restricted and as the noble lord has just said i do not think that the colour of the skin or <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like generally to support the amendment <e> <s> i think that everybody in your lordships house has been trying to get away from the great and the good type of appointment which will inevitably go on <e> <s> there is now some indication that even though one may be great and good one might have other qualifications as well <e> <s> so although the proposal may not be enforceable i believe that in years to come somebody might wish to pack the board of trustees with political appointments with people who have no knowledge whatever of the subject of the museum and so it may be desirable to mention in the legislation the point covered in the amendments <e> <s> that is why i definitely support them and i am very glad that the government have brought them forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i am rather surprised at this amendment because as president of the museums association i took it as my duty to consult the civil service unions and certainly they made no mention of this worry to me <e> <s> i feel that perhaps the noble lord lord jenkins has been misled by an extremely misleading leaflet which was put out without any authority by people calling themselves the staff of the museums <e> <s> the directors of both museums do not know who these people are and the leaflet was not signed <e> <s> if it really is a question of civil service pride in future we want people in museums who have pride in the profession of being a museum person and not just an ex-police officer or an ex-civil servant <e> <s> it is the professionalism of museum attendants and their training which is going to count and not the fact that they might be civil servants <e>", "<cs> my lords as the member of your lordships house who raised these matters in committee i should like to thank my noble friend for meeting us on this occasion and for introducing the amendments which i am sure will cover the position which i outlined <e>", "<cs> my lords in supporting the amendment there is one more point to make the desire at all times in the future to have the very best trustees <e> <s> times are changing fast <e> <s> trustees are not going to be the same trustees as they have been in the past <e> <s> if they are paid it will give them a moral obligation to turn up at trustees meetings and do a proper job <e> <s> if they do not wish to take their money they do not have to and if they did not choose to do so i am sure the treasury would be delighted <e> <s> in future there will be a strong obligation on trustees to consider their job to be important <e> <s> to pay them would give them an extra moral obligation to do their duty properly <e>", "<cs> my lords before we leave the subject entirely i notice one important difference between these two amendments and that is that with regard to the victoria and albert the national art library is used a a source of public reference whereas the science museum does not seem to have that attached <e> <s> i think it is well known that the science museum library fine as it is is basically for the use of its own museum staff <e> <s> i wonder whether it might be considered that it should be used more openly by the public than it is at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that answer <e> <s> i am sure we shall be relieved to hear that there is no bar to objects being transferred to provincial museums <e> <s> the noble earl will remember that at committee stage i had an amendment down about the provincial responsibilities of the v and a and the science museum <e> <s> i do not know whether this is an opportunity to ask the noble earl to confirm that those responsibilities are envisaged by the government to continue <e> <s> the provincial museums have felt a great debt in the past for the leadership and advice given by these two great institutions <e> <s> it is important that this should continue <e> <s> but if the noble earl could make it absolutely certain that there is no legal bar to these transfers taking place i believe the provincial museums will be forever in his debt <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i would support the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge on this amendment <e> <s> this amendment gave the noble lord lord jenkins the opportunity to express a widespread opinion held by certain people <e> <s> he said that a lot of people thought that britain was dragging its feet <e> <s> a lot of people in the museum world are delighted that they are doing so <e> <s> i believe it would be quite wrong that this should be in this bill <e> <s> certainly it would be wrong to single out the victoria and albert museum of all museums to have these powers <e>", "<cs> my lords in supporting this amendment may i say that it may be recalled that on committee stage we had a division about this amendment <e> <s> as a compromise the point that the noble baroness lady birk <e> <s> has raised was suggested that even if the secretary of state continues to appoint the trustees perhaps the chairman should be appointed by the prime minister <e> <s> it may seem that the armouries are taking unnecessary umbrage and feeling that they are being put on a lower status <e> <s> that is a matter of opinion <e> <s> nevertheless they feel this and one has to take into consideration their feelings <e> <s> certainly in view of the fact that the armouries have an important place in this bill it appears rather strange that they are treated so differently <e> <s> i hope that the appointment of the chairman by the prime minister can he accepted even if the secretary of state continues to appoint the other trustees <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for moving this amendment <e> <s> it certainly covers the points that i raised on committee and will ensure that the connection between the armouries and the tower of london will last as it should last <e>", "<cs> my lords we had a discussion on this at committee stage and i think it was generally agreed that the present title is rather long and clumsy <e> <s> it is also generally agreed by many people inside and outside your lordships house that the word heritage is a very over-worked word at the moment <e> <s> nevertheless the fact that nobody likes it at the moment does not mean that it will not become even more respectable as the years go on <e> <s> indeed perhaps the commission will make it more respectable apart from anything else so i hope that some further thought will be given to this because it is a great mouthful and it is going to he abbreviated anyway <e> <s> i think we may as well try to encourage people to use an expression which is sensible <e>", "<cs> my lords as one of the members of your lordships house who raised this matter in committee i should like to thank the noble earl for his most satisfactory statement <e> <s> it is one which i warmly welcome <e> <s> i am sure that the comparison which has been made with the national heritage memorial fund is a very good one because that is working so well <e> <s> another very good reason is that it is most important for the public to have confidence that the new commission is working for the national benefit as a whole and that no tax of any sort which would simply go round in circles will have to be paid <e> <s> therefore i warmly welcome the noble earls statement and i am sure that the whole house will welcome it too <e>", "<cs> my lords in supporting this amendment i should like to say as one who supports the concept of the new heritage or historic buildings commission that there is a certain amount of apprehension among those two bodies the ancient monuments board and the historic buildings council which have done so much marvellous work over so many years <e> <s> not only that there is the public confidence in them and all the people who have benefited from their advice and help <e> <s> it would be unthinkable for the new commission not to set up these committees but nevertheless it would be excellent if this could be put in the bill because it would give a tremendous amount of confidence to anybody that this new commission was going to work in the way that it wants to <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl and i am now certainly much more satisfied <e> <s> having received those assurances which will certainly make good reading in <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to disappoint the noble baroness when i say that i really do support the governments view on this amendment <e> <s> those of us who have been concerned with the conservation of the heritage for many years know that it is perfectly possible to have good conservation and public enjoyment running hand in hand <e> <s> indeed in the private sector it is the public enjoyment which usually produces all the funds the initiative and the incentive to carry out good conservation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that what the noble lord lord adeane has said will be of great interest to the many people concerned <e> <s> they are worried that unless the information is available and reasonably quickly available the commission will he forced out of necessity to set up its own records <e> <s> that would be a terrible duplication which should certainly be avoided <e> <s> it is the availability of the record which is most important to the commission rather than the actual recording of it themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can help my noble friend having been associated with both conservation and preservation for many years <e> <s> i believe that in amenity circles <e> <s> conservation entails a great deal more constructive attitude than preservation conservation can be on-going and can entail all sorts of matters which preservation does not <e> <s> this may be nitpicking but that is how these words are beginning to change in their meaning in the english language <e> <s> we all much more prefer conservation to preservation which can have a rather static and dead feeling to it <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no doubt that the plight of the smaller houses is <e>", "<cs> my lords in thinking about this subject will the noble earl consider the possibility of putting in somewhere the word interpretation because that covers everything that we are talking about <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that that is a most helpful statement and it certainly contains some very interesting information which i am sure the house will be very pleased to hear indeed <e> <s> it may save some time later on this evening <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend lord strathcona will agree with me in thinking that we should withdraw the amendment in view of the assurances that we have had from my noble friend lord avon <e>", "<cs> my lords in supporting the amendment i do not think it is any secret that there was considerable heart searching by the government as to whether royal palaces should be included <e> <s> as the bill progresses it is becoming more and more <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of that assurance and i am delighted to hear once again that it confirmed that the commission will be able to operate revolving funds i am happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords although some of us are disappointed that the government cannot accept this amendment i certainly recognise that they have gone some way towards meeting the points <e> <s> there is no doubt that the psa has at times done a very good job however in the past it has not always done so and one does not always know what will happen in future <e> <s> i should have thought that the psa would warmly welcome close connections with the new commission and if that is to be encouraged so much the better <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord must surely be aware of the intense feeling about this in garden circles <e> <s> although i appreciate the technical problems about the word listing and the comparison with buildings there is an urgent need for a proper register a sort of domesday book of gardens to be compiled before many more are lost because unlike a building a garden can disappear extremely quickly if neglected <e> <s> i hope that something can be done along these lines <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the point that the noble earl has made as he made it on other amendments this evening <e> <s> i take the point that obviously a close relationship between the chairman of the new commission and the secretary of state may well be the best solution of all <e> <s> perhaps therefore it will be appropriate for me to withdraw this amendment at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has perhaps reassured me but i am sure he appreciates the reason why i put down the amendment <e> <s> it would be most unsatisfactory if one had a dichotomy between the department of the environment and the new commission over many properties <e> <s> however in view of the assurance which i have just heard i am happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i am in the position of supporting this amendment <e> <s> i think it is generally known by many people concerned with this bill that this is the hottest potato of all <e> <s> i think it is a pity somebody has to be prepared to pick it up and i understand they do not want to get their fingers burned <e> <s> the fact is that this problem is not going to go away and what i find very difficult to understand is why the royal commission whose work we very much admire and whose chairman in the chamber has been of tremendous help to us in this debate is not prepared even to discuss the matter <e> <s> what are they afraid of i ask <e> <s> what are they trying to hide <e> <s> is there some reason why discussion cannot go on as to the <e>", "<cs> my lords with that encouraging reply to an important point i am happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i find this a completely staggering amendment <e> <s> perhaps it is light relief at the end of a very long debate <e> <s> it was my impression that our national museums belonged to the nation and were run for the nation by the staff <e> <s> it appears from the amendment of the noble lord lord jenkins that they are owned by the staff who have to be consulted about every move that goes on <e> <s> perhaps the new security guard who comes in the day before the ballot is taken will know a great deal more about running museums than the director and his senior staff who have all expressed the opinion that they would like these changes to he made <e> <s> it really is so absurd that i am very surprised that it can be moved seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords in supporting the amendment <e> <s> i think the house knows that a great deal of thought has been given to a more convenient name <e> <s> i hope that perhaps what has been suggested now is the best compromise <e> <s> the one thing i like about it is the fact that the famous historic buildings council which we all know has the initials hbc and the new commission will have similar initials hbmc <e> <s> however having said that i hope the house will now agree that this is a much more convenient title <e> <s> i hope the government will see their way to accepting this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in supporting this amendment although it might appear to noble lords that this is rather a nit-picking point i certainly can confirm after many years in the world of amenity societies that the two words are now attracting very different meanings certainly some people in amenity societies cannot bear to use the word preservation <e> <s> conservation was their cry <e> <s> this implies a view which is much more constructive whereas preservation implies the <e>", "<cs> my lords i warmly welcome this amendment <e> <s> as someone who has been involved in showing houses to the public for years i can assure your lordships that a souvenir and a good cup of tea are very much a part of a day out and it is the day out that the new commission will be selling to the british public <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to say at the outset how delighted i was to hear at long last a firm statement from the government on this matter <e> <s> if the previous amendments have in some way implied a sentence of death on the royal commission i would only say that that has certainly concentrated their minds and i think that has been an extremely good exercise <e> <s> the excellent statement by the noble lord lord adeane will go a long way to satisfy many people who have been worried about the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords that is certainly a slightly grudging reply <e> <s> however i am sure that there is some joy in the house that this amendment may get accepted <e> <s> some of us feel very strongly that despite the fact that it may be in the bill it is not terribly clear that it is <e> <s> there is no doubt that a vegetable garden would be of enormous benefit to future generations and also to those concerned in the future with the administration of the heritage and planning in this country <e> <s> i do not think i need say any more about the importance of gardens <e> <s> it has long been the ambition of members of the historic houses association many of whom own great gardens to see that their gardens are treated with the same respect as are their houses <e> <s> i hope that in spite of that rather grudging acceptance the amendment really will be agreed to and will go into the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords so we have finally come to the end of many hours of discussion on this bill <e> <s> of course in this house we pride ourselves in having experts on every subject <e> <s> i am certain that when a heritage bill of this kind comes along it must be the dread of the civil servants and the front bench because a few experts are fine but this is really too much <e> <s> however it did seem right to me at the time to form an informal all-party committee to discuss the bill behind the scenes and i am very grateful to all those who took part <e> <s> i am sure that together we have greatly improved the bill in a very good bipartisan way <e> <s> there has been virtually no party conflict and i am most delighted about that <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene briefly tonight because for many years i have been president of the disabled drivers motor club and with them i have fought many battles some with the late graham hill who did so much for disabled people against for instance the disabled vehicle at the time when it was such a deathtrap which has now led to the very satisfactory mobile allowance <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much welcome the opportunity to address your lordships house today because i speak as a development commissioner <e> <s> for many the development commission is perhaps one of the unknown quangos but in fact it is one of the oldest in this type of operation <e> <s> i remind your lordships that it was set up by david lloyd george as long ago as <e> <s> its job was then as it is now to assist english rural areas and particularly to advise the government on the spending of the development fund a sum which is voted annually in parliament <e> <s> in general terms this money is spent on any project which will benefit rural areas provided that no other statutory assistance exists <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> is he aware that what he has said will be of considerable comfort to the owners of the more exotic and historic vehicles such as vintage bentleys and so on the continuing use of which gives immense pleasure to the general public <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who was concerned with many of these points <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i apologise <e> <s> as one who was concerned with other noble lords about many of the points which have been covered by the amendments may i say how very warmly we <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that those of us who have had direct connection with the manpower services commission have nothing but admiration for what it is doing <e> <s> in particular those young people who are employed get enormously important experience and often jobs at the end <e> <s> we should do more to support the manpower services commission for doing a good job <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend bear in mind that those of us who have been concerned with tourist boards for many years and who will welcome measures to prevent duplication in this country will find it very puzzling that now there is to be total duplication abroad since it must only fragment the efforts of this country to sell britain abroad if there are four boards all trying to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the first time that i have addressed your lordships house since my appointment as chairman of the historic buildings and monuments commission <e> <s> it was a great honour and pleasure for me to be invited to take on the leadership of this commission and also a great privilege and challenge <e> <s> i hope that there will be many occasions upon which i shall be able to offer the help of the commission in its work and statutory duty indeed of preserving our historic heritage and advancing the knowledge and enjoyment of the public of that heritage <e> <s> the commission has not yet in fact taken on its full responsibilities <e> <s> it does so on st april next year <e> <s> however i hope that the commission can play some part even before then <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene only briefly and i apologise first to the noble lord lord strabolgi for not being in my place to hear his opening remarks <e> <s> i speak on behalf of the museums association to express their deep concern about the plight of these four museums and indeed other university museums <e> <s> they appreciate the dilemma that faces the vice-chancellors and others who are determining the spending of university funds when they have a terrible choice to make between a new academic post or a new research post and perhaps the founding of a museum post <e> <s> what is of no doubt at all is that they are of far wider interest than just to the citizens where they are situated <e> <s> there is international interest in them <e>", "<cs> my lords as chairman of the historic buildings and monuments commission may i express its appreciation to her majestys government for their acceptance of the commissions arguments for the zero-rating of structural alterations to listed buildings <e> <s> however may i take this opportunity to express the commissions continuing concern with regard to the test under which alterations must reach per cent <e> <s> of the total cost <e> <s> will not her majestys government agree that perhaps it would be more realistic and equitable to make it per cent <e> <s> thus reducing the harshness of the test and resulting in more listed buildings being preserved for alternative use <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the steady growth of tourism is indeed good news for those of us who are concerned with the built heritage the conservation of which largely depends on tourist profits for it to be achieved <e> <s> perhaps he would confirm that in addition to directly connected jobs there are enormous numbers of jobs in publishing souvenirs catering and indeed in construction in this country which are indirectly concerned with tourism <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene briefly in this debate to comment on an aspect of this bill which since the budget has been causing considerable worry to those concerned with the conservation of our built environment <e> <s> i refer to the question of vat and historic buildings <e> <s> before i do so perhaps i should declare an interest because as chairman of the historic buildings and monuments commission <e> <s> i as well as commissioners and staff of the commission have been active in trying to secure concessions to the original proposals to charge vat on alterations to listed buildings <e> <s> we and others sharing the same concern have helped <e> <s> i hope constructively in persuading the government to make concessions which potentially will ensure that our historic buildings are cared for in a way which is consistent with the governments expressed policy <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a bill that clearly must command support from all parties <e> <s> it deals with two glaring anachronisms in present legislation and closes the door on a distasteful piece of exploitation <e> <s> i strongly support the bill but speak tonight representing the views of the historic buildings and monuments commission and therefore must declare an interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with interest to what the minister said and though i am not entirely convinced i heard with considerable pleasure that there will be this inquiry <e> <s> i hope that it can be done urgently <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to what the noble lord the minister has said but i must confess that i remain unconvinced <e> <s> of course i am very pleased that there will be an inquiry and we shall certainly co-operate with it <e> <s> but he has not persuaded me that it is sensible in the meantime to leave conservation areas at risk especially when all the publicity attached to the inquiry not to mention the subsequent legislation will continually remind developers of better ways to exploit the compensation <e> <s> the noble lord has repeated that he feels there is little evidence of compensation actually having been paid but as i have already said until <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> since this is the first time that i have intervened during this committee stage perhaps i should warn your lordships that i shall be speaking several times on amendments moved by the noble baroness lady birk <e> <s> perhaps as these amendments do concern the historic buildings and monuments commission i should now declare an interest as its chairman <e> <s> perhaps too i might remind the committee that the historic buildings and monuments commission was set up by an act of parliament in with all-party support in both houses and with support also from the noble baroness <e> <s> we were set up as an independent body <e> <s> we value our independence and i think that we shall wish to conserve it <e> <s> however it may be helpful to the committee if i were able from time to time to intervene and express certain views and give certain information which i believe my fellow commissioners would fully support <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the committee perhaps i may be permitted to say that the commission has already agreed to take over the equipment and the staff and will certainly continue to develop it <e> <s> moreover the commission itself has its own computers the glc were not the only people to put records on computers <e> <s> the great thing is to get them integrated and i assure the noble baroness that we are taking this very seriously <e>", "<cs> i can assure the noble baroness that compatibility will be given great importance by the commission in deciding how its computers will be ordered and operated <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness withdraws the amendment perhaps it would help if i say that when we said we would take on these new responsiblities it was on condition that we had the necessary resources to carry them out and that includes money for grants hitherto made by the glc <e> <s> it does not include the grants already made by the commission which are affected by this bill <e> <s> i believe that it is important for the commission as a responsible body to keep its freedom and its flexibility to dispose of its own resources as it thinks best <e>", "<cs> i thought it might be helpful as chairman of the historic buildings and monuments commission to say just a few words on this subject <e> <s> first i will admit that the commission is concerned that there may be a reduction in archaeological conservation work in the metropolitan counties as a result of the abolition of those councils and the disbandment of the teams <e> <s> we have been discussing with government various matters and have <e>", "<cs> may i add one point <e> <s> there are some very successful archaeological trusts in the country for example in wessex which are funded by various sources <e> <s> of course we shall continue to project fund archaeology wherever it is and it deserves such support <e>", "<cs> it might be helpful to the committee if i explain that the commission although appreciating the value of the house thinks that to transfer to the new landlords the royal borough of kensington and chelsea would be a very satisfactory solution <e> <s> the victorian society has a lease on the <e>", "<cs> perhaps it would be helpful if i were to say a few words <e> <s> may i make it quite plain that the commission is in no way politically involved in this bill <e> <s> therefore i should like to say that when we were approached by her majestys government to take over these buildings we said that we would only do so on the assurance that we would get proper funding <e> <s> we have received that assurance <e> <s> may i also remind the noble baroness who will remember this from the debate about the national heritage that the commission is in a unique position in that we are able to roll forward our grant-aid and also to keep excess profits which we intend to do <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be allowed to say a few words as chairman of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for reminding the house that these monuments stonehenge and the white horse are the responsibility of the commission <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that in addition to the consultations which he announced would take place between the government and other bodies it is the intention of the commission to convene a meeting of other interested parties so that next year we can organise a solstice ceremony which will be dignified and well-regulated for people who will respect the stones <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware how warmly this will be welcomed by all those concerned in the tourist industry as it will at last give the opportunity of employing a lot more young people particularly vocationally in giving work training which will be of great benefit to them in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that a large number of motorcyclists would encourage any legislation to decrease the noise for they are fed up with the antics of one or two cowboys who spoil the whole name of motorcycling <e> <s> would not a most effective measure be for the police to have powers to stop and impound motorcycles and then release them when they are proved roadworthy so far as sound is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome this bill <e> <s> i do so especially as chairman of the historic buildings and monuments commission in which of course i must declare an interest <e> <s> i should like to remind the house that under the local government act which abolishes the glc my commission will on st april next assume many responsibilities with regard to historic buildings and archaeology in the greater london area and in particular the responsibility for ensuring the continuation of the excellent work hitherto done by the glcs historic buildings division <e> <s> in that respect i can confirm that the commission will be offering jobs to all those in that historic buildings division who wish to join us <e>", "<cs> it might be helpful if i clarify the comments that i made on th february at second reading on the question of the commissions funding of the passmore-edwards museum <e> <s> it is our firm and declared intention to discuss directly with the passmore-edwards museum its funding requirements and to ensure that the agreed sum is passed on in total by the museum of london who totally understand the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble baroness lady birk that there have been misapprehensions and some confusion on the part of the museum of london and the passmore-edwards museum about clause of this bill <e> <s> as chairman of english heritage which will be responsible for the funding of archaeology in london in the future i should like to take this final opportunity to end any misunderstanding that may exist <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend lord auckland that the debate initiated by my noble friend lord campbell is indeed timely and apt <e> <s> i should like to say a few words about what i know the world considers to be britains greatest tourist asset <e> <s> i refer of course to our heritage our historic buildings our churches and cathedrals our museums our historic towns our landscapes and our theatres <e> <s> for nearly years i have personally been working for and promoting both here and overseas these jewels in britains tourist crown <e> <s> looking back to what a remarkable success story it has been <e> <s> it is the envy of other countries particularly in europe <e> <s> the recent treasure houses of britain exhibition in washington was recognition of and tribute to a success to which successive governments individuals and organisations like the bta the hha and the national trust can claim to have been major contributors <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise because circumstances prevented me from being in the house for the start of this important debate <e> <s> i wish that it could have been otherwise so that i could have heard the maiden speeches of my noble friends lord beaverbrook and lord brocket <e> <s> a long-standing official engagement made that impossible <e> <s> it is only because i came by helicopter that i am here <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend very much for that assurance and in view of it i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in our second reading debate i warmly welcomed the assurance of my noble friend lord glenarthur that the government would be looking carefully at the arguments i put forward in favour of creating an offence of trespass and i have looked forward to debating a government amendment in committee <e> <s> however in the continuing absence of such an amendment from the government themselves i have put my name to amendments nos <e> <s> and in order to provide protection for the rights <e>", "<cs> i should like warmly to welcome the action the government have taken in tabling this amendment <e> <s> it certainly seeks to remedy a very pernicious state of affairs over the past years not just with one farmer last summer whereby groups of people have deliberately set out to disregard the rights of owners and occupiers to enjoy the benefit of their land and have posed a great threat not only to land but so far as i understand most importantly to monuments on it <e> <s> there is the distress of owners and <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend one question <e> <s> will he please remember that i have been dealing with protecting scheduled ancient monuments so far as agriculture is concerned <e> <s> i hope that he will look particularly at that point <e>", "<cs> it may be helpful if i as chairman of english heritage make a few remarks <e> <s> i am sorry that i am unable to agree with my noble friends on this subject because i believe that these amendments are based on a misunderstanding of the nature of the listing of historic buildings and the effects of listing <e>", "<cs> yes i am here <e>", "<cs> i listened with great interest to what the noble lord lord skelmersdale said and on behalf of the historic buildings and monuments commission i welcome the fact that at long last progress has been made on this very difficult and complex issue <e> <s> naturally the commission will need to study the details <e>", "<cs> i should briefly like to say that the commission is conscious of the fact that the definition in section may occasionally if rarely lead to difficulties <e> <s> i have been made aware of the calderdale case of which the noble lord is probably aware too and how much of a jungle the lawyers find this piece of law <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may be allowed to help the noble lord <e> <s> there is no equivalent commission in wales to english heritage in england and all the matters dealing with the heritage are still in the hands of the secretary of state for wales <e>", "<cs> it is late and i do not wish to carry on this discussion for too long <e> <s> naturally i am disappointed with the noble lords reply <e> <s> it would appear that we shall have to rely on the reserve powers of the secretary of state for call-in cases and i think that means that we and the amenity societies will have to be all the more vigilant and make quite sure that important buildings do not slip through the net <e> <s> i think that that is something that we shall have to do but i hope that the noble lord will bear my remarks in mind because some very important buildings could be lost unless we are careful <e> <s> in view of that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to repeat the arguments i set out at committee stage against the need for a formal appeals procedure against listing <e> <s> however as chairman of english heritage whose duty it is to advise the secretary of state on listing i remain convinced of the validity of those arguments <e> <s> i should like to reassure the house that the system is operating conscientiously and fairly and provides adequate safeguards for aggrieved owners and occupiers <e> <s> however i admit that aggravation may have been caused in one or two cases in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene very briefly just to express a few views on behalf of the historic buildings commission of which i am chairman <e> <s> we have no doubt that the effects of the canary wharf development on london as a whole and on the regeneration of the east end in particular will be indeed profound particularly on the historic buildings of which there are so many in that area <e> <s> however my commission does not take an indiscriminate objection to new development nor does it make a blanket objection to redevelopment <e> <s> indeed i was the chairman of a committee and that led to the report on new users for old buildings <e> <s> certainly many old buildings are finding new users down there <e>", "<cs> my lords i make this brief intervention to the debate tonight and i am proud to declare an interest as president of the disabled drivers motor club <e> <s> i am glad to see one of my vice-presidents lady masham here who will be speaking after me <e> <s> i hope we do not disagree too much <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is hardly necessary for me to tell you that my home beaulieu is very close to lyndhurst and i like the noble earl lord malmesbury am able to exercise common rights in the forest <e> <s> it is therefore very natural that i should he most concerned about and interested in this bill <e> <s> in fact the majority of people living in the new forest are very concerned <e> <s> they have been concerned with attempts to solve this problem for the past years having endured two public inquiries three local consultation exercises and numerous public meetings not forgetting enduring the appalling traffic jams which strangle lyndhurst and the immediate surrounding area daily throughout the year and to an intolerable degree in the summer <e>", "<cs> my lords wtih respect i said almost unanimously <e>", "<cs> my lords historically the county council has always kept such matters to be resolved within the county boundaries and i agree that this is a sad departure from such a tradition <e> <s> however perhaps another reason for the county councils resolve was that it seemed to it that such a bill was the only way out after years of obstruction by many who until recently opposed a bypass <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house will be enormously grateful to my noble friend for raising this very timely question this evening <e> <s> at beaulieu we were very much in the eye of the storm and considerable damage was done <e> <s> however i speak tonight not as a victim of the storm but as the chairman of english heritage which is one of the government agencies that is trying to do what <e>", "<cs> my lords may i take this opportunity to congratulate the secretary of state for the environment on the efficiency with which the english heritages listing recommendations have been handled by his department <e> <s> may i also assure <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also ask the noble earl <e>", "<cs> whether he is aware that we have had a full-time inspector employed on the listing of kiosks since last june and that we have been greatly encouraged by the thousands of letters we have received from the general public expressing their preference for the gilbert scott award-winning design of years ago to the modern ones that have been put up especially in conservation areas <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my special pleasure to congratulate the noble earl lord lindsay on his extremely well-informed maiden speech <e> <s> perhaps because of his modesty he did not tell your lordships that he was for many years a member of the british tourist authority and is still closely connected with it <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl will give the house the benefit of his wisdom in future debates on this important matter <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend agree that a few weeks ago very few people in this country knew of the existence of the mappa mundi <e> <s> will she also agree that after this welcome golden shower of publicity the dean and chapter may be well advised to show enterprise and responsibility by placing the map on public show charging the public and using the income for the conservation of the cathedral <e> <s> if they have any doubts about the tourist value perhaps the dean and chapter will consult the english tourist board <e>", "<cs> my lords over the past years there have been many debates in your lordships house on historic houses and i believe that i have taken part in most of them atone time as president of the historic houses association and today i must declare my interest as chairman of english heritage <e> <s> i think that the debate which noble lords will remember best is that dramatic one in march when the party opposite was trying to find a solution to saving mentmore <e> <s> i am sorry that <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the impression that i had but i apologise to the right reverend prelate <e> <s> however i must totally deny those charges because i think noble lords must be aware that thousands of listed building consents are given every week without any delay and only a tiny proportion raise important issues which have to be discussed <e> <s> more often than not discussions with architects can solve the problems and i can certainly point to hundreds of witnesses who will vouch for that and testify that we are very flexible <e>", "<cs> my lords many in this house and many more outside will welcome the question of the noble lord lord kennet this afternoon <e> <s> it is very timely and touches on a matter of some importance <e> <s> the house also acknowledges his expertise in this matter <e> <s> he is not only a most knowledgeable and lifetime local resident but he is a former minister for the environment with a particular interest in all aspects of conservation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lords who have spoken in this debate especially those who supported the second reading of the bill <e> <s> i listened with great interest to what my noble friend lord lucas of chilworth said <e> <s> he has great knowledge of southampton <e> <s> i hope he will forgive me at this late hour for not answering his points in detail <e> <s> however i can assure him that i or the promoters will be in touch with him shortly to do just that <e> <s> i certainly take issue with him about southampton not being a tourist centre indeed it is improving all the time <e> <s> further he forgot to mention the famous and fine art gallery which the city possesses <e> <s> however having said that i am sure that all such matters like the question of a company are covered in my speech <e> <s> indeed if the noble lord reads my speech i think he will see that i explained why i believe a company is necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware of the deep concern felt by english heritage about clause of the bill which would virtually drive a coach and horses through all planning legislation to protect historic buildings and ancient monuments and would provide a bad precedent for the future <e> <s> is he also aware that british rail is challenging english heritages right to petition against the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i must start by declaring an interest because the brief points that i need to make in connection with this debate concern the interests of english heritage of which i am chairman <e> <s> english heritage has had recent experience of the defects and the possible abuses of the operation of private bills which makes it a matter of major national concern and also to other non-departmental public bodies or quangos as they are known <e>", "<cs> my lords in welcoming the ministers statement is he not aware of the confusion caused in planning circles by this decision <e> <s> will he do whatever he can to ensure that the statement he made today will be communicated to local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in th century london that area was better known for its brothels than its theatres <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for his reply to my amendment <e> <s> i understand that the wording of the clause is perhaps flawed in some ways <e> <s> however we have had a useful debate on the clause <e> <s> i take the point that the test which my noble friend outlined might not apply to such property trusts and i certainly welcome an opportunity on behalf of those preservation trusts and english heritage to come to the department and discuss them further <e> <s> i hope he will bear in mind that this will have to be defined better by the time we reach report stage <e> <s> in view of the assurance i have had this afternoon that this matter will be looked at with us i beg <e>", "<cs> i have no doubt that noble lords will look forward to having this clarified at report stage <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great pleasure for me to congratulate the noble lord lord walpole on behalf of the whole house on his excellent and well informed maiden speech <e> <s> he certainly chose a subject which he knows well because he was at one time chairman of the south east area museum service and also a very able chairman of the east anglian tourist board <e> <s> i am sure that we look forward to hearing him take part in debates in your lordships house especially when he speaks on subjects which he knows so well <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that
