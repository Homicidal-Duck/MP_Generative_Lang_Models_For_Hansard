["<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord cullen for the way in which he introduced this bill <e> <s> i hope that i will not delay the business of the house too long <e> <s> as the noble lord lord soames said in moving the motion this bill is moderately uncontroversial <e> <s> lord cullen referred to the fact that there were two aspects to the bill <e> <s> one is the bonus for pensioners which i think all of us in the house welcome we welcome the fact that it will now come to pensioners in their own right without an annual bill coming before the house although many noble lords would hope that in terms of value it can keep up with rising costs <e> <s> however the noble lord then went on to indicate that there was a second aspect to the bill and it is to that that i should like to direct my remarks <e> <s> i am referring of course to clause of the bill which has the purpose of freezing the earnings limit for dependents <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i would accept that but i think that we would then be moving into a situation where both husband and wife or both spouses would be building up over a period their own entitlement to social security in retirement and that is a situation which we do not have at present <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may first declare an interest and secondly therefore seek the approval of the house to put a further question to the minister <e> <s> it seems in looking at paragraph of the white paper that even british women born here are going to have no automatic right to bring a spouse into this country <e> <s> what they have is the right to seek permission to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords may i again declare an interest and seek the indulgence of the house to speak on a subject on which i have spoken on a number of occasions in a different context namely as chairman of the equal opportunities commission a commission which has as its responsibility to eradicate discrimination on grounds of sex and to promote equality of opportunity between the sexes generally <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to pay tribute to the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale for introducing this bill and also for initiating the debate on the subject last july <e> <s> i should also like to thank him for the way he outlined the main provisions of the bill tonight <e> <s> those of us who are laymen and laywomen in this field would i think find that very helpful both in clarifying some of the points that we were doubtful about and also in confirming some of the interpretations that we may have put on the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the noble earl on his speech <e> <s> he tells us that he has spent years in the engineering world <e> <s> i think he has shown to us this afternoon that in this house he will be an excellent advocate not only for the engineering profession but also for the air force as well <e> <s> i think perhaps this is the first time that we have welcomed a trenchard brat into the house but if that is a term of endearment then i am sure the house would endorse it <e> <s> it is very rarely that we have the benefit of hearing two maiden speeches and from such experts on the subject that we are considering <e> <s> i should like to add my congratulations to those which have been already extended to the noble lord lord scanlon by the noble earl lord bessborough <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the motion standing in the name of the noble lord lord avebury <e> <s> when this issue was debated some months ago i concentrated on the sex discriminatory aspects of the matter and shall do so again today <e> <s> first however i wish to make it clear that i welcome the changes that have been made since that debate in particular those which now give some rights to british women in relation to bringing their husbands and fiancs into this country <e> <s> these changes will remove much of the uncertianty and anxiety that many women had and i am glad that the government noted the strong feeling of women in britain and were sensitive to their views <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble baroness would allow me to put a point to her <e> <s> would she not agree that when this matter was debated in december of last year i said in the course of my speech that i did not accept the question of enforced marriages and arranged marriages <e> <s> perhaps for the sake of the record she would wish to make it clear that those people concerned with the sex discrimination act have not in any way condoned this <e> <s> may i ask whether she would also like to make it clear that the then deputy chairman of the equal opportunities commission lady howe and myself made representations to three home secretaries on this whole question <e> <s> i am sure the noble baroness would not want that to go unnoticed <e>", "<cs> my lords social security is always a very complicated subject and the bill that we are considering today is no exception as the noble baroness in her introduction demonstrated <e> <s> nevertheless as the noble baroness lady macleod of borve has just indicated it is a very important subject <e> <s> therefore we must try to find our way around the complications <e> <s> we are at the beginning of a new era at the start of the s and it would seem appropriate that we should seek to legislate in the field of social security for the <e>", "<cs> my lords like other speakers in the debate i am very grateful to the noble lord lord scanlon not only for his speech but for giving us the opportunity to debate this subject at a time when the employment and training act is under review and when we need to lift our sights rather higher than the present economic recession and look to the training needs of the future <e> <s> as many noble lords have indicated it is unfortunately a fact that we are falling back falling back not just in our competitive position as regards industry and trade but also in relation to the provisions that we make for training provisions which are very essential to industry <e>", "<cs> my lords like many speakers am grateful to the noble baroness lady seear for placing this motion on the order paper and enabling us to discuss the very difficult problems of racial and sexual discrimination <e> <s> i should like to follow the noble lord lord avebury in offering congratulations to our three maiden speakers all of whose contributions in a different way showed very real understanding of the problems with which we are dealing <e> <s> the right reverend prelate said that he did not think it was appropriate for him to deal with the subject of sex discrimination <e> <s> i was sorry about that particularly when he went on to indicate his sympathy with one area of sex discrimination which is outside the province of the law <e> <s> perhaps on some future occasion when he is not constrained by the non-controversial nature of the maiden speech he might let us into his secret thoughts in this area <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister will be aware i have on many occasions raised with his department the anomalies that have arisen in the past because of the fact that women have been unable to pass on citizenship to their children <e> <s> i am very grateful for the way in which the minister has handled this bill and for the care which he has taken to try to ensure that there is equality between men and women in this important area <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords who have preceded me i should like to pay tribute to the noble lord lord beswick for enabling <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the report of the noble and learned lord lord scarman as being a very real contribution towards solving what is a very difficult problem <e> <s> i want to concentrate on and refer in particular to what he says in his conclusions when he calls for a concerted attack on discrimination co-ordinated by central government and related in particular to education and employment <e> <s> he says <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister not agree that in the light of the current figures on married womens economic activity rates which show that per cent <e> <s> of all married women between the ages of and are economically active the household duties test for married women alone for the award of a non-contributory penion is totally outdated and a matter of absolute sex discrimination <e> <s> can he tell me when the government propose to act in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate the noble baroness lady carnegy on her maiden speech <e> <s> the constructive nature of the speech i think was much appreciated by the whole of the house and i certainly agree with the sentiments she expressed when she said that education and training represented one of the most important aspects of the subject we are discussing today <e>", "<cs> my lords i have some sympathy with the minister this evening <e> <s> i am sure he must feel that he has been here before with on the one hand pressure on him to be careful and not to go too far and on the other hand pressure on him to extend the changes that are envisaged in the white paper <e> <s> it may be some consolation if i tell him that perhaps i can claim to have had a longer history than he in this connection <e> <s> it was in that as chairman of the equal opportunities commission i first made representations to a home secretary on this matter <e> <s> referring to nationality and all related administrative procedures i said on that occasion that the commissions sole concern is for parity of treatment for men and women within the governments overall policy in relation to numbers <e> <s> it is in that context that i want to speak tonight <e> <s> it is also in that context that i must declare my interest as the chairman of the equal opportunities commission <e> <s> the commission has assumed that one of its statutory responsibilities is to press successive governments to bring about a state of equality between the sexes in relation to nationality and immigration <e> <s> the purpose of the white paper which we are debating this evening is to bring the immigration rules into line with the new british nationality act <e> <s> in so far as its proposals give rights to british citizens whether or not they were born here i welcome it but i must point out that if the immigration rules are to be logical then they should follow through the principles of the british nationality act <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to welcome the report and to thank the noble lord lord seebohm and the members of his committee for the very detailed way in which they approached their task <e> <s> i agree with their broad conclusions and i also agree with some of their recommendations on the tightening up on some of the draft articles in the directive <e> <s> i have a reservation <e> <s> i would go even further than they do when they enter doubts that this particular draft directive may not provide a workable balance for us in this country <e> <s> i would suggest that it does provide a workable balance <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so i was drawing a distinction between a regulation and a directive a regulation which applies throughout the community and a directive which leaves it up to the individual governments to introduce their own domestic legislation in order to comply with the principles in the directive <e> <s> i do not think that that conflicts with what the noble lord has just read out <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether we can draw a distinction between the meaning of two parts of this particular clause <e> <s> the clause talks about the numbers and the terms and conditions of service <e> <s> the terms and conditions are determined as the minister has rightly said at national level but that is the terms and conditions of particular grades <e> <s> surely what we are talking about in this particular clause and the amendment is the numbers at particular levels <e> <s> it would seem appropriate when we are establishing a new and important organisation such as this that the appropriate trade union should be consulted about the numbers at different levels and therefore the terms and conditions which would apply to those levels <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the amendments <e> <s> i do so on the grounds that i think the nature of this offence is something which we must take into account <e> <s> i very much appreciate the arguments of my noble friend lord mcintosh of haringey and others about custodial offences and not wanting to <e>", "<cs> my lords it is perhaps appropriate that i should have the privilege of following the noble lord lord ingrow and of congratulating him on his maiden speech <e> <s> i do so as one yorkshire person to another <e> <s> indeed were we lords spiritual we might even have been tempted to cancel out each others vote at the last general election because we both happen to come from the same parliamentary constituency <e> <s> it is always surprising and rewarding to hear maiden speeches and to see the way in which members of this house bring their own individuality to their maiden speech despite the inhibitions of the occasion <e> <s> i am sure that the speech of the noble lord lord ingrow was no exception <e> <s> we shall all look forward to hearing him speak again on many occasions bringing the benefit of his experience in industry and in local government and of course his <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend lady david for introducing this very difficult and highly emotive subject <e> <s> like other noble lords i am concerned about the problems and difficulties facing school-leavers in particular the problems in finding employment <e> <s> this is not a problem which is confined to the united kingdom only it is a problem of course experienced by other european countries in particular <e> <s> but britains problem is exacerbated by two factors the intensity and the depth of the economic recession which has produced a higher rate of unemployment in the united kingdom than in any other european country with i think the exception of belgium and secondly the fact that traditionally a higher proportion of our young people have gone straight into employment from school without the advantages of further training or an apprenticeship on the lines of other european countries <e> <s> this was brought out very clearly in the report of the house of lords select committee on unemployment <e> <s> this latter factor we are now belatedly attempting to rectify through the youth training scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i thank the noble earl for that correction indeed it was the first world war and the older workers not yet having completely moved out of the labour market that he spoke of <e> <s> but the point that i was making is that the bulge is now moving out of the school system <e> <s> surely that means that we are in a position to use the resources of the school system to improve the services rather than cutting back simply because numbers have decreased <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise sadly to support the noble baroness in her unstarred question because the discrimination against married women in the awarding of the invalid care allowance and the housewives non-contributory invalidity pension has gone on for far too long <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness who is to reply from the government benches will have some encouraging news for us <e> <s> i am not sure whether to feel pleased that she is there to reply to this debate or to be concerned for her lest she should have to give us the same discouraging response that we have had in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords may i too thank the noble baroness <e> <s> lady macleod for her initiation of this debate and for all the work she has been doing in support of the south london hospital for women <e> <s> i hope that the minister will be able to respond favourably to the many points that have already been put in the debate <e> <s> as many speakers have said the south london hospital is now unique in this country in that it is the only hospital solely for women where the medical staff too are women only <e> <s> it is the only hospital of its kind which is providing such a wide range of services in such an excellent way as the noble baroness lady macleod and others have said <e>", "<cs> my lords as we have heard that lord davies of leek is ill in his absence and with his permission i beg leave to ask the second question standing in his name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> however i wonder whether in his busy schedule as a minister he has the opportunity to hear the daily story on radio of long delays on motorways caused by road repairs <e> <s> does he not think that it would be much better to try to share the workload between road and rail by encouraging british rail by giving financial backing to extend services <e> <s> would he not further agree that with a new chairman recently appointed a chairman presumably in the managerial mould which the present administration favours this would be a good time to announce the governments priorities as regards an improvement in our investment in british rail <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble viscount would confirm having made reference to the article in <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that my experience of the msc is that they take the view that the effort involved here is too great <e> <s> in other words the clawback from government financing tends to discourage <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the clawback from government financing tends to discourage the msc from pursuing projects under the womens share of the social fund and can he assure us that he will discuss this with them to make sure that they too do everything to encourage take-up <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate is about the future of the national health service and we are grateful to the noble lord lord molloy for introducing it <e> <s> however from the contributions that have already been made it is clear that the debate is also about a crisis in the national health service a crisis in the financing of the service and a crisis in confidence within the service <e> <s> i suggest that there are three contributory factors involved here <e> <s> the first is the continuing development of medical science and techniques <e> <s> the second is the demographic changes with an increasing number of elderly within our community and the third is the government policy of financial constraint <e>", "<cs> my lords i approach this bill with a sense of unease and uncertainty a sense of unease which not even the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor in his very illuminating introduction of the bill nor the persuasive comments of the noble and learned lord lord scarman have quite removed <e>", "<cs> my lords i do thank the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for reprimanding me on that <e> <s> of course the earning capacity is related to spouses but in the present situation i think he would agree that in the majority of cases it is the wife who has care and custody of the children and therefore it is the woman who is in the greatest difficulty in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to approach this debate from a regional point of view and i must say that i find myself in very great sympathy with much that the noble viscount lord eccles said <e> <s> i really want to make two points <e> <s> we have heard of the great theatre companies the great museums and the great orchestras in london and i support the principle that london should be a centre of excellence but i think that if london is to remain the centre of excellence it must draw on the services and the state of the arts in the regions both the visual arts and the performing arts <e> <s> i was reminded of this only this past week-end when i was supporting an art fair in leeds a fair which had been organised by artists by friends of artists and by business with some support from local government <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself in a very anomalous position because for over three years as the noble earl will appreciate i have been pressing the government to amend the equal pay act to include equal pay for work of equal value <e> <s> now i find myself in a position where i cannot support the proposals which the government are putting forward <e> <s> i am very grateful to the government for the changes which they have made since the first consultative document was put out and i am equally grateful for some of the changes that have been made in the procedure regulations during the past week or so <e> <s> however i would suggest that it is no good concentrating on the procedure regulations <e> <s> they are largely irrelevant until we amend the main regulations themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also include then the law officers as well as the department of employment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down will he remove a misapprehension that appears to prevail among some members of your lordships house namely that there is a time constraint of st january for this regulation to get through <e> <s> i appreciate fully that it is the governments own reaction to the european judgment <e> <s> but will he assure the house that we are under no compulsion from europe to get the regulation through <e>", "<cs> on second reading there was great concern in all parts of your lordships house not to diminish marriage as an institution nor to do anything that would encourage the break-up of marriage <e> <s> i think the one-year bar in itself diminishes the institution of marriage <e> <s> i do not think it gives the parties a sufficiently long time to work out the marriage and to make sure that the marriage will continue <e> <s> but it is difficult for us to determine just how long is required to make a successful marriage <e> <s> the marriage itself and the two parties involved should be the determining factors <e> <s> we should concentrate on the quality of the marriage <e> <s> therefore in that sense i support the amendment in the name of the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> this puts the onus and responsibility on individuals to ensure that their marriage will continue <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister can tell us if there are any regional variations in the statistics which he has given to us <e> <s> is the department of education and science aware of the reasons behind those differences if there are such differences and are any steps being taken to help those regions which may have a lower than average attainment ability <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give an indication of what proportion of the funds which have been distributed have come to the united kingdom in the way he has just described <e> <s> is he further aware that there is a certain amount of concern in this country about the fact that the money which is available for activities of this kind is not shared out in the way that the united kingdom would like <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for the way that he <e>", "<cs> i follow the logic of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor in this matter and quite clearly the amendment is not drafted in the best possible way <e> <s> i am quite sure that no one would in any way want to detract from the importance of primary secondary and tertiary education <e> <s> but looking at the amendment i think that its point is to include those aspects of education which quite frankly both state and individual parents tend to some extent to neglect in particular nursery education <e>", "<cs> i understand the tremendous burdens which the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has enumerated <e> <s> i must confess that those burdens were not so clear to me before i moved the amendment as they are now <e> <s> i take note of what the noble and learned lord says about the serious defects <e>", "<cs> if i may say a further word without gazing into the crystal ball it would be helpful even to look back on the past years rise in the cost of living index and perhaps in some way link it with that <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that this is not only a problem of maintaining an effective library service important though that is for educational and cultural purposes but that there are also serious consequences for authors for the publishing industry and for those aspects of distribution and retail which are concerned in the business of books including a very important element of export <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister will recall and i am sure he will that in the recent debate on the arts he said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble earl will feel we have had a very interesting debate on the basis of his introduction of the bill <e> <s> most of the speakers who have taken part in this debate have not objected in any way to the idea of encouraging innovation in education but the majority have objected to the way in which the secretary of state is suggesting that it should be done <e>", "<cs> i have a great deal of sympathy with those noble lords who have spoken against having a fragmented authority with different members representing different interests <e> <s> but unlike the noble lord who has just spoken <e> <s> i take an entirely different view of this particular aspect <e> <s> unfortunately i was not in the house during the second reading but i read the debate very carefully <e> <s> on reading the debate one realises that the contributions came very much from the experts <e> <s> this is a very technical matter <e> <s> while i accept what has been said about the approach of the home secretary to this matter <e> <s> i believe that in a new area such as this it is important to ensure that the consumers interests and point of view will be taken into account <e> <s> it is not just a question of the national consumer council because no single body should have a right to nominate <e> <s> but it is a question of trying to assess the various interests of a community as a whole and of appointing someone within the community who is in touch with grass roots points of view and who can speak on behalf of those people <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might add one further point to the excellent points which have been made in favour of this amendment which i certainly support <e> <s> at an earlier point in the committee when we were talking about representation on the authority i made the comment that we really needed someone who was involved in grass roots issues and who knew about the feelings and the needs of the local community <e> <s> in replying to that discussion the noble lord the minister stated that consumers had one excellent weapon in their hands they did not have to take cable and that the success of cable depended on how many subscribers there were that people could always withdraw from subscribing if they were not satisfied <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble viscount will take note of a number of factors which contribute to the problems which local authorities are now facing <e> <s> like my noble friend i welcome the statement that there are to be discussions on this matter <e> <s> but would the noble viscount not agree or would he put it to his noble friend that there are a number of factors involved <e> <s> the first is that under the arrangements for mode a places there can be reimbursement to companies where the take-up of places at the end of the day is not as was expected at the beginning of the day <e> <s> but that does not apply to local authorities even if they are sponsoring mode a schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord replies <e> <s> i wonder whether i may add one comment <e> <s> if it should be that the law commission is too occupied to take up this matter i wonder whether the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor could give us an assurance that the recommendations of the occupational pensions board could be looked at more closely because that board looked very carefully at all the implications of pensions in relation to the divorced and separated woman and their recommendations were very specific <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble and learned lord has not read it because i was just about to say i am sure he does not need me to protect him from scurrilous articles of this description i am sure he is capable of looking after himself and i hope he will look at it very carefully and take steps to reject it <e> <s> it states that he is eating out of the hand of campaign for justice in divorce <e> <s> it is that kind of publicity which really has done much more than the <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble and learned lord i hope he will recall that i did say that i was referring to wives but it could equally apply to husbands <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes for pointing out on the basis of her experience how difficult it is to assess future earning capacity <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble lord lord foot for pointing out to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor that my remarks were not sexist or based on sexism <e> <s> indeed as the noble lord pointed out the law commission made reference to the need to encourage women to move towards greater financial independence <e> <s> i thought that one of the overriding principles behind the bill was so that we could move to a situation where if it were possible there could be a clean break <e> <s> surely this clause has that in mind <e> <s> it is preparing people for the clean break <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support my noble friends amendment <e> <s> much as i am tempted and greatly as i sympathise with what he was saying i shall not follow the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale down the path of the primary interest of a child beyond the age of except to say that i think it is right to state that tertiary education could include someone between the ages of and in a college of further education for example where they were taking a qualification lower than a university qualification <e> <s> my noble friend has pointed out that this amendment has taken aboard some of the comments that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor made on second reading <e> <s> so the amendment does now include all aspects of education in the sense of the act <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad the amendment has thrown light on one situation even if it has not thrown light on the subject of the amendment itself <e> <s> i must apologise to the noble and learned lords the lord chancellor and lord simon of glaisdale for the late submission of the amendment it was due to a misunderstanding arising from the submission of the previous amendment and certain subsections have not been put in for amendment <e> <s> i apologise and i understand that it may have caused confusion <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the minister for that reply and also welcome the steps that have been taken in ending the grant for year-olds under the young workers scheme <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister would again consider the possibility of incorporating the year-olds into the youth training scheme in particular those year-olds who have stayed on at school for another year where employers would qualify under the young workers scheme for a grant of per week <e> <s> would the minister consider using this grant of a week together with the million that it is estimated has been saved on the youth training scheme to expand the youth training scheme and to include the year-olds <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble minister agree that my question says nothing at all about failure of the scheme <e> <s> my question refers to the failure of the youth training scheme to meet its target entry <e> <s> surely he has himself admitted that the number of people taken into yts is instead of the they were expecting <e>", "<cs> is it not a fact that the advertising standards authority is a self-regulatory authority of the industry <e> <s> is it not also a fact that the advertising standards authority co-operates with the iba on advertisements but it does not itself handle them it passes complaints on to the iba <e> <s> in that sense the advertising standards authority is in an entirely different position from the iba in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for his reply and welcome the fact that there is some monitoring of the numbers of male and female entrants to the yts <e> <s> however in view of the manpower services commissions research projects the results of which were published in r and d series no <e> <s> by the msc would the noble earl agree that it is necessary for positive steps to be taken to try to eradicate the traditional types of training that are offered to females as opposed to males <e> <s> secondly would he also agree that a very useful first step in this direction might be for the publicity put out by the manpower services commission on the yts to take a more positive approach to the recruitment of girls for technical subjects <e> <s> some of the imbalance might then be removed <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i could press the noble earl a little further on that point <e> <s> the white paper refers to the fact that the department of education and science will be involved in appointments to the manpower services commission presumably in view of the growing role of the manpower services commission in the provision of education and training <e> <s> does this mean that the manpower services commission will remain as at present constituted with nine members <e> <s> if it is to assume the very important function of a national training body with which i am not quarrelling because it is necessary to have a national strategy for training to whom will it be accountable <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for his reply but i find it somewhat disappointing <e> <s> would he not agree that this is the kind of pilot project that should be encouraged particularly as it is hoped that the youth training scheme will become part of the modular system of training in place of the fast-declining traditional apprenticeship system <e> <s> will the noble earl undertake through his right honourable friend the secretary of state to encourage the manpower services commission and local authorities to mount such pilot projects in other places <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that in the white paper issued yesterday it says that one of the objectives of the training programme is to improve training particularly in the field of apprenticeships <e> <s> would the noble earl not agree that the birmingham initiative could be part of this improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords in the debate on th december last year i think we were all agreed that we were dealing with a very complex subject <e> <s> some felt regrettably that the regulations themselves made the subject even more complex <e> <s> i think what we have heard tonight underlines that and perhaps a testimony to the complexity of the subject the principal regulations and now the procedure regulations is the fact that on both the government had to take the regulations hack several times before they thought that had got it right <e> <s> but even now it would seem that the joint committee on statutory instruments feels that the government have not got it right <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask a fundamental question on this <e> <s> if the tribunal having heard from the official expert and the experts perhaps of the applicant favours the evidence of the applicant could the tribunal in those circumstances make a decision in favour of the applicant but in contradiction to the official experts report <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the minister has not been more sympathetic towards this group of amendments <e> <s> he said that we were talking about grants for areas of national priority <e> <s> the bill says nothing about areas of national priority and we do not know what those areas will be <e> <s> we shall not know until the bill has been passed <e> <s> therefore we are discussing matters in the dark <e> <s> a number of projects have been suggested in the consultative document in the discussions in another place and in our discussions on second reading but we do not yet know what the projects will be <e> <s> therefore nobody at this stage can judge how much priority to attach to them <e>", "<cs> i wonder if i might first of all reply to lady cox who expressed surprise at my noble friend and i supporting this particular amendment in view of our later amendments she suggested we were ambivalent <e> <s> i do not think we are at all ambivalent <e> <s> i think it is the government that are being ambivalent <e> <s> if the government knew what they wanted to spend the money on then i think we could look at the situation objectively but the government at the present time do not know what the money is going to be spent on <e> <s> the purpose of the later amendments is to try to identify what it should be spent on <e>", "<cs> the process of consultation usually takes place before a bill is placed before the house <e> <s> had there been proper consultation before the bill was introduced we would all have known where we were <e> <s> this is one of the difficulties local authorities are now faced with <e> <s> they are being asked to consult after some of their power has been taken away from them <e> <s> they may have been perfectly happy to give up some of their own powers had they known exactly what the money was going to be spent on <e> <s> so i really do not think there is any ambivalence here <e>", "<cs> there are some difficulties and some complications here <e> <s> the grants are not going to fall evenly on all authorities <e> <s> it could be that one authority which was getting very near to the penalty area could be successful in obtaining a grant under this scheme <e> <s> if that was so the authority would be co-operating with the government in expending per cent <e> <s> at any rate of the expenditure from its own funds on what had been regarded as a national priority <e> <s> in other words it would be co-operating with the secretary of state <e> <s> the purpose behind this bill is to give the secretary of state more power to deploy local education authority expenditure <e> <s> the authority would therefore he co-operating with him while at the same time it could get itself into the penalty area <e> <s> there could be other local education authorities who would just pay up their per cent <e> <s> of the grant and then decide not to bid because of the costs involved in bidding and because they knew that they were already in difficulty <e> <s> however i think that there is little incentive to the local education authorities to cooperate if there is a risk of them moving into the penalty area <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl the minister for his reply <e> <s> the purpose behind the amendment is to focus on what is going to be in the regulations <e> <s> that would not in any way detract from the detailed discussions that might be going on between the minister and his department and the local authority bodies <e> <s> however in the light of what he has said i will not press the amendment at this point <e> <s> i wonder whether he can assure me that the statement which will be made will be capable of change in response to comments which are made because that would be the whole purpose of the consultative <e>", "<cs> at this point i should like to seek leave to withdraw the amendment and look carefully at what the minister has said in his reply <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful for the support which this amendment has received from all sides of the committee <e> <s> in particular we are grateful for the contributions from two former secretaries of state and i will not at this stage take issue with the noble viscount about the comparative contributions which labour and conservative governments have made to the teaching of mathematics <e>", "<cs> i support my noble friend in opposing clause on similar grounds <e> <s> my experience has been quite contrary to what the noble lord just said <e> <s> there are a number of courses which lead to professional qualifications but do not receive a mandatory award <e> <s> it will be seen from the list of courses that receive mandatory awards that very often they are the very courses that are likely to be taken by men whereas the courses which are likely to be taken up by women do not carry such grants <e> <s> this was the subject of many complaints to the equal opportunities commission in my days <e> <s> for example rightly the bec and tec courses receive mandatory grants but so do a number of comparable courses in subjects such as accountancy architecture surveying engineering and so on most of which are very much male dominated <e> <s> there is then a clutch of courses mainly paramedical courses such as physiotherapy radiography chiropody and so on which are at the moment dominated by women and which do not receive the mandatory awards <e> <s> there is a very real problem here that needs looking into <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe it is the custom for the mover of the motion for a short debate not to reply to all the points made <e> <s> perhaps that is as well because i might have been tempted to follow the noble lord the minister down one or two tracks which i do not think were actually referred to during the course of the debate <e> <s> indeed it seemed to me on occasions that he was replying to a debate that he thought was going to take place but which did not take place <e>", "<cs> while i sympathise very much with what the noble baroness has in mind <e> <s> i would point out that we are here considering what is unlawful <e> <s> at a later point in the bill we shall go on to define what is unlawful <e> <s> if it is the intention of the committee to include in the bill some measure whereby there can be positive assistance to the disabled <e> <s> i think it would be much better if that were taken under another clause <e> <s> this is the clause which is saying that it is unlawful to discriminate on grounds of disability <e> <s> it is important to establish that clearly at the outset in the bill <e>", "<cs> yes but i think there are two purposes in the bill <e> <s> one is to eliminate what the bill sill define as unlawful discrimination <e> <s> there are other provisions in the bill which go on to promote equal opportunities for the disabled <e> <s> in my experience it is important to have both those aspects included in the bill <e>", "<cs> i have some sympathy with noble lords who have said that the clause would be drawn rather widely <e> <s> i wonder whether we might be able to tighten up the amendment to some extent at report stage <e> <s> in a bill it is not possible to define either discrimination in its totality or to define disability <e> <s> while i am not suggesting to the noble lord lord renton who would be most concerned if he thought i was suggesting such a thing that there will be a lot of case law under this particular act there will be some case law <e> <s> i should hope that such case law will establish the interpretation which the courts place upon certain clauses <e> <s> in that way it will be possible for us all to understand just what discrimination means <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble baroness lady lane-fox has taken this approach to clause <e> <s> i appreciate just how much she has done in the past to assist the disabled and so on this question i do not like to be on a different side of the argument <e> <s> i speak not as one who has been deeply involved in the campaign for the disabled although i myself suffer <e>", "<cs> my lords like my noble friend lady david i am sorry that the minister is not prepared to be more flexible <e> <s> we all understand as he has said that we are talking about an upper limit of per cent <e> <s> the noble earl has advised us on a number of occasions that he does not believe the lower limit is likely to go below per cent <e> <s> one would assume that the major projects which the government want to encourage would carry the per cent <e> <s> grant <e> <s> this amendment would have increased the grant to per cent <e> <s> thus making it more possible for some local authorities to move into areas of government priority because we are talking about government priorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support the amendment <e> <s> as my noble friend lady david said it is different in form from the various amendments that we had at the committee stage <e> <s> as the noble baroness lady cox indicated in its present form it is perhaps more acceptable although i am sorry that she did not find it sufficiently acceptable to give it her support <e> <s> the amendment enables us to see more clearly the different and competing demands on the education system competing certainly in terms of finance but very often complementary in terms of educational needs as i think both my noble friends lady david and lady ewart-biggs have indicated <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support my noble friends amendment <e> <s> during the course of this bill we have discussed two principles <e> <s> one has been the discretion of the secretary of state in the use of the money which is being withdrawn from the local authority in order to provide the educational support grants and the other has been the consultation which the noble lord the minister has told us on a number of occasions that his right honourable friend the secretary of state wishes to conduct <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his answer <e> <s> however i wonder whether he realises the extent of concern there is for example in the yorkshire archaeological society and in many other such regional and national societies of this nature <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that this is a question of not only taking over the recording and the excavation of sites but is much more than that <e> <s> for example does he know that in his county and my county of west yorkshire some very important findings have taken place relating to the iron age <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister would give advice to his own department along the reassuring lines of that which he has given to the house this afternoon <e> <s> i wonder whether he is aware for instance that a letter from his department went to the council for british archaeology saying that it is for the archaeological units concerned to consider their own future in the light of the proposals for the abolition of the metropolitan counties <e> <s> will the noble lord confirm what he has just said and will he please see that information is conveyed to those who are responding on behalf of his department <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support my noble friend in this amendment <e> <s> as she has said it has been considerably changed since the discussion at report stage <e> <s> for example we have taken aboard some of the comments of the noble earl the minister at that stage when he referred to the fact that evaluation will be an on-going concern and will be built into the mechanism of the system <e> <s> in the light of that we have confined this amendment purely to the question of advice on the projects themselves and advice on the priority subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i start from the premise as have a number of your lordships today that this is not the time to cut back the numbers in higher education <e> <s> i hope that when the revised student projections are available around easter time they will more realistically reflect both the demand across the whole spectrum of the community and the need for higher education <e> <s> as the noble lord lord alport <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl the minister tell us whether the scheme will be confined to vocational education or whether it will include the wider elements of education which perhaps would help people to come to terms with the new economic circumstances in which we are living <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down may i put it to him that it is hardly in keeping with the spirit in which this bill has been discussed by all sides of the house that he should wait until his final winding-up speech to make the point that he has made about the amendment passed by this house before we reached the final third reading <e> <s> i think it would have been more helpful had the minister put forward his view at an earlier time when we were debating the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my pleasure to follow the noble lord lord forte and to congratulate him on his maiden speech <e> <s> as i am sure he is fully aware his is a household name throughout the united kindom <e> <s> there can be few of us who have not if i may put it this way experienced his hospitality on some occasion or other either at one of his trusthouse fort hotels or at one of his service centres on the motorway <e> <s> this afternoon we in this house have had the privilege of listening to the noble lord talk about the experience of his company as an important contributor to the national economy and also to the training services of the country <e> <s> we are very grateful to him for sharing that experience with us <e> <s> we look forward to hearing him speak on a number of occasions in the future <e> <s> if i may put it this way we look forward to seeing his name on the speaking list as well as in neon lights <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether following on the remarks of my noble friend lady david and of the noble lord <e> <s> lord kilmarnock i may ask the minister if he can throw a little more light on that part of his statement which refers to the new authority being subject to a statutory review <e> <s> what would be the timescale for this <e> <s> i am sure he will appreciate the importance of this in the light of the fact which he has just admitted that there will be a period in the next three years when there are three separate authorities administering education in inner london <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble baroness would confirm that for the new blood posts there is an upper age limit of <e> <s> in view of the fact that very few women were successful in achieving posts in the first batch of new blood appointments would she consider approaching her right honourable friend to see whether the age limit of could be varied in respect of women applicants particularly in view of the fact that women tend to be behind men in their career progression <e> <s> secondly in the light of the real and growing shortage of people for highly skilled information technology posts would she approach her right honourable friend the secretary of state to see whether he will consider the possibility of making available conversion courses under the heading of the information technology posts <e> <s> i understand that a number of these are conversion courses but i wonder whether her right honourable friend would consider the possibility of making a group of posts available for women in the light of the real shortage and of the fact that it is widely acknowledged <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the minister agrees that it is widely acknowledged that it is from women <e>", "<cs> that the new sources must come in the future <e>", "<cs> if there is a surplus on the transfer would the minister consider using some of the money for the purpose of special educational needs of women such as conversion courses to science and technology subjects <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that the noble baroness the minister led the british delegation to the copenhagen conference in when this convention was agreed does she not share the concern that it is taking the british government so long to ratify this convention <e> <s> would she not agree that the answer which she has given today is very similar to previous answers that have been given in both this house and in another place since december <e> <s> can the noble baroness assure us that before long does mean before the end of the decade conference in <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that the survey of the national union of students has shown that the majority of students are going to be worse off under this new agreement and the so-called rough justice which the department was claiming for the change is not going to operate <e> <s> would he not also confirm that within recent weeks the committee of directors of polytechnics has expressed very grave concern over the effect of the change on students at polytechnics because of the kind of problem which my noble friend has outlined in relation to newcastle <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all noble lords who have taken part in the debate <e> <s> the number of speakers has indicated the depth of interest in the subject by members of the house and has also revealed a very real expertise in this whole area <e> <s> i should also like to thank the minister who has responded to the debate <e> <s> the number of speakers has given him a very difficult task indeed and i think that tomorrow all of us will study very carefully his figures and the points that he made <e> <s> i doubt whether they will assuage some of the troubled thoughts that members of your lordships house have put forward but no doubt they will give us subjects for future debates <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw my motion for papers <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister also agree that the figures he has given are an underestimate of the number of women unemployed because such a high proportion of women are in part-time employment <e> <s> even if they were to register as unemployed they would not be entitled to benefit because of their part-time status <e> <s> is the minister prepared to look at this <e> <s> will the government recognise that part-time employment must qualify for unemployment benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister misunderstood my question <e> <s> the point i was making was to ask whether the government are prepared to recognise that women who have been working part-time and have become unemployed are as unemployed entitled to a benefit even if they are prepared to take up only part-time employment if part-time employment is available <e>", "<cs> i should like to add a few words to what my noble friend has said <e> <s> west yorkshire is certainly going to be a difficult problem <e> <s> the minister knows the geographical area very well and some of the districts cover a very wide geographical area <e> <s> so on top of the travel involved and their responsibilities within their own districts the representatives will have the added problem of responsibility for the metropolitan county services and on top of that again as my noble friend has just said they will have to work out how they will transfer the functions to the joint bodies <e> <s> so they really have three responsibilities and we are expecting people who were elected for one purpose within a district to take over the whole of those three functions <e> <s> in my view that is asking too much <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend on the front bench particularly in his reference to the effect that this amendment would have on subsection of clause <e> <s> i do so not in relation to the glc but in relation to west yorkshire because this is a clause which is going to affect all the metropolitan counties <e> <s> as i am sure the noble lord the minister will be aware it will have very real repercussions on west yorkshire <e>", "<cs> i was appalled at the way in which the minister moved this amendment <e> <s> i am not going to defend the glc because my noble friend lord mcintosh will i am sure be able to do that very competently <e> <s> but this bill is not about the glc it is about the glc and the six metropolitan counties <e> <s> but in moving the amendment the minister made all his comments from the point of view of the glc and he pleaded in aid of his arguments some of the peripheral activities of the glc which are controversial <e> <s> but it is not just the glc that will be affected <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to look at the motion in the name of my noble friend lord wells-pestell from the point of view of the effect of the situation upon young people <e> <s> their problem at the present time is a double one <e> <s> they have the usual normal problem of coming to terms with the adult world and they also have the problem of understanding and fitting into a world where the accepted norms are changing and sometimes changing very rapidly <e> <s> my noble friend lady nicol mentioned for example the problem of broken marriages <e> <s> there are the changes in marriage and life partnerships the changes in job opportunities and work patterns and the changes in technological industries and technological applications <e> <s> yet despite these major technological developments young people are having to come to terms with a society where the economic outlook is bleaker than at any time since the s <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask whether he would be prepared to reconsider the view that he has put to the house that there is no difference between racial discrimination and other kinds of discrimination <e> <s> there are two areas of discrimination which have been outlawed in certain respects by law race discrimination and sex discrimination <e> <s> the noble lord the minister has said that there is no difference between sex discrimination and race discrimination in the context <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree that in relation to race discrimination there is a very real distinction in the sense that the police are and have been involved in incidents of race discrimination <e> <s> we have had riots where race discrimination has been involved <e> <s> in no other context such as sex discrimination or political discrimination to which the noble lord referred has this occurred <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to welcome the report of the select committee on youth training in the eec <e> <s> i welcome it for setting out the problems and experience of the different european countries and also for the important and coherent conclusions it reaches <e> <s> before commenting on the conclusions however i should like to underline how important it is for us in this country to understand the different attitudes to training in different countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say first of all that i am rather surprised at the criticism and some <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the very real disquiet that has been aroused by the criticisms of the inspectorate will the minister ask his right honourable friend whether he is prepared to make the same unequivocal reply which has just been given to this house but in a much fuller and more public way so that it may be generally appreciated and understood by all in education <e>", "<cs> my lords if i can now get my question in i should like to ask the minister whether he would not agree that it is much better to tackle the problem within the context of the existing schools along the lines that the noble lord lord avebury has suggested <e> <s> would not that be the best line of attack in the first place meeting long-term problems <e> <s> but would the noble earl the minister indicate whether in order to overcome short-term problems the government have any intention of providing special facilities for the conversion of girls with a-levels in arts subjects to take them over into the science and technological subjects <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that there have been major changes in the grants system but there has not been a major review which has promoted these changes <e> <s> would he not further agree that in view of the developments in higher education particularly the emphasis that is being given to part-time higher education it is really necessary for us to have a fundamental review of grants in order that aspects of part-time education are covered <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply and in particular for the reference to the spouse of an unemployed person <e> <s> is the minister aware of the very widespread disquiet that has been caused among voluntary organisations and advisory bodies based on their experience of the benefit that many married women have received in work and in training opportunities through the community programme and the fact that they are going to be debarred from such opportunites in the future <e> <s> is the minister aware that the equal opportunities commission has said that this rule might well be unlawful indirect marital discrimination under the sex discrimination act <e> <s> would it not be in the best interests of the country if government departments and agencies were to observe such acts of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that the scheme appears to have worked very well and smoothly in the past with the months qualification that is months unemployment out of a period of months can the noble lord tell us why the government have made this particular change <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the small percentage per cent <e> <s> do the government think that this change is worth all the aggravation that has been caused <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble earl the minister for that reply may i ask whether we can be assured that a broader and more flexible access to higher education as envisaged in the joint statement will become the basis for the governments projections relating to numbers and also for providing future resources <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for his reply <e> <s> however can he assure us that his honourable friend is fully aware of the very widespread concern that there is over widening the syllabus for a-level students <e> <s> is he also aware that there is a feeling that perhaps the present suggested as levels are likely to make the position more rigid rather than to widen the syllabus in the way it is hoped <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister assure us that the interests of the less academic pupils <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister think he is being rather complacent when he says that this is not a cut to the research councils particularly in view of the statement by the chairman of the advisory board for the research councils published by the des only this morning and when they have already indicated ways in which the money could have been spent <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the studies by the equal opportunities commission and other bodies which indicate that girls get less than a fair share of experience on the microcomputers in schools <e> <s> can he tell us if this side of the problem is taken into account in the teacher training programme and if not why not <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister indicate whether the green paper is likely to contain any proposals for introducing a comprehensive programme for continuing and part-time education along the lines of the recommendations from the ugc and the nab <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the major part of the activities of the student unions are concerned with the provision of welfare and social facilities along the lines which the noble lord lord grimond suggested in an earlier question <e> <s> that being so does it not mean that those officers on sabbatical leave are having the opportunity to develop very important business and managerial initiatives <e> <s> is that not to be welcomed by the benches opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister of the opinion that the kind of work that these children are doing is suitable for children of their age <e> <s> for example is he aware that the survey to which my noble friend referred indicated that something over per cent <e> <s> of the children had had accidents at work <e> <s> further did the noble lord see the recent television programme which showed children working at addenbrookes hospital cambridge doing the kind of work that i think many of us would think is unsuitable for children <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that it would be more appropriate to take the year as the base line for comparisons as that was the first year when this government had responsibility for setting the expenditure level <e> <s> will he also confirm that in real terms the universities recurrent grant for the year was million and in the current year it is million thus showing a substantial reduction <e>", "<cs> my lords like many of your lordships i want to deal with that part of the motion which concerns the arts <e> <s> i am prompted to take part in the debate because of the important contribution that the regions can make to the arts <e> <s> when we talk about the arts there is sometimes a tendency to concentrate on london but i am glad that that has not happened today <e> <s> i think that it is true to say that the arts nationally can flourish only if there is a strong base in the regions <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister feels that the three objectives to which he referred really do justice to this tremendous report from the noble lord lord swann and his committee to whom we are all very grateful <e> <s> for instance the first objective refers to the raising of standards in schools generally and while all of us would endorse that does the minister agree that if we are to raise standards for the ethnic groups this really implies positive action because it means special action for the ethnic groups in such places as the inner cities of bradford huddersfield and other places <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the director of the alvey programme in evidence to the house of lords select committee on science and education and training for new technologies said that there would need to be a growth of per cent <e> <s> per annum over the next decade in the pool of scientists and technologists to meet the needs of industry <e> <s> has the minister been assured that the figures that he has given us this afternoon will take that point into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to pay tribute to the noble lord lord gregson both for his chairmanship of this committee and for initiating the debate this afternoon <e> <s> it was a most valuable experience to sit on the committee under his chairmanship and to hear and to read the tremendous volume of evidence that was brought before us both orally and in written form because it raised a number of very important and essential factors of which we hope the government will take note <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that it is widely felt that the socketry skills in german artificial limb-making are superior to british skills <e> <s> since pain from an ill-fitting socket is one of the greatest difficulties which wearers of artificial limbs have to overcome does the minister not think that this matter is one of some urgency <e> <s> is he aware also that german artificial limbs are available under the <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult to follow the noble lord lord plummer of st marylebone with his detailed experience in local government and his knowledge of the london area <e> <s> so if he will forgive me i want to move up north to west yorkshire but unlike the noble lord lord bellwin i want to speak from the perspective of the metropolitan county as a whole and not just from the perspective of the largest city within the county <e>", "<cs> i really must take issue with the noble earl on two points he has made <e> <s> the first one is the reference to the fact from his point of view that the successor bodies are already there in order to take over these services <e> <s> the second is that the boroughs are able to take over the services <e> <s> the successor bodies are not there <e> <s> most of the services will be taken over by new bodies which have to be established and we hear from the noble earl that they will be established at the beginning of september <e> <s> but they will be the bodies who will take over the major services therefore it is not correct to say that they are already there <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support this amendment <e> <s> it seems perfectly reasonable to ask the government to give us a breakdown of the financial estimates which are contained in the bill <e> <s> the ministers opposite have indicated both at second reading and today what advantages financial and otherwise they think are going to be achieved by the passing of this bill <e> <s> surely therefore we are entitled to know how those sums are made up <e> <s> i would suggest to the noble lord that it is not an impossibility <e> <s> i hope the committee will forgive me if again i refer to the work of the select committee <e> <s> when the select committee visited west yorkshire in order to look at the engineering and the transport services we were so impressed by the services which we saw that we asked for a breakdown <e> <s> they were able to provide a break-down of the financial costs <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to all noble baronesses and noble lords who have taken part in the debate this afternoon on such a wide range of issues all of which were very pertinent to the motion which we were considering <e> <s> i welcome the equal participation of men and women in the debate because we were talking about equality between the sexes <e> <s> therefore it is very important that if we are successfully to deal with the problem both men and women should apply themselves to the problems of this subject and work together in a partnership understanding each others problems <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw my motion for papers <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord the minister can tell the committee what is to happen in those metropolitan county areas where the new structure plan has not received the authority of the minister <e> <s> for example the west yorkshire structure plan which has been with the minister for some time has not been approved by him <e> <s> it has been held up <e> <s> what will happen in such areas <e> <s> the structure plan has been crucial to the development of housing industry the preservation of the green belt and so on <e> <s> will there be a hiatus in areas such as those <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will take note of what his noble friend has said <e> <s> it is important that there should be as much liaison as possible on this whole question <e> <s> the noble lord lord elton did not really reply to my previous intervention <e> <s> i was referring to the updating of the west yorkshire structure plan which is still with the minister and which is awaiting ministerial approval <e> <s> it has been with him since last summer <e>", "<cs> the three sets of amendments which are before us seem to me in one way or another all to try to meet the objectives in the select committees report that is to keep the teams of experts together and to retain the services on a strategic basis <e> <s> the select committees report at paragraph reads <e>", "<cs> i come from the same parliamentary constituency as the noble lord lord ingrow and i take an entirely different view from him <e> <s> a lot was said in the earlier debate this afternoon and in previous debates about the efficiency of district councils compared with metropolitan counties <e> <s> i think that the facts speak for themselves <e> <s> if we look carefully at the facts i think it can be seen that a number of services are much more efficiently and effectively carried out at metropolitan county rather than district level <e> <s> i certainly think that that applies to trading standards <e>", "<cs> for all the reasons which have been expressed by a number of noble lords i should like to underline the importance of keeping the archive services together <e> <s> although my name does not appear on the amendment moved by the noble lord lord beloff he and i were instrumental in bringing together representatives of the archive profession from the metropolitan counties and i want to support the amendment that he has moved <e> <s> the framework which the noble lord outlined is largely that which is operating in west yorkshire at the moment <e> <s> however i would point out to your lordships that it took eight years for the west yorkshire metropolitan county to bring the districts together in order to establish a joint service between the metropolitan county and the district councils and then only four of the districts joined in the scheme <e> <s> it was not until that they all participated <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord molson in the name of the noble viscount lord ingleby <e> <s> the amendment is sponsored i remind the committee by those two noble lords and not by my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> secondly i remind the committee that the amendment has nothing to do with the glc though the glc has been called into question on two occasions <e> <s> the amendment is concerned with the metropolitan counties <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble lord lord campbell of alloway missed a very important point made by my noble friend lady fisher in relation to concessionary fares <e> <s> at present concessionary fares apply across the whole of a county <e> <s> if one of the district authorities decided to contract out of the passenger transport organisation and set up its own passenger <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble lord lord elton has not been more accommodating in his response because i was encouraged by the comments made by some of his noble friends on the other side <e> <s> it seemed to me that the noble viscount was absolutely right when he said that what we are seeking is a permanent solution to this problem <e> <s> of course we are seeking a permanent solution to the problem and it seemed to me that transferring the services as they are at the present time and i accept entirely what the minister said about the variety in the six different metropolitan counties to the residuary bodies would give us an opportunity to work out a permanent solution not a solution worked out in the short space of time between now and september <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but again i am not convinced by the remarks of the minister <e> <s> i am more concerned at seeing this service continue over the whole of the urban area <e> <s> as i said in my opening remarks there are difficulties which relate specifically to the urban areas and it is those difficulties which the metropolitan counties have begun to overcome <e>", "<cs> the amendment suggests that the service be transferred to the residuary body <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but obviously the minister was not listening to what i said <e> <s> i said that the service could be transferred as it is to the residuary body which would give us a full opportunity to determine then what the permanent solution should be <e> <s> i referred to the suggestion made by the noble lord lord beloff of the universities being involved as one possibility <e>", "<cs> i was not quite sure about the distinction which the noble earl the minister was making <e> <s> he referred to the products of education and training such as catering and hairdressing and then talked about the products of high technology and the setting up of an independent company <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble earl for what he has said <e> <s> in particular we are very pleased to know that consultations with the local authority associations are to take place on this matter <e> <s> it seems to me that this question of consistency is certainly an important one but i think that it would be more important within the area of an authority than between authorities <e> <s> my noble friend and i would like <e>", "<cs> in the light of that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> is the minister saying that all education activities and all education courses such as adult education courses should be exempt from vat under the bill <e> <s> that seemed to be what he was saying but i understand that this is not the case in all areas <e>", "<cs> i think that it is one of the problems <e> <s> the inspectors do give guidance and sometimes that guidance does not seem to be consistent <e> <s> however again i think all we can do is to read very carefully what the minister has said about this very complicated area <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i heard someone whisper west yorkshire which of course is the largest geographical county area of the six <e> <s> i must confess to the noble baroness that this problem has not been drawn to my attention though the extremities of some of the districts to the extremities of other districts is a considerable distance <e>", "<cs> most of the discussion so far seems to have concentrated on the experience of the london boroughs <e> <s> i would remind the committee that we are talking about the whole of the country and not just about the experience of the london boroughs and the glc <e> <s> if we take my own metropolitan county <e>", "<cs> may i add one further question to those posed by my noble friend <e> <s> what will happen to those schemes which have been partly funded by the european social fund and partly funded by the metropolitan counties <e> <s> will the successor bodies take over the responsibility for continuing those schemes <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> when the sex discrimination act was passed years ago it was preceded by a white paper which made it quite clear that in order to eliminate sex discrimination it would be necessary for a wide range of administrative and voluntary activity to take place to assist the proposed equal opportunities commission in eliminating sex discrimination and promoting equality of opportunity between the two sexes <e>", "<cs> as a member of the select committee on science and technology and its subcommittee which produced the report to which reference has been made i support the principle behind these two amendments but i should like to follow the noble lord lord sherfield and the noble lord lord campbell of alloway in asking the government to try to find some accommodation for these services <e> <s> the import of the select committees report is contained in paragraph where it says <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness tell me whether the signing of the convention is likely to take place before the nairobi conference in july <e> <s> also does she agree that it would give very great strength to the british delegation if the convention were so signed even if it had reservations attached to it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness bear in mind that the moral status of the british delegation which she will lead will be very much diminished if this convention is not ratified before the conference takes place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lady birk and to the noble lords lord beloff and lord campbell of alloway for their support <e> <s> it seems from the ministers response that we have convinced him that there is room for another look at this whole area <e> <s> therefore i am grateful to him also for saying that he will have a look at the language to see whether it can be made more specific perhaps to the satisfaction of members on both sides of the house <e> <s> it is a very complicated issue and i understand and appreciate some of the arguments that he put forward earlier in the debate <e> <s> therefore with his assurance that without commitment he will look at the matter i beg leave to withdraw my amendment at this stage with a view to our having a further discussion at third reading when i hope that there will be mutual satisfaction all round <e>", "<cs> my lords there seems to have been some confusion about the previous debates that we have had in the house <e> <s> certainly from this side of the house there has been a consistent demand that there should be central authorities within the metropolitan counties in order to co-ordinate both the strategic planning and other planning services <e> <s> i think that it is most inappropriate to say that it is only at this stage of the debate that we are now asking for this facility <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> i wonder whether he is aware that many careers officers and indeed some area manpower boards are very concerned that as the itecs become more income-generation biased and more concerned with the provision of commercial services the opportunities for many young people particularly the less qualified and disadvantaged groups are likely to decrease <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness the minister for that rather brief and unreassuring reply <e> <s> can she indicate why there has been a delay in issuing the report which i understand was to have been available in may <e> <s> is she aware that there is considerable disquiet in the artificial limb and appliance industry about the delay and about the possible effects of this report on the viability of the industry <e> <s> can she assure me that every effort will be made to speed up the publication of the report and to ensure that there will be adequate time to discuss possible recommendations for change with both the industry and the patient services <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us what immediate steps are being taken to ensure that <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble baroness for introducing this debate today <e> <s> i want to concentrate largely on continuing education but to pick up one or two of the points that the noble baroness lady seear made particularly in reference to women <e>", "<cs> like the noble and learned lord i saw the amendment only a few minutes ago <e> <s> unlike him i do not oppose it on the basis of principle but i wonder whether or not it will help <e> <s> there are one or two practical difficulties which i see in this amendment and i should like the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran to clarify them if possible <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment in the name of the right reverend prelate the lord bishop of london <e> <s> in doing so i very much regret that i am in complete opposition to the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale with whom i am usually in complete agreement <e> <s> but this is how it goes on these occasions <e> <s> he used the term ideology <e> <s> on this occasion i think we must be opposed ideologically <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank my noble friend lord jacques for introducing this debate and for the way in which he introduced it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble earl lord cranbrook for the very comprehensive way in which he has introduced this report <e> <s> as a member of the committee i should also like to thank him for his chairmanship <e> <s> i think that his lead in the way we approached this very wide and difficult subject was invaluable as were his penetrating analyses of some of the problems that we were facing <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to intervene on this amendment <e> <s> i feel however that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter is either unintentionally misleading the house or misunderstanding the situation <e> <s> surely we are referring now to a group of workers the shopworkers who when they undertook such work did so on the understanding that they would not be required to work on sundays and after pm <e> <s> this bill is now introducing provisions for such workers to be able to work on a sunday or after pm their situation is quite different to that of hotel workers and other groups of workers mentioned by the noble lord who undertook their particular work on the understanding and on the basis that they would be required to work on sunday <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> again the noble lord misunderstands the situation <e> <s> the amendment relates to people who currently are not required to work on sundays and after pm <e> <s> they might be tempted as my noble friend said to enter into such an arrangement <e> <s> he is suggesting that they should have the opportunity for such an arrangement to occur for a three-month period <e> <s> again as my noble friend has said there are many women among our shopworkers who would find it difficult to work on sunday and some might not realise until they were in the situation of having to work on a sunday that it was creating difficulties within the family <e>", "<cs> my lords as a member of the committee i too should like to thank the noble baroness lady serota for the very efficient way in which she chaired the committee and for her presentation of our report this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate the right reverend prelate the bishop of newcastle on his maiden speech and to congratulate him on his very apposite remarks relating to the northern end of the area we are considering and on the thoughtful suggestions and comments he made on the educational aspects <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the different retirement ages for men and women were altered during the last world war <e> <s> this was done first to encourage more women into the labour market and secondly to take account of the fact that at that time women were largely financially dependent on their husbands <e> <s> in the intervening years there have been tremendous changes in that <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to give the bill a qualified welcome <e> <s> my qualifications largely follow those of the noble baroness lady platt who succeeded me as chairman of the equal opportunities commission <e> <s> reading the bill it seems to me that it derives its inspiration from two sources first the european commission in its proceedings against the united kingdom and secondly the governments white paper of last year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure we are all grateful to the noble lord lord winstanley for putting this question this evening <e> <s> i am particularly grateful to him for the way in which he introduced his question putting it in the context of the wider problem of teenagers generally and not the narrow and very controversial problem of the under-s <e>", "<cs> i am rather surprised at some of the arguments which are being deployed in favour of this particular amendment <e> <s> it is true that clause really covers two aspects of the sex discrimination bill <e> <s> the first area is of course small employers and the second area is private households <e> <s> perhaps it is a pity that the two have been put together because there are different arguments in favour of the two sections <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> as has already been said it is difficult to know why <e>", "<cs> i must express my disappointment at the ministers response to this amendment <e> <s> i share with the noble baroness lady seear concern about indirect discrimination not being easily detected by either side of industry <e> <s> i also share with her some concern about the collusion which occurs from time to time <e> <s> one of the weaknesses of the sex discrimination act as was shown by the equal opportunities commission has been the inability to have collective agreements referred to the cac on a wide enough basis <e>", "<cs> will the minister give way <e> <s> i am sorry i did not fully elaborate on the case <e> <s> even after the commission had conducted its investigation the case still had to go through the industrial tribunal <e>", "<cs> i have some difficulty with the amendment from my noble friend on this matter and i also have some difficulty with the ministers response <e> <s> i understand the views of my noble friend in moving the amendment and i must say i share his concern about the growing level of insecurity for employees a level which has grown since when the equal opportunities commission presented its report <e>", "<cs> i am rather sorry that the noble baroness lady platt did not speak to her amendments because that would have given us an opportunity to assess the relative merits of the two sets of amendments <e>", "<cs> if the noble minister believes that this particular protection is falling into disuse or is likely to fall into disuse as the number of collective agreements increase would it not be a better approach to allow it to fall into disuse instead of amending the provision under the present act <e> <s> the noble baroness lady platt referred to the fear of the equal opportunities commission that if we were to remove the protection now it might lead to permanent night working and almost nothing but night working in the baking industry which would be a deterrent to many women joining the industry <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if i was misunderstood <e> <s> i certainly did not intend to imply that we should do nothing <e> <s> indeed i think my final remarks were concerned to extend the protection of women because i am well aware of the anomaly and some of the problems that have been caused <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble baroness in this amendment <e> <s> it is in line with what i have been saying in relation to the various debates we have had during the course of the day <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble baronesss amendment <e> <s> in doing so i must first apologise to the noble baroness and to the house for my absence when she moved the amendment <e> <s> the noble baroness will however forgive me i believe when i say that i was fulfilling a long-standing engagement dealing with equal opportunities <e> <s> i am sure that i would have agreed with the remarks of the noble baroness in support of an amendment the terms of which i support completely <e> <s> it is important to have an amendment such as this embodied in the bill not only for the reasons given by the noble baroness lady seear namely that there are a considerable number of employees who are outside the scope of organised trade unions and who are not always party to collective agreements but also because of the cowboy firms described by the noble and learned lord lord denning <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support both the terms of the motion before us today and the spirit in which it was moved by the noble baroness lady seear <e> <s> the present time should have been a good time for education <e> <s> the lean years of the pressure of student numbers are being lifted <e> <s> in the space of a decade and a half about a third of pupil numbers is going to decline <e> <s> this decline in numbers is passing at the present time through the - to -year-old age group and then it will move on to the university and higher education stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister can tell the house how the government expect to enhance the standards of research and teaching in universities and at the same time reduce the resources that are available to universities <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister agree that there are a great many women who would prefer part-time employment because of their domestic commitments but that they would also prefer to have the terms and conditions of that employment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also welcome the statement very warmly indeed both as a member of this house and as a former chairman of the equal opportunities commission which has been concerned about the provision since it was introduced in <e> <s> much of the research which has led to the proposed change has emanated from the eoc <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked the labour government and subsequent conservative governments that question on a number of occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the ministers response to the noble lords supplementary question would she be prepared to discuss with her right honourable friend in another place the importance of emphasising family planning as a vital ingredient in the prevention of disability <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may ask the minister a further question on this point which he has just raised <e> <s> while i welcome his statement and i shall look forward to reading the white paper i think he would agree that there have been varying degrees of success in the tvei schemes both across the range of ability and in the involvement of girls <e> <s> one of the disappointing aspects has been that <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> my reasons are the absolute opposite to those of the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes <e> <s> on many issues affecting women we tend to have similar views <e> <s> i very much regret that we do not on this occasion <e> <s> but there are two overriding reasons why we should support the amendment <e> <s> the first relates to equity between those families where there are children and those families where there are no children <e> <s> the noble baroness lady gardner referred to the fact that we are moving into a new system with family credit <e> <s> but we are not moving into a new system to the extent where we are getting rid of tax allowances <e> <s> the present family child benefit is an extension of the child tax allowance which was introduced in the early part of the century <e> <s> that was a recognition that those families where there were children had additional responsibilities and expenses <e> <s> it recognised the fact that the nation as a whole benefited by those children being brought up well and being well cared for <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i am rather surprised at this particular clause which draws a distinction at the age of <e> <s> there are many groups who will be affected <e> <s> noble lords and my noble friend lord ennals in particular have listed some of the groups that will be at risk <e> <s> it seems to me that those groups fall into two categories <e> <s> first there are the very vulnerable young people who need care <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to support the amendment in the name of my noble friend lady ewart-biggs <e> <s> she has outlined the difficulties arising from the low pay of the majority of women workers and in particular the low pay of part <e>", "<cs> my lords as there is a later amendment in my name and in the names of the noble baronesses lady seear and lady gardner and the noble lord lord henderson of brompton i should like to speak in this debate to this amendment because i believe this amendment will be welcomed on all sides of the house <e> <s> in the house a number of us particularly welcome this amendment because we have been involved in the problems arising from the discriminatory nature of ica since its introduction in <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment in the name of my noble friend <e> <s> it seems that the minister does not understand some of the implications for women who undertake part-time work <e> <s> there are all kinds of reasons why a woman may want to continue with employment even though her children are small <e> <s> one is that she may want to retain an interest in employment so that she does not lose touch with her job or profession <e> <s> she may want to move into full-time employment later <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> may i take it that the proposals put forward by the two sides will be favourably considered by the government <e> <s> is the noble baroness aware that the competitive position of university teachers and lecturers has deteriorated over the past three years in relation to the position in industry and even in other spheres of the public sector because the university pay settlements have been at a much lower level than those in the private sector and in the public sector <e> <s> is this a situation which the government believe the country can afford to tolerate with its consequent brain-drain of people from the universities to industry and even to other countries <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord has established the size of the problem will he consider asking the manpower services commission whether they will devote some of their resources to establishing better aid for adult illiteracy because as the noble baroness indicated it is based on a lot of part-time and voluntary effort <e> <s> furthermore is the noble lord aware that many of the volunteers are somewhat frustrated by the lack of a proper structure <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate is not about freedom of speech in universities and institutes of higher education <e> <s> in this house as we are aware all of us are committed to freedom of speech and the debate is about whether or not this clause is the best means of achieving freedom of speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble baroness lady platt in her request to the government that they should make a clear statement about their intention to legislate to remove the inequality in retirement ages between men and women <e> <s> i should like also to support my noble friend on the front bench in asking the government to state their wider strategy in relation to the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for his reply which is encouraging to a certain extent <e> <s> perhaps i may ask him whether he is aware for example of the damage that has been done to the credibility of the advertising standards authority which is responsible for overseeing advertising codes by the inconsistent rules governing tobacco advertising particularly in relation to sponsorship <e> <s> can he assure the house that he will take into account the points that have been put to the department by the advertising standards authority on this matter <e>", "<cs> i support my noble friend in this amendment <e> <s> while i appreciate the remarks made by the noble baroness lady gardner i would remind her that in moving the amendment my noble friend talked about safety standards <e> <s> for the life of me i cannot understand why we should be prepared to permit the export of goods from this country which do not meet the domestic markets safety standards <e> <s> that is especially so in the context of the common market <e> <s> i may be prepared to concede that there are some circumstances when such goods may be exported although not unsafe goods but we are thinking in terms of a single market in europe by the early s <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i wonder whether he will comment on another aspect of the time schedule <e> <s> he talked at length about the time that it has taken to bring about agreement among the various parties on the employees side from until i believe he said <e> <s> he did not tell us the extent of the agreement which has been reached now <e> <s> will he compare that time with the time it has taken successive secretaries of state to come forward with proposals for amending the burnham machinery <e> <s> in the then secretary of state said that he was coming forward with proposals which would involve all the parties concerned <e> <s> it is now and no proposals have been forthcoming from a secretary of state <e> <s> how long must we wait for permanent machinery <e>", "<cs> i was not talking about the career structure of the teachers but the machinery for negotiating that <e>", "<cs> on all sides of the committee today we have been agreed that it is a good thing that teachers pay and conditions should be taken together and that they should be negotiated together <e> <s> the secretary of state is not the employing body <e> <s> it is the local education authorities that will be the employing body and will therefore have to enforce the employment contract covering conditions of service as well as pay <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever might have been said from different parts of the house the fact remains that there is a lot of common ground among your lordships <e> <s> the right reverend prelate the bishop of birmingham said that the bill was not concerned with abortion <e> <s> he said that he himself was not opposed to abortion as such and that in certain circumstances it was justifiable <e> <s> i think all of us would agree with him that we want to see fewer late abortions and that is common ground among all members of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the apparently special nature of the limestone being quarried in this area which makes the area one of particular interest and beauty can the minister tell us what steps are being taken to try to establish the extent of the reserves of pure limestone and whether research is being undertaken into possible substitutes <e>", "<cs> my lords we have heard many different excuses from the other side of the house as to why the various amendments put forward from these benches and from the alliance benches <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the motion of my noble friend <e> <s> i must however first of all express my apologies to the house and to the secretary of state as i may not be in my place at the end of the debate <e> <s> i am afraid that a long-standing appointment in yorkshire means that i have soon to be on a train that will take me to an area where unemployment is perhaps a greater problem than it is in some parts of london and the south-east <e>", "<cs> my lords there are even men over who have retired early who would welcome a job until they receive a state pension <e> <s> of course there are also women who are seeking jobs <e> <s> the minister did not mention them <e> <s> many married women would willingly take up a job but they cannot find a job within a reasonable geographical area <e> <s> the figures do not include those who have been removed or persuaded to stop claiming benefit as a result of the introduction and the difficulties of restart <e> <s> the interview and the form are off-putting to many people so we are talking about the minimum number of people <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that despite the criticism in the mccoll report of the artificial limb manufacturing industry nevertheless one of the british limbs namely endolite by blatchford is at the leading edge of this technology and is being much sought after by many countries including america and germany <e> <s> indeed steps are being taken in those countries to emulate the techniques <e> <s> will she assure the house that any future organisation of the industry will not be so fragmented as to inhibit the continuation of research and development <e>", "<cs> my lords like the first two speakers i welcome the report as a positive and a realistic approach to the administration and management of our universities <e> <s> i think it is important to recognise that we are talking about administration and management and not the academic quality of the universities <e>", "<cs> my lords in response to my noble friend lord fletcher the minister said that this is not a question of exemption but of how fees are to be met <e> <s> can she explain what she means by that <e> <s> does it mean that the government are prepared to accept responsibility for paying the fees of part-time students who at the present time are paying them themselves out of taxed income <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell the house when the consultative document will be available <e> <s> is she aware that if it is not available in the very near future some of these institutions may be bankrupt before it is <e>", "<cs> my lords can the secretary of state tell us whether the area manpower boards keep the statistics to which the question refers <e> <s> if monitoring is undertaken at that level is it not possible for the national figures to be made available <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that between now and the majority of our unversities will be involved in the process of cutting back on their departments and on their staffs <e> <s> can the noble baroness tell me how this can be reconciled with the policy for widening access contained in the white paper when no additional funding is to be available <e> <s> i ask that because widening access to differently qualified people means that more money will be required for in-service training and different facilities for teaching university students <e> <s> secondly <e>", "<cs> my lords i conclude with that one question <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to the house and in particular to my noble friend lord mcintosh for not being in my place at the opening of the debate <e> <s> i was fulfilling a long-standing educational engagement downstairs which had a threefold purpose <e> <s> the first was to thank the noble baroness lady seear for her years service as president of hillcroft college <e> <s> the second purpose was to celebrate the diamond jubilee of that college and the third purpose was to launch an appeal for funds <e> <s> i think those are all very relevant to the debate today so i hope i may be forgiven <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness be surprised to learn that i also agree with my noble friend lord hatch on this point <e> <s> will she tell us whether steps are in hand not only to obtain statistics on our aid to these countries but also to monitor the effect of the special projects for women <e> <s> does she agree that if we are to give the most effective aid to these countries it is important to monitor and in the light of the monitoring perhaps to adjust our assistance <e>", "<cs> is the minister aware that sir mark richmond the chairman of the committee of vice-chancellors and principals in welcoming the report of the royal society said that the report also showed that scientists leave because there is no longer any reliable career structure in the academic world <e> <s> he went on to say that this combined with the universities increasing reliance on short-term contracts drives these talented men and women to countries where their expertise will be more greatly valued <e> <s> will she comment on that <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the secretary of state not agree that many women in order to obtain the flexibility that might help them with their domestic commitments have sacrificed jobs which contained protection adequate pension rights and maternity rights and have now had to forfeit those <e> <s> would the noble lord look at the conditions under which those women now work with particular reference to those who do home work <e>", "<cs> i must thank the minister for his response and in particular for sharing my concern about the need to extend the benefits of the channel tunnel throughout the country <e> <s> having said that however i am disappointed at his response to my amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin by congratulating the noble lord on his maiden speech <e> <s> his first contribution to opinion in this house has whetted our appetite for more <e> <s> all of us appreciate the fact that he has been able to bring his own knowledge and expertise to the debate and we look forward to hearing him again <e> <s> perhaps the best thing that we can wish him is that he has a similar though different as his contribution today has exemplified distinguished public career to that which his father had before him <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister satisfied that these new hospitals no doubt containing admirable high technology and catering largely for acute cases satisfactorily replace some of the smaller hospitals which catered largely for long-stay elderly and handicapped patients <e> <s> in the absence of adequate care in the community will he consider this aspect of hospital service <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support my noble friends amendment <e> <s> last week in committee i moved an amendment which had the full support as i said then of the yorkshire and humberside regional association <e> <s> both sides of industry all political parties involved in local government in yorkshire and humberside were represented in that voice of support <e> <s> i am not moving the amendment again <e> <s> however part of it is covered by my noble friends amendment in the sense that if we are to develop the industries in all parts of the country i speak in particular for the industries in the yorkshire and humberside region it is essential that we have facilities in this country comparable with those that already exist in france <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great pleasure to follow the noble baroness lady blatch and to congratulate her on her maiden speech <e> <s> it is always refreshing to have a new voice in your lordships house <e> <s> today we have heard two such voices <e> <s> both have acquitted themselves well <e> <s> one should expect the noble earl to do coming as he does from a distinguished political family and the noble baroness brings a distinguished record in local government to the discussions in the house <e> <s> i am sure that i speak for all of us when i say that we hope to hear from both of them on many occasions in the future <e>", "<cs> in my few remarks i want to follow along the lines of the noble earl <e> <s> i wish

sherfield for introducing the debate and to endorse much of what he has said particularly the welcome that he gave to the governments response in cmnd <e> <s> in relation to restructuring central machinery for government policy on science <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for the way in which he chaired the committee and for his very excellent introduction of the report this <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us what steps his department is taking to try to co-ordinate the closure of hospitals or hospital wards with the provision of facilities within the community as the latest report from the national audit office seems to suggest that there is a time lag <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that there is a significant difference between the kind of education offered to mature students in universities and that in adult colleges such as newbattle college <e> <s> will he agree that in addition to providing an education for such students or an introduction to higher education the colleges make a substantial contribution to the development of education for mature students generally <e>", "<cs> i am very disappointed at the ministers response <e> <s> it is the same response that we had on second reading from his noble friend the leader of the house <e> <s> we know that the equal opportunities commission has gone through the consultative process and is about to put forward recommendations to the government for amending the sex discrimination act <e> <s> we know that one of those recommendations is likely to be that the government should include the sex discrimination act in a provision similar to section of the race relations act <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment <e> <s> in doing so i find the governments position very difficult to understand <e> <s> i understand the position of some members of the house such as the noble baroness lady blatch who is completely opposed to the principle of contract compliance <e> <s> i understand with some difficulty the arguments of the noble lord lord beloff <e> <s> i believe his speech was an indication of the fact that discrimination against women is not completely understood <e> <s> it is the deep ingrained attitudes about women which bring about the discrimination it is not deliberate discrimination <e> <s> the noble lord described pregnancy as a natural disability <e> <s> pregnancy is part of normal life for the majority of women but so is earning a living and having a career <e> <s> we have to facilitate both within our policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i said insignificant <e>", "<cs> my lords yesterday the government benches made much play on what they said was the complacency on these benches about education <e> <s> i thought that my noble friends lord morton of shuna and lord callaghan of cardiff had effectively dealt with that criticism <e> <s> however it seems that it might continue today <e> <s> therefore let me say that there has never been complacency in my party about the extent or quality of our educational provisions <e> <s> there has certainly never been complacency about the vast majority of our young people who leave school with no progression into further and higher education <e> <s> to show concern does not mean that we have to deny what is good in the system <e> <s> it does not mean that we must acquiesce in the passage of a bill which seems intent upon destroying the whole structure of our educational system <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to take up too much of my time talking about public passenger transport <e> <s> however i should like to make one or two remarks following references made by my noble friend lord underhill in his excellent speech introducing the debate <e> <s> research increasingly shows that women rely more on public transport than men do <e> <s> that of course applies in households where there is no private car <e> <s> contrary to many peoples impressions as has been said this afternoon some per cent <e> <s> of households have no access to a private car <e> <s> even in families where there is a car and both partners have a driving licence the male member of the household usually has first claim on the car <e> <s> the noble lord lord teviot reminded us that only one woman in three has a driving licence <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> which stands in my name also refers to resources <e> <s> however it points to the fact that a responsibility will be placed on head teachers to carry out the national curriculum <e> <s> my amendment would add the words <e>", "<cs> i rise to move amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i must say that i find myself in some difficulty because i have a group of amendments linked with that amendment and a further group which comes later <e> <s> but as they are all listed together <e>", "<cs> i beg your lordships pardon <e> <s> i wish to speak to amendment no <e> <s> i quite appreciate that i cannot move it at this stage <e> <s> the difficulty is having to speak to amendments which are so diverse in their nature <e>", "<cs> i support the principle that lies behind the three amendments <e> <s> one of the difficulties we face is that if the government insist that the curriculum shall be so confined and prescriptive there will be moves to extend it <e> <s> that will be due to the feeling that if a subject is not mentioned among the core or foundation subjects it will not be taught <e> <s> there is scope within the range of foundation subjects to cover the issues before us <e> <s> no one will be sure about them if they are not now mentioned in the bill <e>", "<cs> will the minister tell the committee who will determine whether paper and pencil testing is part of that assessment <e>", "<cs> the same principle applies to clause c where it says <e>", "<cs> surely my noble friend has put his finger on a very real deficiency in the bill <e> <s> clause says <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to follow the noble lord lord mancroft and to have the opportunity on behalf of the house to congratulate him on his maiden speech <e> <s> i should also like to offer my congratulations to the noble earl lord lytton on his maiden speech <e> <s> it is very difficult for members of your lordships house to make a non-controversial contribution in the form of a maiden speech <e> <s> i think i detected a little controversy in both of the maiden speeches this afternoon <e> <s> perhaps we can put that down to the dimension of youth which was certainly more visible from our two maiden speakers than on average in your lordships house <e> <s> we look forward to hearing both of them in the future <e>", "<cs> the minister has given us a very fine treatise on what undertaking financial delegation could imply <e> <s> but i do not think he has his feet on the ground he is not aware of some of the problems that are likely to occur in cities like bradford for instance a city which has difficulty in recruiting enough people to act as governors of schools in the first place <e> <s> if there is difficulty in recruiting an adequate number of governors the responsibilities that the minister has outlined which will be imposed upon governors in a short period of time are not likely to encourage people to come forward <e>", "<cs> following the remarks of my noble friend if the government accept responsibility for training and agree to the amendment of my noble friend so that they will be accepting complete responsibility for the training of governors will they also bear in mind the kind of problems that i mentioned in my previous intervention namely that in some lea districts there will be a greater need for training than in others <e> <s> in other words in areas in which there is a substantial proportion of professional people on a board of governors the same amount of training will not be required as would be required by a group of people on a board of governors who come from different ethnic communities <e> <s> will the minister take that point on board <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend responds i wonder whether the minister could comment on another situation <e> <s> in some districts the leas are under a tvei scheme for instance and they have teachers who would not necessarily cover just one school <e> <s> the resource is shared by a number of schools <e> <s> how does the noble lord see that kind of appointment being handled under financial delegation <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> there are two groups of people whom it is difficult to <e>", "<cs> i am rather surprised by the ministers response to this series of amendments which i certainly support <e> <s> does the minister agree that even if a head teacher is a member of the board of governors he or she may have a particular viewpoint based upon his or her professional standing and therefore should be consulted as of right as a head teacher <e> <s> that is a point that ought to be borne in mind <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment of my noble friend <e> <s> i know that the draft consultative document discusses this matter and leaves it open to local authorities to determine whether or not they will delegate such responsibility <e> <s> i note that it says nothing in the scheme of financial delegation should restrict leas freedom to issue such directions within the framework of the act or to maintain existing community provision on school premises <e> <s> i think the sentiments there are fine but they are in a draft consultative document <e> <s> i prefer <e>", "<cs> my name is also appended to this amendment and i should like to support it <e> <s> there are two aspects of equal opportunities policies in which local education authorities are involved <e> <s> one is the educational side and under the sex discrimination act local education authorities have a general duty to ensure that there is provision of educational facilities without discrimination for both boys and girls <e> <s> it is important that the work that has been done in that sphere should be carried on by schools which have been given financial responsibility <e> <s> the second aspect is the employment one and again many education authorities have drawn up equal employment policies for the staff in their educational institutions <e>", "<cs> is not the noble and learned lord overlooking one simple fact i refer to the majority of members of the committee who have spoken this evening which is that such people have had many years in which to gain their experience <e> <s> when one talks about student representation one is in an entirely different situation <e> <s> students remain in the college for a period in the region of three years they are not likely to be appointed during their first year which means that even if they come in during their second year they will probably have only two years during which they can represent the students in the institution <e> <s> that will not give them much opportunity to gain confidence <e> <s> the additional representation would help one to support the other <e>", "<cs> i support the amendments and i shall address particularly that part of the amendment which deals with continuing education <e> <s> like the noble lord lord perry i expressed my disappointment at the second reading of the bill that continuing education did not seem to feature to any considerable degree <e> <s> the value of the two amendments before us is that they place continuing education as a central objective of higher education in this country <e> <s> they give continuing education a statutory basis <e>", "<cs> i am disappointed at the ministers response <e> <s> as i indicated the womens aid groups feel that it would be much more helpful if women in refuges could be exempted <e> <s> i know that womens aid centres will not be responsible for a collective community charge <e> <s> however i think that we have to accept that most of the care and responsibility for taking the women to the dhss telling them what to say and helping them throughout rests with the womens aid centres <e> <s> the very fact that there is an additional burden on them in the form of the community charge is a burden both on the women and the womens aid centres <e>", "<cs> then surely the minister is meeting the objective of the amendment <e> <s> the amendment asks for exemption while the person is in that refuge <e> <s> if the minister is now telling me that while the woman is there she will not be required to register and meet the community charge then the point is covered <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his remarks <e> <s> i should like to have the opportunity to read very carefully everything that he has said in order to see just how much difference there may be between us <e>", "<cs> on those grounds i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support this group of amendments <e> <s> as members of the committee have already said and as i indicated on second reading this clause sits ill in the present bill which is intended to impose an individual charge and not a collective family charge <e> <s> yet in this clause we have collective and several liability which places a spouse in a position of responsibility for any debts imposed by the other spouse <e>", "<cs> can the minister also explain why he feels so confident in saying that this clause is an attempt to help those non-earning spouses <e> <s> he has indicated that the intention of the clause is to put the responsibility to pay on the earning spouse but the clause does not say that <e> <s> a great many women in this country are concerned that they will be responsible not only for their own community charge but for their husbands as well <e>", "<cs> my lords as a member of the inquiry committee i welcome the opportunity for the house to debate this report <e> <s> i should also like to pay tribute to the noble lord lord nelson for his patience and thoroughness in guiding the committee through the large bulk of evidence during the course of our proceedings <e>", "<cs> my lords in returning to the report on the integration of disabled people i should like to begin by adding my thanks to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for the way in which he chaired the committee and also for his very comprehensive introduction to the report this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i share the concern of my noble friend <e> <s> her motion refers to the high <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister can assure us that the two very bland paragraphs on pages and on training and research are not the only responses that the government are going to make to the house of lords select committee on priorities in medical research <e> <s> these two paragraphs do not in any way address themselves to the recommendations of that select committee report <e>", "<cs> my lords i enter this debate as a ratepayer in the metropolitan district of bradford <e> <s> i am not a native of bradford but i think that i can claim to know the area reasonably well having divided my leisure and shopping activities for most of my life between the rival cities of bradford and leeds <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell us what criteria the secretary of state applies when determining his views on reorganisation <e> <s> secondly will he inform us whether the secretary of state hears in mind the effect on reorganisation when <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister reply to the second part of my question <e> <s> it was this <e> <s> does the secretary of state take into account the effect of opting out on both sixth forms and sixth-form colleges where there are falling rolls <e>", "<cs> i wish to put forward another aspect of the amendment <e> <s> it is important in the light of the encouragement given to more families to take out investments <e> <s> the amendment would be particularly important to women because often a family investment is taken out by the husband or in the joint names of husband and wife <e> <s> in such cases the husband would be regarded as being the principle investor and would have the right to attend meetings of shareholders <e> <s> even though the husband might appoint his wife as a proxy she would not have the right to speak under the present law <e>", "<cs> my lords if there is a shortage of sites for ctcs and no shortage of teachers of technology as the minister said what steps are the government taking to ensure that those resources go into state schools in the urban areas which the ctcs are supposed to service <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for that reply although it does not throw very much light on the present situation <e> <s> is he aware that morale in the universities is at art all-time low and that a near crisis situation exists <e> <s> is he further aware that it is the government and only the government which can take steps to break the deadlock by providing the necessary resources to fund an adequate increase in academic salaries which would restore them to their level from which they have declined by per cent <e> <s> in relation to the average earnings index <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister appreciate that although the universities are technically the employers in the last resort the funding must come from government <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate is very timely from many points of view as my noble friend lord stewart indicated in his opening remarks <e> <s> the difficulties already encountered in the supply of teachers are due to many factors <e> <s> demographic trends not only affect the number of children in schools but also the source of supply for recruiting new teachers into the profession <e> <s> a further difficulty is the introduction of the national curriculum and that along with the new general certificate of secondary education places greater demands not only on the number of teachers but also on the in-service training which those teachers require <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall intervene but briefly in the debate for two reasons <e> <s> first i am not in favour of the purpose behind the bill and secondly i do not think that it is the right vehicle for a decision of this magnitude to be made <e> <s> on the substance of the bill i shall not say very much <e> <s> the principles and the philosophy as well as the medical aspects of <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that some near market research is in the public interest <e> <s> if that research is not being conducted by the industry will the minister assure us that the government will continue to fund such near market research <e>", "<cs> i said that we were moving away from the interpretation of words but that does not seem to have been the case <e> <s> there has been some difference of emphasis on what we are seeking <e> <s> i must say having for the past years been involved in this whole question of promoting equality of women alongside men that i agree completely with the noble baroness lady seear <e> <s> we are not seeking quotas <e> <s> we are seeking a positive policy to promote opportunities for women <e>", "<cs> what about women <e>", "<cs> by proxy <e>", "<cs> i am very disappointed with the ministers response <e> <s> i think that he and the noble lord lord mottistone made very heavy weather of the question of abuse of shareholders rights <e> <s> as i indicated i believe that it is possible to cope with any such situation <e> <s> a proxy shop as the noble lord lord mottistone put it would obviously go to all shareholders <e> <s> if one made it clear that one person could speak for perhaps only two or three proxies the situation could be contained and the problems which the noble lord mentioned could be mitigated <e> <s> therefore i feel that that issue has been exaggerated in the arguments against the amendment <e>", "<cs> the response to the consultation represents the <e>", "<cs> my lords i start by adding my congratulations to my noble friend if i may so describe him in the context of our mutual membership of the council of bradford university the right reverend prelate the bishop of bradford <e> <s> it was good to hear his wise counsel in our chamber this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with noble lords who have expressed concern about the contents of this bill <e> <s> it is a concern which reflects not only their own feelings but also the general concern that has been expressed throughout the country by individuals and a wide range of organisations <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to apologise for my absence <e> <s> i was upstairs in a select committee and your lordships galloped ahead faster than i had anticipated <e> <s> as my noble friend has indicated this is a different amendment but its purpose is the same as those tabled at earlier stages <e> <s> it is to bring about an increase in the number of women directors <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down can he say why it is inappropriate for the sex discrimination act to apply to the appointment of directors when it is not inappropriate that it should apply to government appointees <e>", "<cs> i support this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords like many noble lords who have taken part in the debate this afternoon i too am committed to the concept of a united europe <e> <s> however my detailed interest stems from my membership of your lordships sub-committee c of the european select committee <e> <s> that is the committee concerned with social affairs <e> <s> it stems also from my earlier experience as a member of the european advisory committee on equality between the sexes <e> <s> this afternoon therefore i shall be concentrating on the social implications of <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may follow my two noble friends and other noble lords and take the committee on a geographical tour of the country from stoke newington to wales and from fulham up to the yorkshire moors and dales <e> <s> this matter affects not only areas like london but all the large industrial towns in our country <e> <s> most of them have reservoirs and areas of land which are well used in the vicinity by local inhabitants <e> <s> in yorkshire one thinks of the washburn valley which provides a real amenity to the citizens of leeds and bradford <e> <s> it is not part of the yorkshire dales national park but is nevertheless not only an amenity but a recreational area where young and old can come to enjoy the countryside and begin to <e>", "<cs> not only will the bill if passed unamended weaken the protection that we have already under the act but the very fact that the bill is before us and is being considered weakens the present arrangements that have been operating under the act <e> <s> the national trust and a whole range of other associated conservation bodies are already concerned about their relationship with the water authorities under the threat of the bill <e>", "<cs> in relation to amendment no <e> <s> did the minister say that he would look at the possibility of including the word conserve in the code or in the bill itself <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords as we have already heard this afternoon there is a different pattern in the polytechnics from that in the universities <e> <s> that is especially so in relation to the numbers of part-time students the numbers on sandwich short and modular courses and the types of entry qualifications into higher education <e> <s> nevertheless it is remarkable that we hear and underline the fact that standards are comparable <e> <s> that that is so is a strength of our higher education system and something that should be preserved so long as the polytechnics are not regarded as a cheap and inferior alternative to universities a sentiment which i fear still pervades many quarters <e>", "<cs> if it should be the duty of every local authority to take all such steps as it considers appropriate for keeping itself informed <e>", "<cs> i am very disappointed in the ministers response <e> <s> when i raised the question on metering on second reading he said that i had made the mistake of linking it with the privatisation of water <e> <s> it is quite clear from the discussion which has taken place that there will be an increase in metering as a result of the privatisation of water and the <e>", "<cs> i should like to say to the noble lord lord trafford that i pointed out in my comments that a trial had been undertaken in wakefield which had shown that a family of four was likely to have to pay an increase of per annum for its water bill and a family of five would have to pay an increase of <e>", "<cs> my lords the contribution of the noble viscount lord cross is indicative of the very wide-ranging debate that we have already had <e> <s> like other noble lords i am grateful to my noble friend for introducing the subject <e> <s> all of us in your lordships house experience transport problems in london as we struggle to get into parliament day after day <e> <s> for some there is the struggle too to get home again in the early hours of the morning <e> <s> but there are problems in other areas <e> <s> in the north of england there is a feeling that the balance of attention between the north and the south is in favour of the south <e> <s> therefore it it perhaps not surprising to your lordships that i intend to talk about the north and the problems of yorkshire <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister assure us that the guidance notes which he mentioned will provide sufficient scope for the voluntary conservation societies which are perhaps not represented on the advisory bodies to make their views adequately known <e> <s> there is some concern among the voluntary organisations particularly those which have representation on the consultative committees at present that the umbrella organisations mentioned in the consultative document will not provide sufficient scope for individual bodies that may have a particular point of view which it is important should be made known to express themselves <e> <s> therefore this would need to be covered by the guidance notes to ensure that these organisations have some means of directly making their views known <e> <s> can the minister assure us on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may clarify the point <e> <s> i do not need assuring on that point because i was perfectly aware from the consultative document that that would be so <e> <s> but not all of the organisations that are currently represented on the committees will necessarily be represented on the new advisory committees <e> <s> we wish to have an assurance that there will be some means by which they can make their views known even if it is only through representation but an adequate channel representing their views other than membership of the committees <e> <s> that will need to be specified quite clearly in the guidance notes which the minister mentioned in his speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i too support the amendment notwithstanding what the noble lord lord crickhowell said <e> <s> i underline how valuable his assurances have been <e> <s> nevertheless the fact that the yorkshire water authority could put round a paper showing the kind of bodies that should be represented on the rracs which left out the voluntary conservation bodies is an indication of how insecure their position could be <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a very difficult debate <e> <s> it seems now to have concentrated on amendment no <e> <s> in the name of my noble friend lady nicol and others <e> <s> i should like to support what has been said on this amendment <e> <s> it seems that there is an omission from government amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> however i wish to support two of the amendments put forward by my noble friend lord mcintosh of haringey <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the publicly stated opinion of the secretary of state that it is better to introduce management changes into the national health service without pilot experiments <e>", "<cs> are we not in danger of creating a great many anomalies with the proposal put forward by the government <e> <s> as my noble friend has said there are provisions in the bill for a list of very sensitive posts to be agreed by the secretary of state <e> <s> however we are concerned with the professionalism of people who are employed in local government <e> <s> people in other professions also often find themselves in very sensitive situations giving advice and guidance to clients but the bill selects just one group and withdraws some of their civic rights <e> <s> as a result a number of anomalies could be created <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friends amendment and at the same time attempt to elicit more information from the minister <e> <s> the restrictions which the bill would impose on some controlled companies are causing a number of them to look at their structure and decide whether they need to remain a controlled company and whether they should become an influenced company <e> <s> they will need plenty of time to change their constitution and structure if they are to become an influenced company <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend decides what to do about the amendment can the minister assure me that the specific questions that i posed will be included in the consultation document <e> <s> can the minister say whether the process of consultation will be completed before we come to the report stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> but the noble lord said that a consultation document would be issued within the next month <e> <s> will the consultation document cover the specific points i put to him in my earlier remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale in congratulating the noble lord lord henley on the new responsibilities which he has taken on <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble lord lord allen for his very comprehensive introduction of this report and also for the way in which he steered the committee of which i was privileged to be a member through this very complicated and difficult subject <e>", "<cs> my lords as this matter has been discussed during the past years does the minister agree that it would not be a hasty decision on the part of the government <e> <s> when he says that it is unlikely that a decision will be effected before the end of the century is he talking about the commencement or the end of the phasing in period <e>", "<cs> i should like to support these two amendments <e> <s> i find the ministers response to them very disappointing and i may say very short-sighted <e> <s> it is the governments policy as the noble baroness lady seear indicated to encourage more married women into employment <e> <s> because of the demographic changes it will be absolutely necessary for employers to encourage married women to remain in employment <e>", "<cs> i recognise the difficulties which the minister has outlined in publishing a list of not only primary but also subsidiary legislation which might have discriminatory effects <e> <s> however i should have hoped he would be more sympathetic to the objective of this amendment <e> <s> my noble friend lady turner said that she was not wedded to the wording of the amendment <e> <s> i think that what we need is some inclusion in the present bill that not only ensures that those parts of section that are related to employment and training will be eliminated but also that the government will have placed upon themselves a responsibility to take account of and amend other discriminatory legislation <e>", "<cs> i disagree with my noble friend lord stoddart of swindon <e> <s> the amendment is not about whether women should be allowed to go down the mines <e> <s> at present there are circumstances in which some women go down the mines <e> <s> they may be professional women doctors nurses and even geologists <e> <s> however the amendment relates to whether women would be <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that rather complacent reply <e> <s> however can he tell the house how he reconciles it with the concern that has been expressed by other bodies for example by local authorities <e> <s> some local authorities are asking for salaries to be based on actual costs instead of averages <e> <s> the audit commission has suggested that there will be significant job losses <e> <s> a survey of the teachers organisations has indicated that at least per cent <e> <s> of secondary schools will lose out <e> <s> those concerns do not seem to fit in with the ministers bland reply <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the minister will acknowledge that it is not only a question of the number of children and hence the number of teachers but the grading of those teachers <e> <s> has the minister any solution as regards the teachers who have grown older and are on a higher salary point as my noble friend indicated or who have special responsibility <e> <s> what are such schools to do <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister believes that this problem is being over-exaggerated and that there are no problems with the introduction of the national curriculum would he comment on the report this weekend of the remarks of the head of hmi mr eric bolton who said <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that it is still a truism to say that women are central to the family well-being <e> <s> that has been part of our culture for a long time and is likely to remain so despite the enormous pace of change within society <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that my noble friend lady turner was referring to black spots in different parts of the country and asked what specific measures the government will take to deal with those difficult and intensive problems <e> <s> will he please answer that quesion <e>", "<cs> my lords i too must begin with an apology to the house and to the minister which i have already conveyed to her <e> <s> i need to catch a train to yorkshire unfortunately there is no sleeping car facility on my line <e>", "<cs> my lords i spent last weekend at a consultation on population changes and employment organised by the st williams foundation of york that is the northern equivalent of st georges house windsor <e> <s> i mention that for two reasons <e> <s> the first is because it is relevant to this debate <e> <s> many of the issues that have been raised this afternoon were raised during that weekend <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply although i shall have to read it in <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said that he cannot anticipate what the chancellor of the exchequer may be saying shortly <e> <s> however i wonder whether he saw the report concerning one of his former colleagues edwina currie who was speaking on this matter some weeks ago <e> <s> she is reported to <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us what provision will be made for the children of civil servants <e>", "<cs> my lords as a member of sub-committee c which undertook this inquiry i would like to thank the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for the way in which he introduced the report and for outlining the reasons behind the committees approach and recommendations <e> <s> the charter is not a binding document it is largely a statement of intent on broad principles relating to the social rights of workers within the community <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that response <e> <s> does she agree with the report that demands are increasing on both adult education services as a consequence of changes in demography and the changes in government policy relating to <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the report of the chief inspector is to the secretary of state

paragraph which refers quite specifically to the youth and adult services <e> <s> that paragraph describes the accommodation for that service as <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> i sympathise with the noble earl lord halsbury in the moving of his amendment <e> <s> in particular i sympathise with the view that he was advancing that we would like to take this subject out of the realm of political controversy and base it on the advice of the medical people involved <e> <s> i would like to feel that i could accept that approach but i find that there are a number of difficulties in relation to it some of which my noble friend lord ennals has already outlined <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment tabled by the noble earl lord russell for reasons already expressed by many noble lords <e> <s> as was said by the noble lord lord rippon while we appreciate the thoughtfulness of the minister <e>", "<cs> i find myself in the unusual position of being in complete agreement with the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> it seems to me that there are a number of considerations to be looked at here <e> <s> i do not think the amendment quite meets them all <e> <s> i am not opposed to the amendment but i regard it has a second best measure <e> <s> if it were to be carried it would mean that those students who suffer from having to pay for accommodation in high cost areas would to a certain extent have that payment alleviated <e> <s> nevertheless it would mean that they would find themselves with a larger loan at the end of their student days <e> <s> they would then have to <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister will clarify the wording in subsection a <e> <s> does it mean that any particular premises need not be inspected in one particular year <e> <s> the wording is any particular year <e> <s> would it be possible for instance for the authority to determine that the premises will not be inspected this year and then next year also to determine that they will not be inspected or will it be confined to one year only <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first ask the noble lord the minister and the noble baronesses lady seear and lady ewart-biggs to forgive me if i have to slip away before the end of the debate <e> <s> i hope to be able to stay to the end but i have to get away to catch a train <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support these two amendments <e> <s> i was rather disappointed at the intervention of the noble baroness lady elles who opposed the amendment <e> <s> in our discussion in committee there was nothing to indicate that the government would automatically monitor the scheme <e> <s> as i read the amendments they are not concerned with accounts and the auditing of accounts <e> <s> they refer to the participation of students in higher education <e> <s> we must therefore monitor the trends <e>", "<cs> my lords the first amendment is concerned with maintenance <e> <s> my noble friend made a strong point when she said that maintenance available to mature students for dependants would be affected by the amount of the student loan <e> <s> these two matters should be separated <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl can give an assurance that student loans will be discounted when assessments are made for maintenance <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been a general consensus in the country that the national health service is one of our great post-war achievements <e> <s> no one has said that it is perfect or cannot be improved <e> <s> nor has it been free of criticism <e> <s> all of us have had our grumbles about it from time to time and some of those have been justified <e> <s> however its facilities have been comprehensive and they have been accessible <e> <s> it has been a truly national health service <e> <s> therefore it is not surprising that when such major changes are proposed there should be considerable concern <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate is very timely <e> <s> as my noble friend lord underhill indicated some urgent decisions need to be taken in connection with the links to the channel tunnel <e> <s> but even if those decisions were taken immediately we should still be far behind the french who as the noble lord lord hankey has just said have undertaken a tremendous investment programme in their rail infrastructure <e> <s> these decisions need to be taken quickly <e>", "<cs> my lords the timing of the debate is opportune as the united nations population funds annual report entitled <e>", "<cs> i also wish to support the noble lord particularly his amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> earlier we discussed primary and secondary pollution <e> <s> moving his amendment the noble lord referred to the extraction of limestone gypsum and the effect that that has on the environment particularly in areas of outstanding beauty in some of our national parks <e> <s> he did not refer to the secondary effects which should also be in the environmental statement <e> <s> these areas are often somewhat remote from major roads <e> <s> enormous lorries carry the quarried limestone through the national parks creating hazards and dangers to people enjoying the parks and other environmental problems <e> <s> these should be taken fully into account in the assessment and included in the statement attached to the plan <e>", "<cs> rose to move that this house takes note of the report of the european communities committee on european schools and language learning in united kingdom schools <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that intervention <e> <s> i must inform the house that he was very diligent in pointing out to the committee from time to time that the system in scotland is quite different from that in england and wales <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been an interesting debate <e> <s> i am grateful to all noble lords for the many issues that they have raised some arising from the report and some from their wide experience <e> <s> there has been a great deal of unanimity on both sides of the house about the importance and urgency of the subject <e> <s> i am glad that that agreement has been accepted by the government <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for what she said in her response to the debate <e> <s> i ask that she looks carefully again at what has been said today especially in relation to the early introduction of teaching a modern foreign language in primary schools <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to support the commons amendments and to speak against the amendment in the name of the noble baroness lady cox and others <e> <s> i do so for two reasons <e> <s> first this house has considered the matter on a number of occasions and has come to very clear decisions on it <e> <s> secondly i happen to believe that the commons amendments provide the right circumstances for dealing with what can be very distressing situations situations which do not occur very frequently <e> <s> we have already heard from the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor and others that in the last year for which we have figures late abortions took place <e> <s> there is no evidence to conclude that by passing these amendments we shall increase that number <e>", "<cs> my lords in supporting my noble friends motion i should like to talk about the problems of access to further and higher education <e> <s> in a sense i shall be following some of the themes of the noble lord lord addington <e>"]
