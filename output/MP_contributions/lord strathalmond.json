["<cs> my lords i ask for your lordships indulgence in taking up a few minutes of your time with perhaps more nervousness than many other maiden speakers <e> <s> neither my father nor my grandfather before him had the opportunity to speak in this place <e> <s> this is the first time therefore that anyone from my family has attempted to contribute to a debate here <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first say that i am not often a visitor to your lordships house <e> <s> the last time i spoke here was in when there was a certain bill known as the lloyds bill coming before this house <e> <s> it was given an unequivocal vote of approval by your lordships house at that time and it is under that act that we now govern ourselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord <e> <s> i think though that we ought to revert to my mothers heritage on the other side of the atlantic where we refer to something as a double whammy <e> <s> that would describe an amendment which appears to be innocent to your lordships house but which could actually embrace another very large activity <e> <s> as i understand this amendment if it were approved and passed by your lordships house i would not be allowed to conduct any underwriting affairs for any of my names in any way whatsoever and it would not only include the investment activity to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> that is my understanding <e> <s> if i am wrong perhaps i may speak to the noble lord about it later <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will permit me to speak one more time he directed a number of remarks to me and perhaps i can respond to them <e> <s> i did not wish to go into as much detail as this <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the house will give me leave to respond to the noble lord <e> <s> i am sorry <e> <s> there are two different activities that an underwriting agent carries out <e> <s> i believe that this amendment as worded will embrace both of those activities <e> <s> one is the activity of trading with unlimited liability and the other as the noble lord quite rightly points out is the investment management of premiums and indeed of retained profits which are called reserves by either a syndicate managing agent or the underwriting agent who looks after the affairs of the members of lloyds <e>"]
