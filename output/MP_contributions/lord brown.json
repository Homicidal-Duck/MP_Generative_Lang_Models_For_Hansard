["<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate the noble viscount lord trenchard on his appointment as minister on the front bench <e> <s> i hope that he will have a very successful career there because industry is so important to our country <e> <s> however i must confess to some disappointment with his speech because very little is known in the country at large about the type of industrial strategy that the new government will follow <e> <s> perhaps it is understandable that we did not get much information from him today <e> <s> i am not being over critical as regards that but it draws attention to the fact that the government are proposing to rely on large reductions in income tax as a way of re-inspiring british management to rescue industry from the low ebb to which it has fallen <e> <s> i hope that they will succeed in that aim <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble viscount for one moment <e> <s> he is making rather heavy weather of this point <e> <s> i think the criticism which is being made is not the one that he hopes nobody in the house will make <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make a very short interjection <e> <s> i have constantly wanted to make the remarks i am going to make in relation to various measures proposed by the eec <e> <s> if one makes what i call blunderbuss legislation to apply to detailed matters in all member countries one is bound to produce something which at times is unsuitably clumsy for the effect it is trying to produce <e> <s> here is an example <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house are grateful to the noble lord lord mottistone for giving us the opportunity to debate the subject of industrial training <e> <s> in the presence of what one might call current government euphoria for levying cuts in expenditure without any apparent consideration of priorities we are indeed very alarmed that the axe may well fall on industrial training <e> <s> indeed the debate last week in this house on the indiscriminating treatment being handed out to the universities gives us justifiable cause for alarm <e> <s> this debate is therefore an opportunity of finding out what the immediate future holds for the industrial training boards and i am sure that we are very grateful to the noble lord lord mottistone for the information that he has given us about their operations and for his proposals for if i may put it this way amelioration of their situation <e> <s> i found myself largely in agreement with his remarks so far as they related to the industrial training boards <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to ask just one question <e> <s> is the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i assure the minister that they do not support postgraduate part-time msc students in universities <e> <s> the itbs have stated that it is not in their function to do so <e>", "<cs> the remarks of the noble lord lord wigoder about my noble and learned friend lord mccluskey were unfortunate but i do not rise to comment on that <e> <s> i merely wish to point out that this debate has been characterised by a high degree of exaggeration <e> <s> i should like to point out to the noble lord lord wigoder who stated that any witness forced to give his name and address would be a useless witness that many people looking at an event taking place an offence or prospective offence will not offer their names and will go away rather than risk the trouble of having to attend as a witness <e> <s> but having given their names and having been asked to attend as a witness they will behave like citizens <e> <s> it is a gross exaggeration to suggest that anyone whose name is forcibly taken would necessarily be an unreliable or reluctant witness <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the only realistic attack on this problem is to get down support prices for food under the common agricultural policy and thereby reduce the production of surpluses <e> <s> are not members on the opposite benches a little ashamed now of the continued caustic comments which they made on the efforts of mr silkin to this end while we were in government <e>"]
