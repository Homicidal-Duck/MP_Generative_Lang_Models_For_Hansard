about those people who have been obliged to take premature retirement from departments in our universities and have immediately been snapped up by universities overseas <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for that answer <e> <s> since the matter was last discussed in your lordships house royal insurance has renewed its generous sponsorship yet again without producing any corresponding response from the government <e> <s> is this because the government still believe their subsidy to be sufficient <e> <s> or could it be because the arts council refuses to accept an earmarked grant <e>", "<cs> my lords following upon what the noble baroness said the value of the rsc to tourism has been conservatively estimated at about million per year <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say how often officials at the oal meet their counterparts at the department of employment which is responsible for tourism in order to assess that income and to assist the rsc to

by telling me what specific budgets have been assigned by the welsh office for the welsh valleys initiative for the coming three years and whether the number of civil servants specifically assigned to the welsh valleys initiative is planned to rise or fall <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that two years into the welsh valleys initiative the level of unemployment in merthyr and rhymney which are at the centre of the valleys is still the highest in wales <e> <s> in the light of that fact will he congratulate the former secretary of state for wales on having in the welsh valleys initiative written the finest work of fiction since the <e>", "<cs> i rise to support my noble friend lord prys-davies in his proposal which i do not consider to be racist or nationalist in any offensive sense <e> <s> it is a modest little proposal intended simply to require the commission to remember the special or national needs of northern ireland scotland and wales because these are not regions in the english sense <e> <s> two of them are nations and northern ireland is surely a uniquely sensitive area <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment proposed by my noble friend lady white <e> <s> it represents a helpful improvement to the wording of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i say that for three reasons <e> <s> first without in any way wishing to let loose the rottweilers of critical analysis on the drafting of the amendment as has been pointed out there is a certain edwardian elitism about such phrases as <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that during the recess

parts of that extraordinarily beautiful area <e> <s> is he further aware that i would willingly walk it again if he would agree to accompany me to point out to him a dozen sites in that area which from an environmental point of view would be infinitely better as a site for his equipment <e>", "<cs> my lords in a gracious speech made long ago it was wisely said that man does not live by bread alone <e> <s> i was reminded of that yesterday as i listened with great care to the the governments proposals for legislation during the coming session <e> <s> amid plentiful plans for dealing with crime transport and the weapons of war not one word was said about the arts sciences research the theatre orchestras art galleries museums or britains national heritage in any shape or form <e> <s> yet legislation is desperately needed in those areas <e> <s> that great growth industry requires and demands vision and guidance from government if it is to contribute properly to national prosperity
