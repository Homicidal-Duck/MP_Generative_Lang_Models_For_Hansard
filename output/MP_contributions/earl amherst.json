["<cs> my lords i too thank the noble lord for repeating that statement which is a considerable relief in so far as the dcs in this country are concerned but do the government feel that the long delays which have occurred and are still occurring on the other side of the atlantic have been justified <e> <s> have they any views on how british airlines notably laker airways caledonian airways and british airways can seek compensation for the immense amount of money they have lost and are continuing to lose on account of these delays <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the technical knowledge to enable me to follow fully the noble earl lord kimberley in his detailed description of various aircraft and jet engines and their particular relativity to the fuel consumption and noise aspects save to point out that i am told by what i believe to be fully reliable sources that aerospace is very much alive to these problems and that they are confident that the know-how of their specialist staffs is more than competent to tackle these problems and tackle them successfully <e> <s> further i am informed that the rolls-royce rb is not only suitable to power the airbus a but also its successor the mark ii airbus the a <e> <s> it also has yet another rolls-royce engine the rb which should be available in the late s and which will be particularly suitable to power the medium/short-haul aircraft both in europe and in the united states <e> <s> also it has a smaller engine the rb particularly suitable to power the smaller executive jet aircraft for which i am told there is a considerable market <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter for giving us the opportunity to discuss once again this vexed question of the delay in passengers baggage arriving at heathrow airport a problem which simply does not seem to go away <e> <s> but before discussing whether another inquiry is likely to produce a solution i should like to draw attention once more to the causes of the problem and to note the steps which arc at present being taken to try to alleviate it <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we also thank the noble lord for repeating this interesting statement <e> <s> i would also echo the remarks of the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i too from these benches would like to thank the noble lord lord trefgarne for initiating this debate which enables us to find out what changes have taken place in airports policy since the present government came into office and to note what progress has been made <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the minister for taking us through this bill which details the machinery for denationalisation of british aerospace and for turning it into a commercial company <e> <s> however i do not think that the bill explains and with due respect nor do i think the noble lord fully explained just why at this juncture this is necessary when according to my information british aerospace a vital and go-ahead organisation has done and is doing very well <e> <s> i should like to support what the noble lord has already said about the noble lord lord beswick whose performance has been superb <e> <s> is it thought that by taking this action sales of the new company will be increased its considerable international reputation enhanced and its relations with its foreign partners and business contacts strengthened <e> <s> if so how is that to be done <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord lord cullen of ashbourne will be able to amplify that <e>", "<cs> i am not happy with the explanation that has been given by the noble lord or the fact that he thinks that this company should be treated the same as an ordinary commercial company <e> <s> it is not the same it is a special company <e> <s> in that case i must ask the opinion of the committee <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment very strongly <e> <s> i agree with everything that the noble lord lord ponsonby has said <e> <s> my special reference is to security <e> <s> assuming the control of the board is by a simple majority per cent <e> <s> is a protection against any possibility of foreign infiltration <e> <s> if it is not a simple majority then we will have to be told what it is <e> <s> if it is a simple majority then if we get per cent <e> <s> of the voting rights we can control the position so that the company is not infiltrated by foreign interests <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the minister for repeating this statement which we on these benches are not too happy about in that it seems to challenge the whole basis of validity value and protection of the caa licence <e> <s> only three months ago or thereabouts the caa who were set up to issue such licences which were formerly issued by the board of trade issued a licence for caledonian airways to operate this route <e> <s> at that time presumably it took into full consideration all the arguments that were used by cathay pacific laker and anybody else interested balanced the thing up and made the decision to issue the licence <e> <s> now an airline having got a licence assumes considerable financial liability in order to find staff and equipment to operate that licence <e> <s> if a short three months after that licence is issued the minister apparently on his own account decides not to cancel that licence but so to modify it as to let in other operators which renders practically valueless the paper on which the licence is written have british caledonian airways any recompense for the money they have expended on aircraft and additional staff <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to be the first to thank the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter for providing this opportunity for us to discuss the vexed question of air fares in europe <e> <s> i should also like to offer my congratulations to him and his committee for turning out this excellent long detailed and very interesting report <e> <s> i think all concerned must have been involved ill a great deal of hard work in getting it out <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the whole house will be indebted and grateful to the noble lord for his detailed and clear exposition of this bill <e> <s> i should like to start by saying that we on these benches welcome the proposals to provide participation of the workforce of british airways in the new shareholding and to give them certain preferential treatment in the buying of shares and i <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for making this statement <e> <s> as has been said this news comes as no surprise to us but we have a feeling that the government knew about it a long time ago and we regret very much that they did not make this information available until today <e> <s> doubtless we shall have time and opportunity to go into it more deeply during the committee stage on thursday <e>", "<cs> we on these benches would like to support very strongly what the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede has said <e> <s> we said at second reading that we did not think that this was an appropriate moment to denationalise british airways <e> <s> as the noble lord lord trefgarne has said british airways are in the middle of re-fleeting themselves and reorganising their <e>", "<cs> in support of the amendment i want to raise the issue that i raised on second reading that is that a per cent <e> <s> holding protects a company against infiltration of undesirables or perhaps foreign interests <e> <s> the noble lord lord trefgarne was good enough to write to me on that issue and point out that this situation could be protected by conditions of the articles of association <e> <s> but we all know that articles of association can be amended by a decision of the board at any time so there is no permanent protection there <e> <s> the noble lord also told me that the government have the right in the event of any such thing happening to purchase a sufficient number of shares to give it a per cent <e> <s> holding to protect it <e>", "<cs> even so i go on to the fact about the long-stop <e> <s> the noble lord lord trefgarne pointed out that the government can take up the shares but what happens if the time comes which i hope it never will that they want to take up these shares and these shares are owned by those who do not want to sell <e> <s> do the government then order them to be sold or make a new issue or what <e> <s> what is the position then <e>", "<cs> as has been said before we on these benches always have been interested in the promotion of schemes whereby employees participate in the companies for which they work <e> <s> this bill gives a very good opportunity for that to happen <e> <s> this particular amendment goes a little further in that it gives the opportunity for the voices of those shareholders to be heard at board level <e> <s> the ordinary shareholders can express their opinions through the directors <e> <s> why should not this special lot of shareholders have the opportunity to make their voices heard on the board through the way that this amendment suggests <e> <s> consequently i hope that the government will agree to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> is there not some confusion which has arisen <e> <s> i was talking about not the issue of a licence but the position when once a licence has been issued it is then subsequently cancelled or modified <e> <s> is there no way an operator can then make an appeal on this cancellation or modification <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene before the noble minister replies to say that we support this amendment in that it particularly applies to charges for security and search <e> <s> the airlines are billed with these charges and in turn <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us if the selling of these tickets in any way impinges on the governments approval of the international fares structures agreed between the designated operators under the bermuda formula <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord glenarthur for giving us the opportunity to discuss this matter and i strongly support him in his request to the government for an assurance that they will continue their support of the concorde services for the following reasons which i should like to give quite briefly <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord glenkinglas for raising this motion but he has raised it in such wide terms that in the interests of brevity i think i shall confine myself to drawing attention to some of the more salient points <e> <s> british airways is the first special mention on the motion and like most airlines in the west this airline is now suffering from a monumental slump in traffic <e> <s> this condition is not helped by the current rises in fuel and airport charges but as the noble lord lord trefgarne has said that this matter is <e>", "<cs> my lords as your lordships know the noble lord lord trefgarne has on more than one <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that the high tariffs charged by the caa to the airlines are largely responsible for the very high fares now charged by the operators <e>", "<cs> my lords i also should like to thank the minister for taking us through this short amendment bill <e> <s> although short it does have implications and does raise some questions <e> <s> we welcome the consolidation aspects as they should clear away some of the anomalies and confusion which have long plagued the industry <e> <s> we also welcome the provision of increased borrowing powers of british airways which we understand should take care of that corporations needs in that aspect for the next five years <e> <s> i understand that all but some per cent <e> <s> of these funds will be allotted to the provision of new more fuel-efficient and less noisy aircraft and the balance of per cent <e> <s> will be used mainly to re-equip such technical equipment as engineering computers and the improvement of sales offices <e> <s> this relief comes usefully at a very critical time when the corporation is coming close to the successful culmination of an extremely difficult and delicate operation to reduce and reconstruct the corporation to what mr roy watts the chief executive has described as a leaner more efficient and more competitive airline <e> <s> can the minister assure us that once this bill is passed there will be no delay in the corporation being able to start to reap the benefits of this so as to proceed at once with their forward planning <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government agree that the sudden collapse of laker airways now raises most important questions regarding consumer interest taxpayers money and route licensing let alone the livelihood of the large laker airways staff and many other issues that now arise in what is now a vast international business will the government issue now or urgently a statement of what is to be their future policy for civil aviation <e>", "<cs> my lords we wish to thank the noble lord for explaining so clearly the matters under consideration <e> <s> we are also very glad to hear of something going down not up even though it is on only a temporary basis <e> <s> as i think your lordships already know the levy is based on the number of incoming passengers <e> <s> as your lordships also know incoming passengers are not concerned with security <e> <s> as we all know it is the outgoing passengers who together with their hand luggage are searched <e> <s> i am told that this method is adopted because it suits the administrative convenience of the british airports authority <e> <s> i am also told that to date the total of incoming passengers and the total of outgoing passengers more or less tally <e> <s> therefore so far as the passenger is concerned and in the last analysis it is the passenger who pays it does not seem very much to matter which method is adopted <e> <s> however i should like to ask the minister whether if in the course of time the figures vary and there is a considerable or an appreciable difference between the number of outgoing passengers and the number of incoming passengers the matter will he reassessed and possibly the method changed <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the noble lord lord beswick in his unstarred question <e> <s> he has explained it in such great detail that he has left hardly anything for me to say <e> <s> there surely can be no question that joining their european partners the french and the germans in the production of the a airbus would provide eurospace with the unique opportunity of participating in the field of advanced technology involved in the production of this particular civil aircraft <e> <s> so i shall not take up your lordships time in repeating what we have already been told save to emphasise that the a is undoubtedly an important advance in the medium/short range passenger capacity particularly in fuel economy and noise reduction <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us if after privatisation british airways is to be known as the national flag carrier <e> <s> further if there is to be a reallocation of routes do the government contemplate a renegotiation of the governmental bilateral air agreements <e>", "<cs> my lords i too offer my congratulations to the noble lord lord chapple on his maiden speech <e> <s> i rise briefly to support entirely what was said so well by the noble baroness lady burton of coventry <e> <s> i wish to make special reference to what she said about the second runway at gatwick <e> <s> gatwick has now developed into a fine and efficient airport <e> <s> it has a remarkable rail connection with the centre of london <e> <s> there is a non-stop train leaving victoria four times an hour for gatwick and vice versa <e> <s> this service caters for all traffic including baggage <e> <s> it is a good deal ahead of what is now offered through the extension of the piccadilly tube line to heathrow <e> <s> that service has a good frequency and a journey time of about minutes from piccadilly circus <e> <s> however it can cater only for those passengers with no or very light baggage <e>"]
