["<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the minister for taking us through this bill which details the machinery for denationalisation of british aerospace and for turning it into a commercial company <e> <s> however i do not think that the bill explains and with due respect nor do i think the noble lord fully explained just why at this juncture this is necessary when according to my information british aerospace a vital and go-ahead organisation has done and is doing very well <e> <s> i should like to support what the noble lord has already said about the noble lord lord beswick whose performance has been superb <e> <s> is it thought that by taking this action sales of the new company will be increased its considerable international reputation enhanced and its relations with its foreign partners and business contacts strengthened <e> <s> if so how is that to be done <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord lord cullen of ashbourne will be able to amplify that <e>"]
