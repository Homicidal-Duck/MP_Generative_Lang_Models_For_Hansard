["<cs> my lords the purpose of our debate is to call attention to the vital importance of the service sectors of british industry to the health of the economy <e> <s> we have heard some criticism today <e> <s> i shall begin my speech by repeating what a senator of the upper house in the united states once said <e> <s> he made the mistake of describing himself as a self-made man <e> <s> he paid for that mistake when the following speaker told the senate that he had also shown that he worshipped his creator <e> <s> i shall not run that risk this afternoon <e> <s> however i shall have something to say about my own experience in british industry and about the changes and chances that not only brought me to your lordships house but also gave me the lifelong satisfaction of participating in this nations industry and in developing an industrial enterprise that has made and is still making a small but positive contribution to the national economy and to its international balance of payments <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister be so kind as to let me know whether this is an auspicious opening for the house of lords or have you your priorities right <e>", "<cs> i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord dunleath upon bringing forward this question <e> <s> i have listened most attentively to the debate this evening and i have made a few notes <e> <s> the noble earl lord longford raised quite a number of points which i considered most relevant <e> <s> the noble duke mentioned many matters regarding religion and he even mentioned planters <e> <s> planters were the people who were sent to northern ireland in years gone by and their descendants are speaking here tonight <e> <s> i have nothing against them <e> <s> i feel that now they are irishmen <e> <s> a planter is as good an irishman as i am and i am a planter in reverse <e> <s> i came to this country a poor man and i was treated excellently <e> <s> this emotive business of ireland is frightening <e>", "<cs> my lords let me assure the noble duke that in no sense was i being derogatory <e> <s> i do not know where the heck he got that from <e> <s> i approach this matter quite sanely quite realistically <e> <s> to me planters are nonexistent today as similarly i would trust that i am not looked upon as someone who merely arrived here <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord kindly be prepared to take some advice on the difference between tax evasion and tax avoidance by going to the right reverend prelates on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords before i enter into the debate looking around this chamber my heart goes out to those who are here tonight who have suffered from the terrorists of ireland and i wish it to be known that no good irishman would ever wish to be associated with the things that have happened <e>", "<cs> my lords what i am suggesting is that if britain and the republic of ireland came together i would go over myself and sort that out in about ten minutes <e> <s> they are nothing they do not count <e> <s> they are just a small group of bandits <e> <s> they have no say in the matter <e> <s> but while you make suggestions like those you have made you are making enemies of the peace-loving people of ireland and the peace-loving people of ireland are not going to be friendly towards you while you make those statements <e> <s> those people those bandits those ira those communists call them what you like are so infinitesimal in the overall population picture that if britain and southern ireland would get together and talk these people would disappear like the mist on the mountain they would be gone tomorrow <e>", "<cs> i will go when you cease to talk about laying landmines in ireland <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry i apologise to the noble lord lord elton <e> <s> you have always been a keen critic of me and you are continuing to be so <e> <s> i do not object to that <e> <s> i am not going to belabour your lordships much longer with my talk <e> <s> i just want it to be known here that ireland the republic of ireland the people of northern ireland want peace but for gods sake let them talk <e> <s> as a matter of fact i wish you would go away and let us talk together and i honestly believe that peace would come about much quicker than pumping in million to keep a wrecked ship afloat <e>", "<cs> my lords they would not be there for five minutes <e> <s> in fact i had sat down but i shall answer by saying that they would not last five minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister not agree that if we could get an amalgamation of the approach to animal welfare north and south it might have a bearing on easing the burden of cruelty that exists in the north and does not exist in the south to the same extent <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble and learned lord agree that in view of the talks that are to take place between mr haughey and the prime minister we should leave matters of this nature in abeyance for the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be extremely brief in approaching this order which i realise is a necessity <e> <s> having listened to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran i should like to make just one or two points <e> <s> the noble lord the minister has stated that while the sums of money available for defence are large they are very heavily committed <e> <s> my noble friend lord brooks of tremorfa has brought up the matter of northern ireland and the disciplines that prevail among the forces in northern ireland <e> <s> i do not for a moment think that he was implying that discipline should be in any way lowered if through emotional stress some members of our forces commit offences that would be punished very severely here in britain <e> <s> i will await the ministers views on that <e>", "<cs> my lords while i also wish to congratulate the minister and her majestys government on their attempt to bring about some form of compromise in northern ireland i should like to state that it is utterly futile to hope for any form of success without consultations with the government of southern ireland <e> <s> to me that is absolutely imperative to bring about any form of peaceful <e>", "<cs> would the minister not agree that bearing this in mind there is as much chance of a settlement in northern ireland as there is of belfast becoming the vatican city <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble duke refers to the province of ulster <e> <s> three of the ulster counties politically are under the control of the republic of ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord hunt of tanworth for his maiden speech which i considered to be an excellent one regardless of the fact that some of the views he professed do not agree with mine but that is secondary in the overall picture <e> <s> i also wish to thank the noble lord lord elton for having given us the opportunity to discuss the paper today <e> <s> people have said that friday is not a suitable day to get it in properly but i say that any day when we can discuss northern ireland with a view to bringing about a settlement of the predicament is a good day <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm the rumour which prevails that the little people in the republic of ireland have put a curse on the weather in great britain and will lift it when their weather gets bbc <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord somers has been unable to remain in the house owing to being unwell but he has asked me to convey his apologies to your lordships and on his behalf i beg to move that the report be now received <e>", "<cs> my lords may i congratulate the minister on his wonderful success in this matter <e> <s> might it be possible on this day when the irish pay homage to their patron saint for the noble lord to take over the cudgels in that direction with equal success <e>"]
