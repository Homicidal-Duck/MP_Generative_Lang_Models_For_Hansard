["<cs> my lords my first and most agreeable task of course is to congratulate most warmly the noble lord lord carrington on his appointment and to wish him well in his most difficult task <e> <s> he certainly brings to his great office qualities of the highest order in particular wide experience and balanced judgment <e> <s> he will be confronted by problems of an unimaginable complexity where judgment as to the balance of consequences is vital to their solution <e> <s> there are certainly so far as i can see no foreign or security questions which are susceptible of simplistic solutions by extremism <e> <s> we on these benches will not indulge in fractious criticism because we believe that there is a very large expanse of common ground in foreign and commonwealth questions and in relation to defence and security <e> <s> that is not a matter of reproach but of reassurance that a country should find the largest possible amount of common ground among the parties on those two fundamental matters <e> <s> indeed it is when that common ground is seriously eroded or even tends to disappear as in the s and during the suez adventure that this country and democracy itself is in its greatest peril <e> <s> so we shall do our best not only to maintain the common ground and that continuity of which the noble lord spoke but if possible to expand that ground <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is accustomed to giving way as i have been accustomed to giving way to her and i am most grateful to her now <e> <s> why go after <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to convey to his colleagues who deal directly with this matter the suggestion from this side of the house that they should not be too <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene briefly simply to lend whatever support i can to perhaps three points which have already been made with great cogency in this short but very useful debate and to put one question to the minister <e> <s> i would not myself derogate from the right of the noble lord lord banks or the liberal party to raise this matter but i join my noble friend lord greenwood of rossendale in suggesting that we might well wait until the new parliament is duly elected before we begin to speculate as to possible increases to its powers or indeed to its power <e> <s> in that i join with him very strongly and also in what he said about the definition of the functions of the european assembly as it was then called <e> <s> he defined them in the actual terms of article which is that the assembly was conceived as a body exercising a supervisory and an advisory function <e>", "<cs> my lords may i inform the minister drawing on my own experience that i agree on the efficacy of diplomatic bilateral approaches in these matters <e> <s> at the same time as my noble friend has pointed out it is necessary to keep this issue very much alive in the public mind here and in other countries <e> <s> may i have his assurance i am sure he will give it me that between now and the next review conference which will be held in madrid next year the foreign and commonwealth office will as we did in my time seek to have bilateral discussions with as many countries as possible who will be involved in that review conference particularly on the question of human rights so that we all arrive in madrid with a better prospect of practical results on human rights than we did in belgrade <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first of all congratulate the noble lord on the way in which he has moved the second reading of this bill <e> <s> as i said when i performed a similar duty on that side of the house a few weeks ago this is a good bill <e> <s> no independence bill is without difficulty as many members of this house are well aware <e> <s> i have handled more than my fair share of them <e> <s> i can assure the house that every one of them presents almost implacable differences of view of opinion of interest and this is no exception <e> <s> the heart and centre of the difficulty here was of course the varying attitudes of the banabans and of the rest of the gilbertese as to the future of ocean island one of the islands which will constitute the new state <e>", "<cs> my lords while i should like to support my noble friend in his understandable concern that rents in hong kong or anywhere else for that matter should not increase unduly i am sure that he would agree with the secretary of state that the rate of future progress in new building of very necessary homes in hong kong is related to the rent policy <e> <s> over-subsidisation of existing houses and indeed houses now being built may have an adverse effect on the rate of future building <e> <s> i am sure that i am speaking for my noble friend when i say that surely the essential aim of the hong kong government is to expand public building as fast and as economically as possible <e> <s> at the same time it would be very helpful indeed if the vietnamese government were to exercise somewhat more humane policies before they send thousands of refugees from their country to swell the number of homeless in hong kong <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure it is within the knowledge and recollection of the secretary of state when i say that successive governments have no actual power to prohibit these visits but they do exercise their best endeavours in the interests of anti-racism to persuade these clubs not to engage in these fixtures <e>", "<cs> the cumulation of certain references to my minor role in these important matters before the general election interrupted me leads me to rise <e> <s> of course we stand for the expansion of social democracy for the gilbertese people as a whole as much as for the banabans <e>", "<cs> before the minister proceeds with this most welcome piece of information which i <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble viscount for introducing this useful debate and for the manner in which he did so <e> <s> we are also extremely appreciative of the work of the sub-committee one of the most important sub-committees of the select committee on european policy the sub-committee on trade and treaties for the work they have put in on this extremely important matter <e> <s> incidentally we were glad to have from him a report on the improving health of the chairman of the sub-committee my noble friend lord trevelyan and i am sure the house will wish the noble viscount to convey to lord trevelyan our general wish that his recovery will be a speedy and full one <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord leaves the question of the possibility of countervailing action may i put a point to him <e> <s> i understand that the monitoring exercise which has been agreed although it has been restricted to two routes and there are a number of other reservations about it in some quarters will take two years <e> <s> the present eec attitude if i may call it that is that countervailing measures should not be considered or thought out until the monitoring exercise if and when it takes place has been completed <e> <s> that puts the point of countervailing action if it proves necessary at at least two years and very probably at least three years beyond today <e> <s> in the meantime the pressures on our own shipping and that of others among our partners are real and may intensify <e> <s> may i ask the minister to give urgent consideration to pressing our friends and partners to engage in a notional exercise on countermeasures pending the end of the monitoring period <e> <s> what is to be lost by doing that while the monitoring is going on rather than postponing even the consideration of the measures until after the monitoring is over which would be two years ahead <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure we may take it from the minister may we not <e> <s> that it is the intention of the present government to ensure that a minister from the foreign and commonwealth office will from time to time be attending the plenary sessions of the reconstituted committee on disarmament in geneva <e> <s> may i in asking that exhortatory question add the query is the minister in a position to say whether a minister at his office has been designated as minister for disarmament <e>", "<cs> my lords i made two points <e> <s> the first was that a minister would attend some of the plenary sessions of the reconstituted committee on disarmament in geneva <e> <s> the second was a distinct question will a minister be designated as minister for disarmament <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he can give an assurance that in addition to paying due regard to his partys and his governments social policy which involves swingeing cuts in public expenditure from which we understand overseas aid is not to be exempted they will also have regard to their international commitment with other countries to try to achieve the internationally accepted targets of expenditure on aid which the united nations has approved <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that we on this side welcome the tone of the foreign secretarys answers this afternoon and certainly would support him in his hope <e> <s> we wish him well in all the discussions he will hold <e> <s> perhaps he would like to assure the house that in future discussions he will take full advantage of the very promising initiative of the five which although it met with certain difficulties after a very good beginning nevertheless holds a great deal of hope for a solution in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that i shall echo the feelings of everybody in the house this afternoon when i say how grateful we are to the noble lord the leader of the house for so clearly presenting this statement to us <e> <s> it is not a tremendous breakthrough in any sense of the word <e> <s> it makes no reference to what happened about the cap on the margin of this meeting but i will not go into that at the moment <e> <s> it is a statement in which the sentiments are generally impeccable even though its proposals are somewhat imprecise <e> <s> may i put one or two points to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is surely aware that the previous administration addressed itself to two aspects of the british-spanish relationship <e> <s> the first and most important was the emergence into democracy after years of fascism of an <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to accept from this side of the house perhaps i might put this in an interrogatory form the full support of the opposition for the earliest possible resumption of normal diplomatic relations with a country with which we have had for some centuries ties of close friendship both commercial and cultural <e> <s> perhaps from this house might go to our argentinian friends as proof <e>", "<cs> my lords i strongly support my noble friend lord shinwell in the main point he made in regard to the forthcoming geneva conference <e> <s> we had a similar conference about two months ago the minister will recall when my honourable friend mr luard represented this country <e> <s> we thought we were getting somewhere at that conference but in fact it proved abortive <e> <s> i wish from this bench to support what lord shinwell said about the need to impress on the secretary-general who i take it will be convening this conference to have present all the relevant countries including the perpetrators and originators of this infamy <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no desire to press the minister for the wrong reasons but there is a point here <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that while he is right that the conference should be held first before recourse to the security council is practically considered that course should not be ruled out <e> <s> nevertheless it is plainly useless to go to geneva to discuss theoretically what should be done and what might be done when the people responsible not only for originating this infamy but for continuing it are not there <e> <s> i should like to ask the minister to be a little firmer and more forthright in his indications to the secretary-general that this country not only asks but insists that the other countries mentioned be present at the conference <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether the detailed statement which we have this afternoon been promised by the minister will be qualitative as well as quantitative <e> <s> it may be that the word majority has <e>", "<cs> my lords may i support what has been said generally and join the minister in emphasising that any further inquiry into this should make absolutely clear the difference between authentication of signature and condonation of content <e> <s> i think that the minister said quite a lot in support of that view <e> <s> perhaps a considered statement as a result of the continuing inquiry which as i understand it is going on would be welcome to this house and to those who have shown an interest in this matter this afternoon including myself <e>", "<cs> my lords while we on this side of the house would wish to ask the foreign secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords the phrase may i suggest is an interrogatory introduction to what i was going to say <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that we on this side would welcome an early and comprehensive statement by him on this matter arising from his first-hand examination and experience of this problem in hong kong <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord for so clearly explaining the purpose of this order the latest in a series of similar orders in which an outmoded system of association has been replaced by a more modern and effective system <e> <s> as the noble lord said we are conferring independence on saint vincent wholly at their request and in the way in which they want it to be conferred upon them namely under section of the act <e> <s> this is what they have asked for and this is what we are doing <e> <s> their democratically-elected government has acted throughout on behalf of the people of saint vincent and we have responded to that democratic will <e> <s> before matters developed to their present position the relationship between saint vincent and indeed other islands and this country was hardly colonial was it <e> <s> it was described by the chief minister of saint vincent as one of amicable dependence and it was in that spirit that the necessary movement towards a more modern arrangement with the united kingdom proceeded <e>", "<cs> my lords may i offer support for the general point made by the noble lord lord chelwood regarding this matter <e> <s> the six-monthly reports based on reports coming in from the field are indeed invaluable and the suggestion which may well be implemented at least in another place and i would hope in this house for a select committee is equally valuable <e> <s> my question is this over and above those provisions is there not room for repeating what the labour party did in government and i had a good deal to do with this namely setting up a specialised monitoring committee as we did under the very able chairmanship of my noble friend lord thomson <e> <s> their <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the foreign secretary bear in mind that we the opposition join with her majestys government in expressing abhorrence of practices such as these in that country or in any other country but equally with her majestys government we hope that ghana will find its way back to democratic practices and certainly will be represented in lusaka <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall detain your lordships for only a very few minutes because the minister has most carefully and precisely defined the purport of these three orders two of which are of course quite closely related <e> <s> as to the first dealing with intelsat this is an order conferring privileges and immunities on this organisation and certain of its representatives and as the minister explained it is in accordance with the agreement and protocol signed by the united kingdom in i think august <e> <s> as such the order flows from that agreement and that protocol and it is therefore common form in that sense and indeed in content and purport <e> <s> it does not at least significantly derogate from similar orders related to similar requirements <e> <s> we note with satisfaction <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the house will wish to thank the noble lord the foreign and commonwealth secretary for the statement he has just made <e> <s> for our part we entirely agree with the purpose and content of that statement it is very much in line with what we believe with the government to be the important facets of this appalling human tragedy which is unfortunately continuing in south-east asia <e> <s> we welcome very much the noble lords decision to be present as the british foreign secretary at the opening session in geneva <e> <s> when he has given the prestige <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister on second thoughts not agree that the question of my noble friend lord brockway relating to the committee on disarmament in geneva has everything to do with defence and security to the extent that in so far as we can get agreed mutually verifiable reductions in ground forces in central europe real security will follow disarmament and true security is the best form of defence we can get <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be extremely grateful to the noble viscount for the clarity with which he has moved this important order <e> <s> on the principle that one good speech is quite enough even for this house and even on such a fascinating subject as this i shall confine myself to just one or two points <e> <s> the opposition of course approves the order and joins with the government in hoping that the house will pass it <e> <s> we shall look forward to studying the noble viscounts speech in <e>", "<cs> my lords this is of course not a moment of controversy but of concern and <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government intending to make a full statement on the outcome of the geneva talks to either or both houses of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he is aware that we on this side of the house join wholeheartedly with my noble <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is grateful i am sure to the noble lord lord selsdon for initiating this short debate which should give her majestys government an opportunity to reiterate their views on the future of gibraltar and its people <e> <s> i think the noble lord made a powerful and cogent case for examining with great care the future of gibraltar as an economic entity within the eec in view of its special link economically and constitutionally with this country and certain difficulties that may arise if the mainland that is to say spain accedes to the community in with certain relationships between it and gibraltar still unresolved <e> <s> i think it is a speech that will bear careful scrutiny in the cold light of <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the policy of strictly scrutinising exports with a view to avoiding the export of strategic goods and services so called is being observed very stringently by a number of western powers and not least by this country <e> <s> can we take it that the present government are as stringent about this as were their predecessors and that this scrutiny includes not only the so-called comecon countries but similar countries in other parts of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether the noble lord is aware that that part of his answer referring to his government not applying strictly the same criteria as their predecessors is a somewhat cryptic statement <e> <s> can i take it that the variation to the criteria applied is not a variation of the strategic considerations borne in mind by the government as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble earl lord grey will allow me to intervene in the form of putting one or two questions for confirmation to the minister <e> <s> may i say at the outset that her majestys opposition entirely agree with the state <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may intervene again on what is again a matter of the satisfying of the rights and aspirations of minorities within a single state i hope that this debate will not in any way convey to the cypriots of whatever ethnic and linguistic nature any indication that we regard this difficult problem from the point of view of being either pro-turk or pro-greek <e> <s> we are all pro-cypriot <e> <s> indeed as my noble friend lord brockway who has this remarkable experience of international affairs reminded us a relatively short time ago there was not this strained dichotomy in this beautiful island with a population amounting to hardly more than <e> <s> they live together and enjoy life together the per cent <e> <s> who are greek the per cent <e> <s> or so who are turkish and the other per cent <e> <s> who are armenian british and of other nationalities <e>", "<cs> but my lords surely the minister must agree that adequate representation in conakry or anywhere else must have a very marked effect on our commercial and other prospects in that country and that it is an axiom of trade and diplomacy that there is no influence without contact <e> <s> is he further aware that my noble friend lord hatch has put the question very fairly indeed <e> <s> he was repeating a question that he put two or three weeks ago and indicating to the government that he hopes that they will consider this matter further during the prolonged recess which lies ahead <e> <s> i join with him in hoping that at the end of the recess there will be the announcement of an adequate level of representation in guinea <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put two points to the minister <e> <s> first does he agree that while it is essential that the united states and the soviet union should be in fundamental agreement on all practical forms of disarmament including the banning of chemical weapons which has been raised this afternoon nevertheless it is also essential for the enlarged committee in geneva to have a say in these matters <e> <s> in the past there has been a suspicion that disarmament talks have been confined to the negotiations of the two super powers without the rest of the world being properly consulted <e> <s> i hope the minister will confirm that her majestys government will take that view in regard to the work of the geneva committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all noble lords would wish to thank the noble lord for making this statement <e> <s> indeed we would all wish to congratulate him on the <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us what action he expects mr gundelach to take to ensure that the french government comply with the clear order of the european court <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord carrington for making that statement <e> <s> clearly the zimbabwe-rhodesia issue has reached a crucial and perhaps a decisive stage and as throughout the past nine weeks the opposition we on this side of the house do not propose to say or do anything today which may in the least imperil the chances of an agreed settlement <e> <s> the noble lord will need all his very considerable skills to complete a settlement which will be agree-able to all parties <e>", "<cs> my lords would the government confirm and agree that recent indications in certain arab quarters of a desire to help to induce a more rational attitude in iran towards the west gives some hope that the government in concert with others possibly in the european community might now approach the arab community with a request that they should revise their policy of boycott against israel <e>", "<cs> my lords does that mean that the united kingdom representation in europe would not raise it themselves but wait for somebody else to raise it <e> <s> surely this is a very worthwhile initiative that our own government should take in brussels <e>", "<cs> my lords there is very wide agreement in the country and in parliament as to what we all want to see in zimbabwe-rhodesia <e> <s> we want to see a settlement which stops the fighting adopts an agreed constitution establishes genuine majority rule through free elections leading to a lawful government deriving its authority from those elections <e> <s> it is agreed that there must be a transition period during which the neces <e>", "<cs> the first democratic election which is so regarded by the people most concerned the vast majority of the black africans of rhodesia <e>", "<cs> secondly we are still not clear about the timing of the arrival of the governor and his role when he gets there <e> <s> these are serious points <e> <s> they touch the point of legality and they also touch very closely indeed the point of efficacy once the governor is there <e> <s> he will go to zimbabwe as a plenipotentiary vested with all executive power including the military power <e> <s> if he goes out with those powers backed by effective agreement from lancaster house then his task although one of monumental difficulty will nevertheless be possible <e> <s> but if he goes out and i repeat my noble friends question as to the intentions of the government without the backing of such an agreement but merely on the basis of a bilateral arrangement or contrivance with the salisbury parties then his task will not only prove to be impossible but it may lead to new dimensions of disaster involving this country in an actual confrontation with the patriotic front and the front-line presidents with the oau and with significant countries in that continent such as nigeria <e> <s> he will take over from the salisbury rgime not only the civil administration but the military and police power <e> <s> through him as the only legal government in the country the united kingdom will be governing rhodesia and it will be responsible for law and order and for any threat to it both from inside and from outside the country <e>", "<cs> i find it very difficult indeed to respond to what the secretary of state has said <e> <s> it is equally intolerable indeed unthinkable that we should move to secure these powers while a war is going on <e> <s> it is to say the least pointless to proceed in that way and could be dangerous <e> <s> i fear that i cannot withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> i can hardly press this amendment after that extremely helpful speech by the mimister <e> <s> i think enough has been said and no more will be said to emphasise that we regard the democratic electoral process as very much an integral part of the transition period and of the period following that transition <e> <s> in view of what the noble lord has said i will not press the amendment and i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the government have no unusually evil intentions <e> <s> i am sure too that the noble lord would not only wish the constitution to be applied in the most effective way possible but would need to be able to apply certain parts before others <e> <s> he would also need to be able to vary not only nomenclature in the case of the governor and the president but also perhaps electoral processes the substitution of the list system for one election in preference to the constituency system <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble lord for having explained the governments intentions in this matter and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister of state quoted the subsidy provided to british housewives on a pound of butter <e> <s> is not that rather less than is provided in subsidy for butter sold to the russians <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the minister for repeating in this house the statement made in another place <e> <s> will he agree that the implementation of the political agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords how recently <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just add one suggestion in the best possible spirit arising from what we heard so cogently from the noble lord just now <e> <s> has thought been given to the possibility of a joint commonwealth representation to all concerned to implement the cease-fire of their own accord now that the negotiations for a permanent basis for the political and the military agreements proceed <e> <s> it seems to some of us that the commonwealth in lusaka showed great and helpful significance at this juncture and has throughout the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i on behalf of my noble friends on this side of the house say how warmly we welcome what the foreign secretary said in his first reply to my noble friend <e> <s> we wish him godspeed in his efforts this afternoon to secure restraint in the first instance by all concerned in southern africa preparatory to a durable permanent and effective cease-fire <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to ask her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all grateful to the minister for repeating the statement in this house <e> <s> i should like to ask him one or two questions <e> <s> will he confirm or otherwise that certain external and <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to offer general support for what my noble friend lord hatch of lusby has said as to the great advantage of emphasising as much as possible the commonwealths presence during the monitoring procedures as well as the observing procedures which of course as the noble lord lord trefgarne has reminded us are quite distinct <e> <s> is he in a position to tell us how many so far of the commonwealth countries that have been asked whether they would be ready to make commitments to the observer force have in fact replied favourably <e> <s> he said that he was still awaiting replies but it would be encouraging to know whether some have answered favourably <e> <s> secondly is he at the moment in a position to tell the house how he thinks the talks are going today in lancaster house <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord for so clearly setting out the pros and cons of this new accession to the european community <e> <s> as he quite rightly said there is a general welcome for the bill which will of course also have to be considered in relation to the treaty of rome and the treaty of accession a much more extensive document for which this bill is the providing instrument <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to interfere with a very good speech but i am encouraged to do so by what the noble lord has just said <e> <s> i join with the noble lord lord campbell of croy in once more hoping that the application of the general safeguards article will be made if the situation warrants it <e> <s> in the meantime my understanding is that it has up to now been possible for us to have a voluntary bilateral arrangement for the restriction of exports from greece to this country <e> <s> am i right in assuming that on the assumption of full membership that will <e>", "<cs> my lords it makes my point that if the present possibility of voluntary restriction falls away after st january therefore the point so powerfully made by the noble lord lord campbell of croy and others about this government and successive governments really having recourse to article is so much more strengthened as the only alternative <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that his answer to my noble friend will come as a great disappointment to many of us who have looked forward to the raising of the level of representation in this quite strategic country in africa <e> <s> would he give an undertaking that as soon as the immediate necessity for cutting the diplomatic service is past hopefully within the year consideration will once more be given to enhancing the representation in conakry where there is considerable and rising goodwill for this country and pretty considerable opportunities for trade also <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord for making this statement but there are one or two questions which i should like to put to him about it <e> <s> we very warmly welcome the words in the first paragraph of his statement that he is <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly we welcome the statement as indicating that talks continue with the patriotic front <e> <s> some of us thought from press reports that there was an imminent danger of these being cut off <e> <s> that is a very hopeful sign <e> <s> the point we have made is that we very much hope that it is not the intention to go ahead with the action envisaged in the later paragraphs of this statement if a general agreement by all the parties concerned has not first been achieved <e> <s> surely that is a reasonable point to make <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to make it absolutely clear i am sure he will that like their predecessors this government will take every opportunity bilaterally and internationally of denouncing terrorism wherever it arises for whatever pretext and by whoever is responsible <e>", "<cs> my lords may i on a point of information put this question to the minister <e> <s> he is aware is he not that already the foreign and commonwealth office have over the past five or six years pretty well voluntarily effected very substantial savings in manpower and expenditure <e> <s> would he do his best to temper the wind of cuts to this already very shorn lamb as the diplomatic service is already feeling inadequate to the purposes set to it <e> <s> secondly on the question of a review of manpower and expenditure in the <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord answer my point about the <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not increasingly clear that the point is being reached where the arms race especially in the nuclear field is not going to resolve the differences between the nato countries and the warsaw pact countries <e> <s> is it not therefore necessary to effect a radical reappraisal of our approach to both the soviet union and its allies in relation to the whole range of problems throughout the world including those the minister has mentioned the need for stability which is an equal interest and concern for east and west and the need to tackle jointly east and west together the points of contention and of difficulty economic and security that arise in so many parts of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful for the noble lords statement which can only be described as momentous <e> <s> the government clearly have made a crucial decision and they are aware are they not <e> <s> that the decision involves the new governor arriving in zimbabwe-rhodesia before important details of the cease-fire have been agreed <e> <s> are the government aware that we are bound to express our deepest misgivings about this procedure <e> <s> we have tried to be helpful in all our comments on the long-drawn-out and very difficult negotiations which the foreign secretary has conducted with great skill and perseverance but we have said consistently from this side of the house and in another place that until there is a final and durable cease-fire it would be a very great gamble indeed to send a governor out to that country <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be very grateful to the noble and learned occupant of the woolsack for the superb clarity with which he has explained the contents of this very complicated and as he said historic bill <e> <s> it comes to your lordships after second reading in another place and it is not the normal practice of your lordships house to refuse a second reading to a bill which has had that experience in the other place <e> <s> nor indeed do her majestys opposition seek to do that today <e> <s> this however does not mean that the misgivings that we on this side of the house have expressed especially in the last two or three weeks about the timing and sequence of events and action by the government particularly in sending the governor to zimbabwe before a cease-fire had been agreed by all the parties are without foundation <e> <s> we have to repeat those reservations today hoping profoundly that they will be proved to be unfounded as events develop in zimbabwe in the next few days and weeks <e>", "<cs> we have heard repeatedly from the government front bench that the process to which your lordships house is asked to agree is irreversible <e> <s> in the light of that definition of what they are doing now in the name of this country and for rhodesia we have suggested that the mechanism of the affirmative resolution be adopted that would not delay the order by more than a couple of days or failing that and this is a great concession from us that a report either from the commonwealth monitoring force or some other impartial source as to how the elections have gone showing we very much hope and i very much expect that the pre-requisite condition for independence namely properly conducted free and fair elections have in fact taken place <e> <s> i cannot understand why the government first refuse the affirmative resolution procedure and secondly seem unwilling to present a report to your lordships house which we could then look at and say this is all excellent <e> <s> let the date be announced today and we shall all agree to it <e>", "<cs> the noble lord will rue this day it is a great mistake <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he agrees that a number of francophone countries in africa are very anxious indeed to diversify their cultural and commercial connections especially with the united kingdom and that there is a strong argument for not only maintaining the present level of external services to those countries including western africa as we have heard but also even in these difficult times finding some resources to increase them <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that we are all delighted with the news that the final conference report has been initialled <e>", "<cs> may i ask whether the noble lord will confirm that the sum of million which he mentioned in the statement yesterday refers exclusively to the costs of organising the pre-independence arrangements that <e>", "<cs> my lords in reference to what my noble friend lord shinwell said just now would the minister reaffirm that the twin purposes of nato are defence as well as dtente and that it is the intention of this country as a leading member of nato to pursue both objectives at the same time in co-operation with our other allies in nato <e> <s> on a factual question is this expansion which the minister described in his first answer within the per cent <e> <s> limit agreed with our nato allies last year or is it additional to that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i in putting this question to the noble lord join with i am sure everyone in this house in welcoming back in our midst and into very active participation in the proceedings of the house my noble friend lord brockway <e> <s> it would perhaps be a misplaced description of his intervention to describe it as typically aggressive but we look forward to more of that kind of aggression in our discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to intervene again but i am sure the minister will wish to reassure all sections of the house that it is not part of the policy of her majestys government to withdraw from either of the two sets of talks we have been discussing despite our profound disapprobation of soviet actions especially in the last few weeks and our continuing impatience with their unwillingness to talk realistically about mutual disarmament <e> <s> i should like to be reassured that britian will nevertheless continue to show every evidence of being ready to talk in vienna and everywhere else where disarmament proves even faintly possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to ask a private notice question of which i have given previous notice namely <e>", "<cs> my lords we are of course grateful to the minister for repeating the answer in this house <e> <s> however while we on this side of the house and indeed in every part of the house are in favour of normal diplomatic relations with as many countries as possible can the minister tell us what particular developments in chile in recent months have prompted the government to take this step <e> <s> in particular have they received further satisfaction about the case of dr cassidy <e>", "<cs> my lords i will confine myself at this stage to <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble lord to confirm two or three facts about the so-called disarmament negotiations <e> <s> the first matter is that the vienna talks are practically all concentrated on what we call conventional arms with certain overtones of tactical nuclear weapon discussions and nuclear discussions are substantially confined to the salt talks <e> <s> therefore vienna tackles the conventional side <e> <s> secondly on the important point raised by my noble friend about chemical weapons is it not a fact that on british initiative a draft treaty on the banning of chemical weapons was prepared for the geneva committee and it was then that the two super-powers undertook to consider that draft treaty and to return it with their observations to geneva where in fact the enlarged committee of members again the result of british initiative last year or the year before will look at the treaty plus the comments of the two super-powers <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to return to one very important point made by my noble friend lord brockway when he referred to the future of the chemical weapons ban treaty <e> <s> i hope that the minister is in a position to confirm that while that treaty and its provisions have been given to the superpowers for their study and comments it is understood that they will return it to the geneva committee which has now been enlarged so that there will be final participation by a wide range of countries about the ultimate proposals of a chemical warfare ban treaty <e> <s> it will return to geneva will it not <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to ask her majestys government the question of which i have given private notice namely <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank the minister for <e>", "<cs> my lords may i warmly welcome the foreign secretarys answer to my noble friend lord brockways supplementary question <e> <s> namely that proper and forceful denunciation of the action of the russians in imperilling peace and stability in afghanistan and the near east must <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is very grateful to the noble lord the foreign and commonwealth secretary for coming here to make the statement that he has made a statement of the utmost importance and possibly with momentous implications <e> <s> it was a very long statement and a very comprehensive one <e> <s> here and there it was a little less clear than one would have hoped but as one who in the past has taken part in preparing statements of this kind i am bound to say that it was remarkably expressive of the mood and intentions of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords while going along with the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the house will wish to support the minister in his motion that we should approve this order <e> <s> the order <e>", "<cs> i was hoping not to make too strong a point of that or to arouse too much applause about it but as a former rapporteur of the budgetary committee in strasbourg my noble friend of course knows his way in and out of these matters very well <e> <s> this places us in a very good position <e> <s> we have less need to watch this matter and introduce new provisions than perhaps some of our competitors <e> <s> to that extent we shall be the gainers by the increased virtue of our competitors compared with the less necessary adventition of virtue in our case <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister help us in this matter can he tell us more about the response of the community that is the commission to the motion passed by the european parliament particularly in the matter of exports at cut prices to the soviet union <e> <s> is it not a fact that while the community will not make up the shortfall in the delivery of grain resulting from the decision of the united states government in that area nevertheless the export of important cereals such as barley is to go ahead apace in very significant quantities and at greatly reduced prices <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the foreign and commonwealth secretary for making the statement available to it and join with him once more in deploring most strongly attacks on persons and property in rhodesia at this time when we are all hoping that the elections may proceed on a fair and free basis <e> <s> what he has said about the latest attack on mr mugabes house is most upsetting and one very much hopes that all concerned in rhodesia to whatever party they belong will see the necessity for restraining their followers as well as themselves from action of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter deserves the warmest thanks of the house for the admirable speech with which he opened the debate <e> <s> once more he displayed an enviable combination of parliamentary skill and intellectual clarity <e> <s> we also had what was technically a maiden speech but it is very difficult to listen to the noble lord lord holderness and to sympathise with him on speaking for the first time in parliament because those of us who have experience of his distinguished contributions in the other place knew what to expect this evening and indeed we were not disappointed <e> <s> he as much as anybody deserves the respectful attention of this and every other place for his most distinguished service to this country and to democracy in war and peace <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that a great many elements both in france and west germany and in the rest of europe will welcome the noble earls understanding almost as much as if he had approved <e> <s> in these circumstances to understand is to go some way to approving <e> <s> the fact is that relatively short-term economic gain is felt to be more important than the vital longer-term purpose of true european unity and an effective answer to the incursions of dictatorship <e> <s> i hope the situation will change <e> <s> so far i see very little evidence of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the fact that feelings run very deep on this issue <e> <s> we have heard them expressed today notably by those who have pressed us to accord an inevitable political importance to the games <e> <s> we have also had speakers like the noble marquess lord exeter who urged us to continue with the games since they are a means of international understanding and friendship <e> <s> as i say feelings run very deep indeed <e> <s> i wish there were other aspects of the situation which evoked feelings quite as deep and here i must confess that i agree to some extent <e>", "<cs> my lords it was to run for five years from was it not <e> <s> had the russians taken up only per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there is pretty well unanimous support for the views expressed in this house this afternoon about the enormities perpetrated by the soviet government especially in the last year or so against human rights in that country and elsewhere <e> <s> nevertheless we would support a thoughtful approach to the question of whether to participate in meetings such as that in hamburg especially those which stem from the belgrade conference which will be with others reporting to the madrid conference later this year <e> <s> so while condemnation of soviet practices must continue unabated with the full support of the house delicacy about various contacts which may prove useful and helpful to people now in duress in the soviet union should also be borne in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord for repeating that important statement in the house but is the noble lord aware that the statement he has just made confirms the mounting concern in this country and abroad about the deterioration of the situation in rhodesia <e> <s> is he further aware that the action taken under the ordinance which the governor has enacted enabling him to suspend elections in any area may well nullify the result of the election as a whole and give a talking point to the basic enemies of the democratic process to denounce the election and to resume other means of settling the rhodesia problem <e> <s> may i suggest strongly that every effort be made to avoid using this particular ordinance <e>", "<cs> a former prime minister of rhodesia who commands wide respect among black africans and not a little among white africans as well and whose arrest by the present government of rhodesia was more drastic even than the treatment meted out to him by the smith regime who after all only confined him to his farm <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect and with the permission of the house may i emphasise one or two points <e> <s> will the minister and her majestys government both here and in rhodesia they are both her majestys governments bear in mind the important distinction between strengthening the civilian technicians who will supervise the actual polling and the electoral arrangements as they would presumably in a by-election in this country and the need to strengthen what is sometimes called the monitoring force but which i have chosen to call the forces applying law and order from sources seen by everybody in rhodesia to be impartial <e> <s> i leave it at that <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord confirm that this country in the united nations and indeed in southern and central africa is lending its fullest support to general chands very hopeful initiative under the aegis of the united nations that we place the utmost importance upon the creation and thereafter the maintenance of i think the -kilometre demilitarised zone on both sides of the northern border and also that there is no question of any existing so-called assembly in namibia usurping what properly will be the powers of a regularly elected and constituted assembly after stability has been achieved in that country <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask her majestys government the question of which i have given private notice <e> <s> the question is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for making that statement to the house <e> <s> may i ask him whether he is aware that we on this side of the house and i am sure the entire house strongly support the governor in his efforts to prevent political intimidation in rhodesia and his action in consulting the party leaders in rhodesia for that purpose <e> <s> we feel that it is in the interests of the party leaders and the parties in rhodesia that this should be done and certainly in the interests of the rhodesian people as a whole <e> <s> we entirely agree that investigations into the identity of those responsible for actions of violence particularly at this time including the bombings in salisbury on the night of th february should be pursued with vigour <e> <s> we also greatly appreciate the action of the members of our own police force in volunteering for duty as polling station supervisors but we still feel that it is even more necessary to strengthen the forces which will preserve order between now and polling day <e>", "<cs> my lords i am mindful of the fact that the rules of debate require that i should be as brief as possible to enable the noble lord to speak during a given time and to <e>", "<cs> my lords may i join the noble lord in asserting that for very many people on both sides of the house the political priority activated our desire to join the market <e> <s> i say once more than unless and until the economics of the market are drastically overhauled and the obvious enormous unfairness to this country is put right that very priority of political co-operation and unity will be imperilled <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also from this bench very strongly approve of and support what the noble lord lord todd has said at hamburg on behalf of british and free world science <e> <s> may i also support the view taken i believe by the secretary of state that these contacts must be selectively encouraged when on balance they will help the cause of democracy and the humane freedoms more than they will militate against them that the thing to do is to be selective about these contacts not to abrogate them totally without due thought in each case <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put this point to the foreign secretary is he aware that there is considerable concern and disquiet about these two cases which may be examples of a more widespread treatment of others in a fairly similar position <e> <s> may i ask why there should be any restriction at all by this properly-constituted government a british government on any of these three people <e> <s> why should they be interviewed handed papers headed prohibited immigrant given three days and then two months in much the same way as they would have been treated by the illegal smith government <e> <s> why <e>", "<cs> so now we have it <e> <s> because my noble <e>", "<cs> indeed it is my lords <e> <s> now it is out reservations about government policy and even about the governors actions from time to time reservations which have been expressed in this house and therefore he suddenly becomes a prohibited immigrant in the smith sense <e>", "<cs> my lords that is what it comes to <e> <s> the noble lord said that these people were classified as prohibited immigrants for a variety of reasons <e> <s> is there any reason other than the political views of lord and lady hatch and bishop lamont for them to be still prohibited immigrants under the present rgime <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister like to confirm that it has been and is the policy of successive british governments to regard with constructive sympathy all proposals for regional arms control and disarmament including nuclear-free zones <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister did not hear the report on the radio this morning perhaps by chance he saw the very circumstantial and detailed report by a reputable correspondent in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble earl for the care he takes in answering this question which concerns members on both sides of the house <e> <s> could he tell us whether the new tender system will result in a lower subsidy on the price to for instance russia than the old system which amounted to a subsidy of p per pound a subsidy which would be most acceptable to the british housewife <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord lord carrington for so promptly coming to the house to make that very important statement may i ask whether he is aware that we would all wish to congratulate mr robert mugabe on his electoral victory and wish him well in the immense tasks that face him and his people in the future in particular the task of reuniting a country which has only recently emerged from a long period of destruction and bloodshed and that of building a true democracy a free society and a prosperous economy <e> <s> does the noble lord further agree that it is the wish of the government of the united kingdom and of all sections of the people of the united kingdom to establish from the very start of the emergence of the new state of zimbabwe relations of strong friendship and wide-ranging co-operation as rhodesia emerges as the sovereign independent state of zimbabwe and we hope a member of the commonwealth <e>", "<cs> my lords with the indulgence of the house may i intervene very briefly to make two points <e> <s> i would very much like to add to what i said earlier in my personal appreciation of the role played by the foreign and commonwealth secretary <e> <s> it is so obvious that perhaps i missed him in the list of people i mentioned as deserving our appreciation <e> <s> i join with him of course in the view that the time for congratulation is at the outcome of these events <e> <s> if congratulation is for the future surely appreciation may be tolerated for the interim <e> <s> as i have said previously in the house <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put two points to the noble lord <e> <s> did i hear him aright to say that even if the russians were to withdraw from afghanistan we would still not be advising or allowing our sportsmen to go to moscow <e> <s> if that is what is said it would seem to me to be an imbalance of assessment <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord would clarify that point <e> <s> the second point is this <e> <s> the noble lord said that our government are advising our sportsmen against going to moscow <e> <s> does that advice apply to the british media particularly the television medium <e>", "<cs> my lords my second point was this will the government give the same advice to the british media particularly the television medium about going to moscow as they are now giving to our sportsmen <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that our practice in this matter stems fundamentally from our accession to the various geneva agreements which bind a large number of countriesand secondly from the obligations we incur like other signatories when we accede to protocols to agreements in regard to specific international arrangements <e> <s> further will he confirm my impression i think it is fairly well-founded but i should like it confirmed that this country accords this type of privilege and immunity very much to the same extent and to the same numbers of personnel as comparable countries like for example the republic of france and western germany do <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to my noble friend lady white for the admirable way in which she initiated this useful and timely debate <e> <s> we also are very well aware of the fact that although she has not been in the chair of the select committee for a very long time she has already given ample evidence of her great capabilities <e> <s> todays speech like its predecessor was an example of what i mean <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has quoted what was on the tip of my tongue to quote but one does not want to put one organisation against another <e> <s> however it is perfectly true <e> <s> many members in the middle echelons of the commission i am sure because i know a few who have said this to me point to that example <e> <s> it works extremely well <e> <s> those of us who deal with documentation either in government or in opposition know that it works <e> <s> indeed with a few more languages i believe four the united nations organisation has shown that it can get along with fewer than nine <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords will all this get us anywhere <e> <s> do we go on having these injunctions these judgments with nothing at all in effect happening <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that his remarks about hong kong and the extraordinary efforts which the governor the government and the people of hong kong have made to help in this appallingly difficult problem would be greatly appreciated in the colony <e> <s> we on this side of the house would like to associate ourselves very markedly with what he and the noble earl have said about the contribution of hong kong to at least a partial amelioration of this immense human tragedy in this part of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords much as we enjoy the ministers flippancies on these occasions is he aware that many of us feel that the noble viscount lord massereene and ferrard has raised a matter of some importance <e> <s> may i ask whether the minister would look at this matter in the light of the fact that there arc still some crafts in this country which are unique in a world connection and are uniquely british <e> <s> is he aware that it would be a great pity if through the rather arbitrary operation of a flat rate vat certain very precious very valuable and quite unique crafts which are equally arts were gradually to be lost by this country <e>", "<cs> my lords before i put a supplementary question to the foreign secretary may i say how delighted we are to welcome back home the noble lord load soames who is looking so well unaccountably well after a very trying yet very successful time spent in the service of this country in zimbabwe <e> <s> may i also say how much we appreciate the way in which <e>", "<cs> my lords may i very briefly but very strongly endorse what the noble lord the foreign secretary has said <e> <s> it is necessary to get everybody in the middle east into peaceful orderly discussion <e> <s> at the same time it is the policy of this country whichever government are in power to sustain and secure a free independent israel <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to give an enthusiastic <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble lord lord trefgarne for moving the second reading of this bill in such clear terms <e> <s> it regularises one or two anomalies as he said and one of them is an irish anomaly that must be particularly acceptable in any statute <e> <s> but the more general anomaly to which he drew attention is one that i am sure the house will be pleased to know is finally regularised that is that at present the power to charge fees for consular services is confined to consular officers <e> <s> as the noble lord said there is no requirement in the vienna convention that these services should be confined to officers bearing consular titles in fact there is and has been for some years a single diplomatic service a foreign service one might call it for overseas purposes in this country <e> <s> the bill proposes that fees for a consular service should be payable whenever and by whichever officer the service is rendered <e> <s> that surely should help to make the use of diplomatic service manpower more flexible especially in small missions and particularly as mini-missions of two or three people are beginning to emerge <e>", "<cs> my lords may i very strongly support what my noble friend lord hatch has said on this matter and the appreciation which he has voiced which i think is shared throughout the house of the way in which the new government and the new prime minister of zimbabwe have looked to this country of their own volition for help in the scope and nature of their own security forces which no doubt zimbabweans themselves will indicate to our military personnel <e> <s> is it not most encouraging that in zimbabwe this vital part of africa there is this good feeling towards this country which we all wish to reciprocate in every possible way <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that the minister in answering a most responsible question from a most responsible source a question which is echoed in the minds of some of us in this house said that these educational premises will be deemed to be used for educational purposes would they not even though they are to be used for private education be subject to a form of periodic inspection as to what goes on there <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may put one or two points to the minister <e> <s> would he confirm that the united kingdom took a leading part in preparing a perfectly workable chemical warfare ban agreement for presentation to the disarmament committee in geneva as we had done with the biological warfare ban agreement to which he has just referred and that that draft of british authorship was handed over to the united states and the soviet union or was taken over by them the expectation being that they would achieve a consensus and then present their findings to the disarmanent committee in geneva but that little progress has been made by the super-powers in that respect <e> <s> would the minister further confirm that although the united states has run down its chemical warfare capacity to the point of near obsolescence at the same time there is clear evidence that the russians have not only maintained but developed their own <e> <s> this gives very great concern not only to this country but to the whole world lest the united states in the absence of co-operation by the soviet union in this vital field may feel obliged to resume its capacity for chemical warfare and so despite its past efforts <e>", "<cs> my lords may we take it that her majestys government have continued to impress upon the south african government the danger of further delay in settling the namibian question <e> <s> secondly may we assume that there is in the successful solution of the zimbabwe question an exemplar for a similar solution in namibia <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that from this side of the house there would be very warm support for the spirit motivating the question put by the noble lord lord gridley <e> <s> may i also thank the minister for giving us those impressive statistics and facts about the contribution made by rhodesians of all creeds and colours at a time when the democracy which has now been set up in zimbabwe was last challenged <e>", "<cs> my lords may i join the noble lord in something he said in his reply <e> <s> the settlement which he is seeking and which was sought by previous governments must be comprehensive otherwise it will neither be just nor durable <e> <s> that brings in the fundamental question of relating the rights of the palestinians to the undoubted rights of israel <e>", "<cs> my lords may i very warmly congratulate the noble lord on the results of his efforts in reinforcing the age-old friendship between this country and spain and particularly on his success in getting a constructive dialogue resumed between us on a number of outstanding questions including of course the important question of movement by land and air between gibraltar and spain <e> <s> may i express to him our hope that although this may be a long haul there will be as speedy as possible a termination of these restrictions which are vexatious and mutually damaging damaging to trade and damaging to psychology in that they postpone rather than accelerate the possibility of a larger settlement between us the gibraltarians and spain <e> <s> finally may i most warmly endorse what he said about the views of the gibraltarians themselves being the final deciding factor in any possibility of a constitutional change in their status <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may with the indulgence of the house intervene once more may i ask whether the foreign secretary recalls the extremely useful and successful visit by a parliamentary delegation from spain under the aegis of our own branch of the inter-parliamentary union last december <e> <s> it was led by his excellency senor lavilla speaker of the spanish national congress and the very strong good feeling between this country and spain especially democratic spain was made very evident <e> <s> no doubt he will look concomitantly with his own efforts to further contacts at the parliamentary level between the two parliaments <e> <s> that is very useful <e>", "<cs> my <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene briefly and start with an apology <e> <s> i have already explained to the minister and to my noble friend who initiated this debate that unfortunately i shall not be able to stay for the rest of this extremely fascinating debate <e> <s> it contains debates within the debate which i found equally diverting <e> <s> like my noble friend lord gladwyn we all look forward to a more expansive occasion on which we can have a good look at how things have gone in zimbabwe and how we should all seek to assist that country in the future when the governor-general has returned and takes his place and makes his statement from that dispatch box <e> <s> in the meantime i think that my noble friend is entirely justified in raising the points that he has done just in case there is no other opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole house will warmly welcome the statement made by the noble lord and we thank him for coming to the house to keep us abreast of the situation <e> <s> i am also sure that the entire house will feel that the choice of his royal highness the prince of wales to be one of our principal representatives at the celebrations is most appropriate an appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put this point to the minister from what he said in his first answer and indeed followed up in his answer to the supplementary can we take it that there will continue to be official contacts between the two bodies aimed largely at getting so far as possible a similarity of structure on both sides leading to composite negotiation on the lines he <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord confirm that zimbabwe as a member of the commonwealth will have access to the resources of the commonwealth development corporation separately from and independently of the million we are making available for the three years from treasury funds in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that for many years indeed since the south african republic took on itself the occupation and therefore the administration of former south west africa this country like other countries has refused to recognise that situation <e> <s> nevertheless as the noble lord says is it not also a fact that the mandatory content of the united nations response to this situation is as he has said <e> <s> the third question that i should like to put to the noble lord and indeed to the house is as follows do not these exchanges reinforce the argument for pressing ahead with every possible speed to secure for namibia an orderly and democratic procedure into independence on the analogy of what we have achieved in rhodesia <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the foreign secretary for the statement that he has made <e> <s> may i ask whether he is aware that there will be general accord in all quarters of the house and i imagine in the other place and in the country with the agreement reached yesterday as to how at this stage to support the united states in the very difficult and dangerous situation that is continuing to develop in tehran and how to make absolutely clear in concert with all civilised countries our abhorrence of this flagrant breaking of international law defiance of the international court and persistent cruelty to these hostages and to their families at home <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is extremely grateful to my noble friend lord noel-baker for this opportunity of debating this extremely important question <e> <s> before i make a number of remarks about his speech may i pay my respects with the rest of the house to the noble lord lord ritchie of dundee for a most impressive maiden speech and following as i do my noble <e>", "<cs> my lords may i briefly intervene <e> <s> the noble lord has made a statement of very considerable importance <e> <s> he will recall that in the debate in another place on th january the government were specifically pressed to make sure that there was full investigation and full debate in the house and in the country on the question of a possible post-polaris programme before a decision was announced <e> <s> the noble lord has just said that a decision is imminent <e> <s> we would take very grave exception indeed very serious exception to a decision which was announced to the country as the decision of the british government to proceed with a post-polaris programme without first ensuring what i have described as a full investigation of the need and of the options and a full debate based on the kind of full information that we heard the noble lord lord zuckerman and others refer to <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i have made the point <e> <s> it is not that i expect the government to give adequate consideration to this matter <e> <s> what i am pressing for as my right honourable friend did in another place <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i do not want to detain the house but having been non-detentive on the polaris issue just now perhaps i might be allowed to express my pleasure at hearing these assurances from the noble lord <e> <s> they are of immense importance that despite soviet negativity the motives for which may he various nevertheless this offer this package remains on the table that nato and we with nato are determined to press forward with these very constructive proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell us what is the status of the british draft treaty to <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the foreign secretary the question of which i have given private notice to him relating to our relations with saudi arabia <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord for making that statement may i ask whether he will continue to assure the royal house and the people of the kingdom of saudi arabia of the widespread and genuine understanding and respect there is in this country at this time for saudi arabian feelings and that we very greatly value the long-standing friendship between our two countries tested in peace and in war <e> <s> it is a friendship which has brought considerable political and economic benefit to both countries as the noble lord reminded us <e> <s> will the noble lord also assure saudi arabia that we greatly hope that our relationship will very soon be fully restored so that our two countries may continue together to do everything in our power to ensure the stability and the security of the middle and near east particularly the gulf area <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has had one go <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord whether he is aware that there is general agreement in condemning this kind of abomination whoever is responsible for it <e> <s> but is he further aware to put it like this that it is not <e>", "<cs> my lords we thank the noble lord for making that statement <e> <s> on behalf of her majestys opposition may i ask him whether he is aware that this is really a statement on three distinct sets of discussions by the council <e> <s> first there is the question of political co-operation and may i ask him whether he is aware that we welcome the emphasis which the council have placed on the absolute necessity for every government in the world whatever its political attitudes to respect the charter of the united nations and to act in consonance with it particularly in relation to afghanistan and iran <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there would be very considerable support in more than one party and section in this country for what my noble friend lord hatch has suggested <e> <s> is he aware that we would welcome a somewhat more forthcoming indication of the governments thoughts for the widest possible dissemination and public study of this very valuable report particularly in view of the fact that the experience of rhodesia of leading a dependency peacefully into effective independence may serve us well when we tackle the more difficult problem of namibia <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all very grateful to the noble lord lord drumalbyn for the way he introduced this important report <e> <s> we are also grateful for the very useful and balanced report which the subcommittee produced under his chairmanship <e> <s> the tokyo declaration of invited all countries to consider a very wide-ranging series of policies designed to liberalise world trade and to improve the economic prospects of the underdeveloped countries <e> <s> this report helps us to assess the results of those negotiations to liberalise world trade and to improve the lot of underdeveloped countries negotiations which lasted

make good the damage done by the previous presentation of the bill in another place <e> <s> if i raise one or two points of reservation they will equally be points of suggestion designed to make the

similar group in this country independent of the foreign and commonwealth office although acting with its full approval to the one that was set up before the belgrade meeting in - <e> <s> can the minister also tell us whether the united states congress which produced a very useful report before the belgrade conference in has similarly been engaged in preparation for the madrid conference <e>",

discussions which did not figure in todays statement namely our great concern as to how things are going in the exchanges about afghanistan <e> <s> no doubt the foreign secretary as he always does

personally <e> <s> there can be no disagreement in this house or indeed in the country about the enormity of what the russians have done in afghanistan or the need to make the strongest possible

view abundantly clear <e> <s> i merely paid tribute to the fact that he asked us all to respect the motivation even of those who do not agree with him and possibly with me <e>", "<cs> my lords we are

aware of them <e> <s> jimmy stevens and his backers have signalled their intentions for quite a long time and indeed ministers assured parliament as early as last november if my memory serves me

be most loath to make the governments task more difficult than it is <e> <s> nobody knows better than i how difficult can be the operation of a condominium even with ones best friends <e> <s> but the situation is beyond the last resort <e> <s> from the facts that have come to me in the last few minutes and from new evidence i think that we are faced with the possibility that this territory may be so shattered by the actions of the authors of this takeover in santo that long before the date agreed for independence we may be faced with total disarray <e> <s> what i think the noble lord lord gladwyn and i would jointly urge in the most co-operative and friendly way is that action should be taken quickly <e> <s> the american assurances are gratifying <e> <s> one would hope that they would add to a study of the legal implications of this action the immediate possibility of political action among their own nationals where they are involved in this operation <e>", "<cs> my lords will the

murray maclehose were given the very greatest weight possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with my noble friend lord brockway about the need to do everything possible to promote political stability based on democracy in uganda and i welcome very much the reference that the minister has made to the commonwealth secretariat <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord without having given him previous notice whether we may expect an early statement perhaps in this house and in another place about the situation in uganda arising from the quite horrifying effects of the widespread famine in that country in the last two or three months <e> <s> if an initiative were taken in regard to putting down a private notice question would the noble lord convey to his noble friend the fact that the whole house would appreciate an opportunity to hear what the government think can be done with others to alleviate the situation in uganda <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister knows of course that these orders have been very heavily criticised by the joint committee on statutory instruments and in another place but one would hardly think so from listening to the speech with which the noble lord introduced the orders <e> <s> in another place the government have admitted that these orders are difficult to defend <e> <s> in fact they are indefensible <e> <s> they are shot through with weaknesses as their spokesman in another place has had to admit <e> <s> one is bound to ask if so why are they being proposed at all <e> <s> the simple answer as has already been given by the

in aid to enable the secretary of state to vary the amount of penalty on a delinquent exporter <e>", "<cs> then i have it wrong my lords <e> <s> in that case what is the purpose of that section of the

for making this important statement to your lordships house <e> <s> the political content of it is of course rather slight but the intention was to discuss economic matters perhaps more than political questions <e>", "<cs> my lords may i strongly support the intentions behind the questions put to the minister this afternoon by my noble friends but ask him whether he will confirm that now as in the past her majestys government equally denounce the actions in afghanistan and in south africa and equally advise our sportsmen to decide not to participate in the olympics and in south african sports

let us know how many signatories are attached to this treaty which is really an agreement with schedules and whether the total signatories include in reasonably equal proportion representatives of the industrialised west the opec countries and the soviet union and its allies in the east <e>", "<cs> my lords while appreciating most profoundly the honourable concern of the noble lord lord gridley may i ask whether the minister would agree that unless and until the international authority of the red cross approaches the government with a view to making representations whether jointly or diplomatically to the present afghan government it is not for the government to move <e>", "<cs> my lords while i appreciate the points that the noble lord lord gridley is making may i ask the foreign secretary from this side of the house whether he is satisfied that the spanish government have acted within the two international agreements the one relating to the -mile zone and the other relating to whaling and that in addition to that the procedures relating to british subjects are continuing in a way which is satisfactory to her majestys government that is to say that the spanish government is acting correctly in regard to the case itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all extremely grateful to my noble friend lord stewart of fulham for the admirable way in which he opened this debate <e> <s> he has brought to your lordships house distinguished experience as a former secretary of state as well as a practical idealism qualities which were amply in evidence in his speech today <e> <s> we also appreciate the constructive clarity with which the foreign secretary spoke this evening <e> <s> he was indeed a little disparaging of our motion but i thought his own speech by its structure and content was the clearest evidence possible that the four themes we had introduced into the motion were indeed closely related as i think my noble friend lord brockway showed <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not refer to this because i did not want to detain the house too long and because many of my noble friends had made the point so eloquently may i ask the minister to address himself to a question which was put to him about how far we were helping to strengthen the united nations emergencies reserve fund <e> <s> this is strategically important to deal with sudden crises arising from sudden natural phenomena <e>", "<cs> my lords will the british delegation be led by a minister or by an ambassador <e> <s> secondly will there be the most effective co-ordination among the western countries represented there covering their attitudes and proposals in regard to the preparation of the agenda and agreement to the procedures of the conference and the proceedings of the committees and the plenary conference itself <e> <s> also in particular in view of our experience at the belgrade meeting in will there be the closest co- ordination on this occasion with the united states delegation <e>", "<cs> my lords including in particular that of the united states of america <e>", "<cs> my lords i crave your lordships indulgence for speaking again but this is an extremely important matter <e> <s> can we take it that there has been an independent review of the performance of the helsinki agreement including the vital point made by my noble friend similar to the review conducted with the support of but not controlled by the foreign office two years ago before the belgrade meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that for a long time now the whole policy of the south african government has been to thwart the intentions of the united nations in regard to namibia to be in default of the unanimously adopted resolution relating to that country to prevent the creation of a democracy and a free state in namibia and thereby to imperil the very hopeful example of zimbabwe and to place the future peace of southern africa as a whole in grave jeopardy <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that answer may i ask whether her majestys government are aware that we welcome the fact that these two examinations are proceeding in parallel <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that it is obviously important that the two super-powers should agree on a matter of this sort but that also the enlarged and more representative disarmament committee in geneva should also come to its conclusions <e> <s> finally can the noble lord give me an assurance that her majestys government will now work for the unification of the two studies so that the final result which we shall all welcome will emanate from the disarmament committee in geneva and not necessarily solely from the two super-powers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for his forthcoming answer to my supplementary <e> <s> he well understands the point that i have put to him <e> <s> will her majestys government and other governments look at this class of disarmament proposal in the light of the fairly considerable success already achieved in comparable areas of disarmament namely environmental warfare and biological warfare <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister further confirm that both houses have been assured that when the decision is made there will be an opportunity for discussing that decision possibly in a full-scale debate <e> <s> adverting to his former answer will the minister confirm that even though the decision may be imminent nevertheless that does not affect the possibility of continuing discussions with whoever is interested with a view to negotiating a better disarmament or arms control situation in this field than at present seems to be possible <e> <s> that is to say will he confirm that the announcement of the decision will not preclude the possibility of further negotiation <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree of course that the geneva discussions necessarily technical and protracted as they must be will take some more time before we may expect results in this field <e> <s> nevertheless may i put a question to the minister and hope that he will take it up with his right honourable friend <e> <s> could he suggest that there might be made a definitive statement of the progress already made in the infce discussions i hope that the house will not expect me to elucidate that particular acronym it would take the scope of a full supplementary question to do so in which we are i think co-chairmen with the japanese on this aspect of nuclear arms control though my memory does not serve me very well on this <e> <s> these discussions address themselves not only to the question of proliferation which is the great danger today but also to the point raised by my noble friend which cannot be brushed aside as being fanciful namely the interference of certain underground tests with the environment and even with climatic conditions <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord ask his right honourable friend to consider a definitive statement on the progress in the discussions which i mentioned infce on proliferation <e> <s> no doubt he is aware that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put this point to the minister is it right to say that what he has said today is really a decision in principle and that no agreement has been signed with the united states or anybody else so far and no contracts concluded <e> <s> would it be right to say that there is nothing binding on this country and on the government in what he has said today and that therefore there is time to consider the documents to which he has referred and indeed for both houses to consider this matter in depth and that there is indeed time to follow up any possibility of negotiation between us and our allies on one side and anybody else as to a decision on this important matter which may overreach this particular decision <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government made any further progress in persuading our closest friends and allies to join in the very necessary operation of rehabilitating zimbabwe <e> <s> would her majestys government agree that land settlement in zimbabwe could make an extremely important contribution not only to that countrys economic progress but to political stability generally in central and southern africa <e>", "<cs> my lords with the indulgence of the house may i ask the noble lord to draw the attention of his noble friend the foreign secretary i am sure that it is not necessary to draw the attention of the leader of the house to the implications of these exchanges that this is not just a question <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether the chief difficulty here is still the different interpretations on both sides of the structure and therefore the economic validity of the two organisations that is to say the eec take a different view as to how they should deal with their regional counterparts in the east from the view of the east and the question of bilateral agreements is therefore still very much in the balance <e>", "<cs> my lords quite apart from the acceptability of swapo to the united nations for the purpose of negotiating the independence of south-west africa would it not be wise to follow the same procedures as proved so signally successful in zimbabwe namely to introduce into the negotiations all organisations which substantially represent any sector of opinion within the country concerned <e> <s> while swapo is as the minister has reminded us by no means the only organisation nevertheless it is one of the major organisations that speak for the people in namibia and therefore ought to be included in any meaningful and successful negotiations <e>",

elected government of the new hebrides has been effectively restored over the whole of its territory <e> <s> it is particularly gratifying that this has happened through the resumed co-operation of the condominial parties the united kingdom and france and that the operation which was essentially a police operation was carried out without casualties and indeed without firing a shot <e> <s> i

he is not only audible but credible on this matter <e> <s> is he aware that the balance to which my noble friend lord george-brown referred in resolutions and is very well reflected in the original answer which the noble and learned lord gave to the question asked this afternoon in that there is no question of the future integrity and security of israel being placed in jeopardy by any discussions on an international level which may come about as we hope in the next few months and no individual or organisation should come anywhere near such a conference unless it first totally abrogates the policy of the destruction of israel <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble and learned lord agree on behalf of her majestys government that all these issues including that of the future of jerusalem cannot finally be settled except by mutual agreement at a properly convened and representative conference to deal with the future of the area <e> <s> secondly does he agree that attendance at such a conference must obviously depend as the noble and learned lord himself said here yesterday on the total abrogation by any individual or organisation of the intention to destroy another member of that projected conference <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that among the countries which impose no quotas or tariffs on textile imports from this country is hong kong and that the government of that country are actually in favour of the expansion of british exports to them <e> <s> in view of the fact that hong kong is i believe next to the soviet union the largest net

have been shipped to santo from one hears the united states of america <e> <s> it would be helpful if the minister could dispose of that rumour <e> <s> some of us believe that such rumours are unfounded but i am not aware that there has been a ministerial statement to this effect <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord can help the house <e>", "<cs> my lords may i in supporting my noble friend in his purpose of speeding up the settlement of the namibian question welcome very much the tone and content of the foreign secretarys statement today <e> <s> we all hope very much indeed that the security council will be able to convene <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us whether the government are giving further consideration to the conclusions and recommendations of the brandt commission on this particular matter <e> <s> especially in view of the fact that throughout the world not least in the developing countries there is a widespread feeling that the governments initial attention to the brandt report a very prestigious and substantial document was perfunctory in the extreme <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the house will wish to raise any objection to the <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord for making the statement in this place as it has been made in the other place <e> <s> it is important to keep parliament informed of all discussions relating to an issue quite as sensitive as this is <e> <s> so far as i can see there is nothing in this statement today which in any way weakens still less contravenes what was said as recently as last thursday in this house by the foreign secretary when in answer to his noble friend lord morris he said <e>", "<cs> my lords while agreeing with my noble friend as to the desirability of zonal neutralisation in the indian ocean may i put this specific question about diego garcia to the noble lord have the government of mauritius responded favourably to the suggestion by the united kingdom that when diego garcia is no longer needed for technical purposes it will be handed over to them <e>", "<cs> my lords the house would wish to thank the noble lord the foreign secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords is it a fact that these figures actual military personnel and another or so in support represent a remarkable escalation over the past year or so <e> <s> as i recall and perhaps the house may also recall we were all concerned about a year ago because cuban military personnel were present mostly in angola <e> <s> i should also like to ask the noble lord this is the concentration mostly in southern angola and has he reason to think that this will exacerbate the position in namibia which is now hopefully moving slowly towards a solution <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us whether the preparatory work the preparation of the agenda and the scope and purpose of the conference is already in hand <e> <s> the conference is to be held in june and will he agree that time is relatively short for the kind of work that is necessary to make such a conference of any utility at all to those who attend it <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what the minister has said may i ask him how strongly we in this country are through the united nations and the disarmament commission pressing this very vital point with the peoples republic of china <e> <s> the comprehensive test ban treaty was signed by all the major nuclear countries of the world including the soviet union and this country as far back as and a very great deal of it in fact most of it was due to the initiative of the then foreign secretary the noble lord lord home <e> <s> it is now years hence and still a major power and potentially a very important nuclear power is not a signatory and from all accounts is to some extent at least exploding in the atmosphere <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord for explaining this bill with such clarity and conciseness <e> <s> i shall confine myself to two or three practical points which i hope the noble lord may be able to answer today or perhaps he will impart the information to the house in his own way later <e> <s> welcome as this is as an extension of the powers and work of the parliamentary commissioner for administration surely this will add to the work of his office <e> <s> we are all aware of the great increase in the number of british citizens who have taken up residence for varying periods some of them pretty well permanently for business and professional purposes in other countries in particular since the war and of the very great increase in the number of british citizens who qualify under this bill and i shall not go into the definition for the moment who for holiday study or business reasons spend varying portions of the year in various overseas countries <e> <s> the number is increasing all the time <e> <s> therefore the potential demand on the work of the public administrator is likely to increase <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no question of the noble lord having misled anybody <e> <s> it is that the noble lord lord shepherd who like me has some experience of these matters in the foreign office is anxious as we all are to get the question of definitions and therefore of functions clear <e> <s> business education professions private families all need to know this <e> <s> i quote from a useful document which i think emanates from the foreign office <e> <s> it describes the bill as being the parliamentary commissioner consular complaints bill and goes on to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not detain the house <e> <s> i notice a great many noble lords already fastening their seat belts and other noble lords unfastening theirs <e> <s> the noble lord has already answered most of the principal questions that i intended to put to him <e> <s> therefore i content myself by saying that we welcome the bill <e> <s> in one sense it is a consolidating measure <e> <s> in another sense it makes good the real deficiencies of the act particularly in certain directions including the glaring anomaly of not conferring on our representatives in europe the western <e>", "<cs> my lords although entirely agreeing with what the noble lord said towards the end of his answer just now in addition to the highly commendable <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord ritchie-calder deserves our warmest thanks for introducing this important debate and for the manner in which he did so <e> <s> it is right that we should from time to time attempt an assessment of the role and contribution of the united kingdom in the work of the united nations in the general assembly in the security council of which we are a permanent member and in the special agencies and similar institutions which carry on what i think sometimes is the major and possibly some of the best work of the united nations <e> <s> as my noble friend lord noel-baker said it is easy to decry the united nations for its many mistakes but we need only envisage a situation in the world in which there were no united nations and indeed if there were not like voltaires god i suspect it would have to be invented <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that a more worthy recipient in contemporary circumstances would be poland <e> <s> is this country in full support of the eec intention to send foodstuffs to poland <e> <s> can the noble lord give details of the value and volume and any indication of a subsidised price for these items if indeed they are subsidised <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord indicate what the price per kilo or pound was and whether or not a subsidy was involved in that case as in the russian case <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also preface my supplementary question to the noble viscount by saying that this is certainly a house and a country where one may politically deplore but personally rejoice and will he therefore accept from me my congratulations on his elevation <e> <s> is he aware that there is a considerable body of technical opinion in more than one country and particularly perhaps in the so-called nuclear countries that is increasingly apprehensive lest a nuclear holocaust might well be caused not by belligerent action so much as by sheer accident <e> <s> in that case are her majestys government satisfied that some kind of register of accidents small and large in all nuclear countries is being kept and that the knowledge and skill in dealing with accidents as such is being freely and frankly exchanged among such countries because that procedure based as it would be on practical co-operation and mutual interest would be one way of approaching the intensely difficult task of effectively achieving multilateral nuclear disarmament <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to return to one aspect of this extremely important exchange <e> <s> while no one would wish to create undue alarm regarding this question it is however a fact that there has been widespread apprehension regarding the possibility of accident rather than war leading to literally a holocaust <e> <s> in this connection will the minister possibly in consultation with the foreign office look into the findings so far promulgated by infce in which we are taking a very prominent and <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mcnair has indeed raised a question of the utmost gravity to the palestinian refugees who now number a million and three-quarters and especially to the children and the fact is that unless action is taken very soon by april or at the latest may of this year to provide the necessary funds elementary and secondary schools will close and a third of a million children of school age and nearly school teachers all of them refugees by the way will be at large adding to the peculiar stresses and bitternesses which already afflict the refugee communities in the five main areas between the lebanon and the gaza strip <e> <s> that is the human problem as the noble lord lord mcnair so graphically described it <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case if in fact towards a smaller financial crisis last year there were special contributions of million dollars i suggest that it might be well for the arab world to consider making at least the same amount available immediately for in respect of a far greater and more imminent crisis affecting these groups <e>", "<cs> my lords may i very warmly welcome the forthright and clear statements made by the foreign secretary on this matter and strongly support the suggestion made by my noble friend <e> <s> we agree that the best way to move forward without losing the momentum which the foreign secretary foremost among others secured for us in this matter towards the end of last year would be to reconvene the five and other countries and to consult them with a view to reconvening the conference as soon as possible under united nations auspices on the basis that the unilateral and singular recognition of swapo as the only negotiating body would be dropped in favour of a more comprehensive basis for negotiation <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add my own congratulations to those of my noble friend to the noble lord and hope that he will continue for <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the house for intervening once more but this is very important <e> <s> may we take it that the madrid initiative is more or less confined to confidence-building measures while the extant discussions which are continuing in geneva in vienna and in the disarmament commission in new york cover a much wider field <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may raise a separate point may we take it that in addition to the courses to which the noble lord has referred it is the practice of departments and particularly a department like the foreign office to provide special courses in other public institutions such as universities and particularly polytechnics where applied language studies can he given <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the lord president aware that the information and the statistics which he has given will reassure those of us they are not very many who have the impression that these courses are a kind of holiday <e> <s> in fact they cater for learners and they are applied very seriously to the requirements of a wide-ranging field of public service <e>", "<cs> my lords are her majestys government aware that there would be widespread support for the views expressed by the noble baroness lady vickers on this rather difficult and dangerous point that in particular there would be general support for any attempts by the united kingdom to resolve the difficulties in the area relating mostly to frontiers and also to ensure the viability and the security of the area whatever constitutional forms are decided <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will have listened with pleasure and respect to the noble lord lord bethell for the temperate and balanced way in which he treated a very difficult and possibly dangerous question <e> <s> his motion divides itself naturally into two parts as he will agree british-spanish relations a very important aspect of what we are discussing and as he reminded us the question of gibraltar <e> <s> both are related unfortunately and i shall first address myself to a few observations on british-spanish <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should not say that <e> <s> i believe that it is the way of the future and i believe that my own race the welsh have shown that this can be done always outnumbered never out-manoeuvred <e> <s> throughout our history we have striven to face the facts to make our contribution to insist upon our distinctive personality and at the same time to be an essential part of the british unity at least from the times of the tudors onwards <e> <s> my noble friend who had the good sense to marry a welsh wife can hardly disagree with that <e>", "<cs> i did my lords <e>", "<cs> i was <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister care to remind the house that some years ago this country drafted a perfectly practical plan for the banning of chemical and allied weapons which was generally received as a very feasible proposal by the then members of the old disarmament committee in geneva <e> <s> would he confirm that that draft is now with the soviet union and the united states governments who have still to report upon its feasibility <e> <s> would he help to speed up the delivery of their comments to the present disarmament commission in geneva which would seem to most of us to be the quickest way of implementing what is already proven to be a perfectly practical plan for the banning of chemical weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords with the indulgence of the house may i ask the minister to confirm as a good augury for the proposals relating to chemical warfare that the biological warfare test ban convention has been acceded to ratified i believe by the vast majority of the members of the united nations and seems to be observed in practice by them <e> <s> that is a very good augury for the success of the chemical warfare negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords it certainly would be no part of my intention in my brief intervention to criticise in any way the performance and the policy of tate and lyle <e> <s> we all know that the noble earl who holds a position of high distinction and great respect in this house is more concerned and more saddened than anybody by the possibility of the closure of the liverpool refinery <e>", "<cs> my lords in very precise and generous terms the noble earl has given one part of the undertaking for which we have asked namely so far as her majestys government can achieve this the european community is going to honour its obligation to the acp countries <e> <s> lom is going to be upheld and we are very grateful to him for being so <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the final sentence of his original answer to my noble friend a sentence which he deliberately repeated quite rightly will be carefully studied on this side of the house officially with a view to ascertaining perhaps later on that it is not part of the governments policy of the immediate future to spread these very dangerous weapons in every part of the country that the to miles limitation will be applied as long and as meticulously as possible and that the possibility of the missiles being sited in additionally hazardous areas as my noble friend has described northern ireland will only be taken into consideration in exigency which would mean of course the direst possible exigency of all <e>", "<cs> my lords the brevity of the speeches we have listened to makes one feel that the arrangements for the discussion of such an important matter need to be looked at in the future <e> <s> i think that it would be generally agreed in all parts of the house that the debate would have been improved by allowing certainly the mover and a number of others to deploy in their speeches some of these points in much greater detail than they felt they could <e> <s> we are very indebted to the noble lord lord alexander of potterhill for making it possible for us to discuss this important matter even for such a short time <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that serious as the question of el salvador is it is part of a much larger issue affecting the stability of central america including the caribbeans <e> <s> can he assure us that when our prime minister meets the american president to discuss international affairs as well as monetary affairs a very high priority will be given to this area a term which in his last answer he deliberately used <e> <s> both this country and the united states hopefully with the co-operation of the soviet union must do what they can to maintain and ensure stability in central america and the caribbeans <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl rightly reminded the house that this government <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that in the short sharp and very informed debate that we had on this matter the other day we all agreed that her majestys government were doing quite well in this matter and indeed had increased their contribution to this year over last year <e> <s> does he further recall that information was given to the house at least from this side that very many if not most of our partners in the eec were falling short of last years performance rather than improving upon it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm once more that our understanding with china in regard to hong kong is part of the undoubtedly excellent relations that we now enjoy with the peoples republic of china and that however informal that understanding may be it has proved workable and augurs well for the future which both previous supplementary questions have raised <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that this is essentially an attempt to strengthen <e>", "<cs> my lords with the indulgence of the house may i press the point made by my noble friend about the need to continue to involve the united states in these discussions <e> <s> as they are related to the csce to which the united states is an important party may we hope that the government will ensure that the new administration in washington takes a full part in these discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords while appreciating the particular difficulty which persists in a former condominium dependency like the new hebrides and also appreciating that the british government are proceeding with their own part of the aid programme will the minister accept that in all parts of the house there is concern that the new government of the new hebrides which inherits quite exceptional difficulties arising from the circumstances described by my noble friend should receive every possible help it can get <e> <s> when he refers to our not being in consultation and co-operation with the australian government at this stage a statement i quite understand may i take it that he will however keep very much in mind that it is essential that the australian government be drawn into this matter as soon as ever possible <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl say what the status of our diplomatic representation is in albania at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there is considerable concern in the commonwealth and in the third world which is not necessarily included in the commonwealth about the great disparity in fees between those charged to commonwealth students and those charged to students from europe or indeed from very poor countries in the third world <e> <s> is not this grossly unfair and also very shortsighted in view of the fact that the more commonwealth students we train and influence in this country the better is the reception to both our commerce and our diplomacy in their home countries <e>", "<cs> my lords is the term overseas countries deemed to include europe <e> <s> because commonwealth students pay substantially more than students from europe do for the same tuition <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble lord lord byers for the constructive and balanced speech with which he has opened this debate <e> <s> the middle east is indeed a vast area of instability and a constant threat to its own peace and the peace of the world and in recent years the factors of instability have increased instead of diminishing <e> <s> in the islamic revolution we have a new accession of muslim consciousness and power much of it understandable but some of it as in iran capable of unleashing new and disturbing forces <e> <s> the soviet invasion and occupation of afghanistan is related to all this and has given an added dimension of instability in the area <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that these figures will be very carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl believe that the conclusion of an equitable fisheries rgime with our neighbours in the european community would go a long way indeed towards solving the problems of the british fishing industry if it did not solve them all <e> <s> is he aware that it is good news that this committee has been formed and even better news that it is moving so swiftly <e> <s> can it look at the general question of quotas and subsidies as part of its deliberations <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister however look at that answer again in the light of what the noble earl has suggested to him <e> <s> the dispute with the argentine might very well be more quickly solved if there were between us and the argentine or better still between the community and the argentine a get-together under the aegis of this decision of the council of ministers to see what can be done not only in but around the falkland islands in view of the undisputed fact that very valuable hydro-carbon deposits and also sea food are apparently in plenitude in that area <e>", "<cs> my lords with the indulgence of the house may i press this point <e> <s> while the question of the sovereignty of the islands is not a matter of dispute within this country or in the falkland islands nevertheless one of the two working parties which are now negotiating ways and means of cooperation between the falklands and the argentine should surely be looking into the possibilities mentioned by the noble earl lord lauderdale among which are the distinct possibilities of very big finds in hydro-carbon oils and also an extensive area of sea food in that general maritime region <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all very grateful to my noble friend lord brockway for raising this question <e> <s> this is a matter not only of importance to the wellbeing of the people of hong kong but also of far-reaching importance to the relations between this country and the peoples republic of china and therefore to the whole balance of future relations between the west and china <e> <s> so whatever we say or do about hong kong has an impact beyond the crown colony itself <e> <s> i am bound to say that while i sympathise very strongly as i always do with my noble friends passionate convictions about the need to improve the lot of the people in our few remaining dependencies frankly in what he said i did not recognise a complete and true picture of what hong kong is like today <e> <s> i was the minister responsible for our relations with china and with hong kong and as my noble friend lord rhodes who has worked so hard and contributed so much to anglo-chinese understanding will readily agree it is impossible to talk about hong kong without weighing very carefully the facts the figures and the reality of what has been done in hong kong what is being done in hong kong and what needs to be done in hong kong <e>", "<cs> my lords i know the results of those and so i believe does the present foreign secretary <e> <s> we owe a great deal of gratitude to my noble friend lord rhodes for the practical efforts he has made to sustain this precious understanding between us and the vast and potentially powerful peoples republic of china <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord for his statement may i first of all express pleasure at the friendly reception which he and the prime minister received in washington <e> <s> the special relationship and i for one am never chary of using the term does in fact exist whether or not everybody approves of it <e> <s> however it should never be the relationship of siamese twins each tied indissolubly to the objectives of the other <e> <s> unfortunately over the weekend many of us have had the impression that there has been a rather hasty inadequately thought-out british over-commitment to certain exaggerated american objectives <e> <s> i hope i am quite wrong about this as i speak as one who firmly believes in the special relationship within nato <e> <s> the statement however does tone down the fairly authoritative reports we have had over the weekend and i welcome the tone of the statement to that extent <e>", "<cs> my lords before the committee resumes i am sure the house will allow me to thank the noble lord for the great care he has taken in dealing with the points raised by my noble friends and myself and others on this important statement and also to congratulate him on the efficacy of his efforts <e> <s> he has clarified a number of points that troubled members in all parts of the house and no doubt in all parts of the country and possibly throughout the west <e> <s> in particular we welcome his reassurance that the rapid deployment force is not something meant for the gulf only <e> <s> the impression has been created unfairly and unjustifiably perhaps but it is there as we heard this morning that it is something for the gulf <e> <s> the reaction from our arab friends and among them some of the true friends of israel has been instant and hostile <e> <s> what the noble lord had to say on the rdf will be particularly welcome in many quarters of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister take note that as the last supplementary question from the noble lord lord brockway indicated there is very strong support on this side for the points raised by the noble baroness lady vickers and particularly as regards her inquiry about the extent of the suffering indeed the terminal suffering as i understand her to say arising from famine and related diseases in very many districts in each of these four countries <e> <s> there is evidence that the situation is getting worse <e> <s> may i therefore put this question july is some time away and may result only in discussion and possible resolutions <e> <s> will the noble lord therefore in the meantime press upon the administrator who is in turn supported by the secretary generals special committee for this purpose the need to co-ordinate and act even more effectively than has been done so far in anticipation of any decisions which may be arrived at by the july meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords with the indulgence of the house may i intervene once more <e> <s> we should be careful to press upon the economic and social council the need to go forward with the essential long-term policies mentioned by the noble baroness while at the same time seeing to it that in the interim the essentially emergency nature of the disaster in these four countries is attended to with <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming what the minister has said about improving these services in the three countries he named particularly if i may say so the increased broadcasting to turkey at the present time may i ask him whether it is not also the fact that during the same period some very heavy cuts have been made in other parts of the world <e> <s> would he not agree that any further investment in this excellent service can only strengthen our diplomacy improve our commerce and generally strengthen the influence of britain in the world as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords while appreciating very much the spirit and tone of the noble lords replies to these questions may i ask a factual question <e> <s> how is a junior minister defined <e> <s> are they all ministers below secretary of state level <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble lord the foreign secretary for that statement <e> <s> it is an encouraging one and i am glad to congratulate him on a very substantial achievement <e> <s> for more than a century relations between us and guatemala have been unduly difficult because of certain claims they have sustained against belize which was under our protection <e> <s> what we have of course is a number of heads of agreement and there may be some tough argument as to their implementation <e> <s> but it is particularly pleasing that the governments of both belize and guatemala have accepted the heads of agreement and judging from the foreign secretarys statement today are well on the way to agreeing on the details which are as he said mutually beneficial to the two countries <e> <s> it is certainly in their best interests to agree as soon as possible because a settlement will help to maintain the peace and stability of that crucial area especially in the face of cuban adventurism <e> <s> it is in the interests of central america as a whole that there should be this new evidence of stability in that area <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that a more rapid advance to the total abolition of <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that there might be fairly general support for any moves that the government found feasible to strengthen our diplomatic representation in madagascar and generally in that part of the world in view of the strategic importance of madagascar and its potentially great economic and commercial importance to this country <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that the successful outcome of the negotiations which resulted in the settlement in rhodesia provides a very hopeful precedent for the way in which the united nations and we in the west and everybody else concerned can deal with the namibian situation <e> <s> will he in particular remind his right honourable and noble friend the foreign secretary that one of the major features of the lancaster house negotiations was that everybody concerned in the future of rhodesia within rhodesia and in countries contiguous to rhodesia were consulted and took part in fashioning the very effective settlement <e> <s> in which case it would seem very helpful for her majestys government to speak firmly in pretoria and with clarity in washington <e>", "<cs> my lords apart from the meeting in august which post-dates the meeting in june may i ask the minister to convey to his right honourable friend the feeling on both sides of the house that between now and june if june is in evitably the date of this conference there should be very close consultation with other participants in that meeting particularly with the united states of america whose presence and whose participation in such a <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord the foreign secretary for this statement <e> <s> we find the paragraph on unemployment particularly among young people vague and disappointing <e> <s> apparently no progress has been made since the last summit in fashioning new and effective policies to deal with this scourge which is afflicting all member states of the community <e> <s> this is most disquieting as some members of the community more than others have reason to remember what mass unemployment especially among young people led to in central europe in the late s <e>", "<cs> my lords the hour is late but this is a very important matter and i hope not to detain your lordships for more than a few minutes <e> <s> however we are grateful to my noble friend lord hatch of lusby for the comprehensive speech that he has made about central and southern africa <e> <s> he has very considerable first-hand knowledge of this vast area and i am sure the minister has listened with close attention to what he said <e> <s> there were many important points some of them disquieting which he so graphically put to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lady white deserves our gratitude for a speech which combined her warm sympathy for human rights and the quite admirable clarity with which she dealt with the complex issues which are the subject of this very important but rather difficult report <e> <s> i think her speech effectively expressed the views of most of us at least at this stage in the continuing public discussion which i believe the government like the opposition quite rightly expect to go on for quite a time before the issue is finally decided <e> <s> i would certainly join with my noble friend in thanking the sub-committee for the care with which they considered these matters assembling valuable testimony and stating a number of balanced conclusions <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put two queries to the minister <e> <s> first will he consider issuing when the conference is over a statement including verbatim reports of the speeches made by the leading delegates and identical to or similar to the statements in the white paper which we issued in after the belgrade conference <e> <s> i leave that query for the noble lord to go into <e> <s> secondly on the question of disarmament and the french proposal is the noble lord aware that there is a very firmly-held opinion and it is i think a bipartisan opinion that any advance on the french proposal while welcome in itself should not prejudice whatever success awaits us in vienna and geneva and certainly not in the salt talks which everybody hopes will be resumed as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming the ministers assurance that parliament will be consulted will he consider putting in the library of this house and possibly the other place a facsimile he need not produce the whole passport of what is proposed so that we can judge the rubric and the contents as well as the relationship of the eec to the extra-british nationals who will be using our passport <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the importance of nigeria and its immense potential especially in africa both diplomatically and commercially would the minister assure the house that the closest possible consultation will be maintained between us and nigeria in the future especially in regard to the future of namibia so vital to the future of the west and western industry and in regard to the expediting of the end of apartheid in southern africa <e>", "<cs> my lords may we then take it that the bulk of the million pledged by various countries at this conference will be devoted to capital developments in zimbabwe but that the question of extra aid to contiguous countries arising from their difficulties with food supply will be looked at with a view to enabling them to take from zimbabwe the very heavy surplus of maize among other things which it is already producing <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister indicate now or later what percentage of the gnp of this country has been devoted to overseas aid in the three years indicated in the question of my noble friend and indicate also how far short in each year we have been of the united nations target of per cent <e> <s> of gnp <e> <s> moreover will he confirm or not that in those three years between and we have fallen behind our competitors in europe and elsewhere in the amount of aid we extend overseas with the result that compared with them we are suffering diplomatically and commercially in those countries <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister gave an interesting answer to my former supplementary but it was a rather adroit misleading one if i may say so in all friendship when he compared our performance in this field with that of eastern europe <e> <s> would he now compare it with our friends and partners in western europe <e> <s> they are very much more our commercial competitors in the countries of aid than we are competitors with the eastern european countries <e>", "<cs> my lords will consideration be given to the possibility of circularising the leas with a view to their recognising the increasing importance of the third world <e> <s> so that each lea looks at the possibility of an across-the-board inclusion of significant instruction on the third world in its present <e>", "<cs> but my lords surely the minister will confirm especially in view of the repeated attempts of the swedish government for instance through sipri and other organisations to instigate such a study and like the minister i emphasise the word study that a vote in favour of a study would have had a very marked effect upon public opinion and indeed on opinion in the united nations <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister pay particular attention to what my noble friend lord shinwell has said with the very great experience and authority that there is behind it namely that among other things a study of this kind will smoke out those countries which make lavish disarmament proposals simply as a smoke screen for something else <e>", "<cs> my lords while appreciating the difficulties and the possible disadvantages of making public from time to time the workings of technical sub-committees would not the spirit of the question of my noble friend lord brockway be implemented if her majestys government and like-minded governments who are members of the disarmament commission in new york were to consider gathering together the results of all the meetings in vienna and in geneva and publishing them through the agency of the com <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will be very grateful to the noble lord lord chitnis for raising this question <e> <s> our first concern must be for the people of el salvador itself <e> <s> they are the <e>", "<cs> my lords this is all very interesting but where is this money in good solid cash going to <e> <s> is it going into the treasury of the

warmth is not one of the lord presidents characteristics <e> <s> perhaps on occasions there is a surplus of heat but that is not characteristic either <e> <s> in the spirit of a number of the contributions made on both sides of the house i repeat on both sides of the house may i ask the lord president whether he would consider this morning sending a message to the unified civil service organisations saying i am ready to see you today <e> <s> there are people who are worrying about movement over easter not just holiday movement but movements for purposes of health consultation and so on <e> <s> people have got on to some of us about these arrangements <e> <s> there is great <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming the tone and substance of the foreign secretarys reply to my noble friend in that it means that we shall continue as a country to support all meaningful attempts to secure arms control in this field in a most comprehensive sense both inside nato and outside in other fora may i express pleasure at seeing him back in this country and looking so well <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that while there may be varying views as to the nature of the so-called guarantee to which this government were one party in its real contribution would be to strengthening the support of the united nations for the present intercommunal talks <e> <s> without the success of these talks however slow they may be developing there can be no settlement in cyprus <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lords question is very much to the point these days however much some of us might disagree with the exact phrasing of what he says in so far as the evenhanded approach to the rights of the israelis and the legitimate aspirations of the palestinians is indirectly mentioned in resolution is it not a fact that resolution i think passed about a year after the passage of to a very large extent covers the point raised by the noble lord lord chelwood <e>", "<cs> my lords may i lend my support to the suggestion made in the noble lords question <e> <s> would the minister confirm that it is not necessary for the government of a country to have recourse to application to the security council under article <e> <s> indeed very important and effective initiatives have in the past been taken by the security council without there being an application from the government concerned to the security council <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister like to take this opportunity of assuring the house that the continuing action which everybody deplores whatever may be the reason for it is not holding up payments in cash to beneficiaries many of whom depend from week to week on prompt payments of their benefits <e> <s> secondly will he also assure the house that the security of the country is in no way being jeopardised <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister will take this opportunity of confirming that the promotion of arms sales in any country continues to be subject to a proper evaluation of the effect of such a transfer of arms on the political situation in that part of the world <e> <s> one has very much in mind the situation in the middle east where an even-handed political approach and therefore of sale of arms is essential to the continuing if precarious stability of that area <e>", "<cs> my lords how much of what and to which side <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add to that that we on this side of the table wish the foreign secretary well in continuing to secure a solution of this difficult problem which affects the area as well as the countries concerned <e> <s> may i make the suggestion which no doubt he has considered very carefully that the best way to allay any fears as to the future and the independence of belize would be somehow to negotiate <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be very grateful to the noble lord lord skelmersdale for the lucid and very informative way in which he introduced this order which i hasten to assert from this side of the house meets with our enthusiastic approval <e> <s> i gather that the other place stole a march on us this morning but there was not time for either the noble lord or i to find out what they have made of the order <e> <s> i doubt if any difficulty arose during their discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords for the purposes of this question can the noble lord define the region mentioned in the question and in particular what state or states would according to that definition be contiguous to the union of soviet socialist republics <e> <s> would it involve more than one particular state <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to reinforce what the minister has just said while very fully sympathising with what the noble lord lord avebury has said that the gleneagles agreements like other agreements that led up to them were very difficult to attain were between governments and implicity and explicitly placed upon governments the onus and the opportunity of exerting the best and most efficient possible pressure on their nationals in this direction <e> <s> any suggestion of pillorying individuals for any decision of their own for which governments are not responsible would be greatly resented by very many of us <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that the advance which has been made is that the five-power initiative which has been going on for about months is now comparatively speaking receiving american support <e> <s> will her majestys government very carefully nurture this support <e> <s> because without it even the best efforts of the european powers may prove fruitless <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is indeed grateful to my noble friend lord greenhill of harrow for presenting his committees report and for doing so in such an admirable fashion <e> <s> the house also appreciates the very thoughtful speech that the noble lord lord carrington has made in this context <e> <s> he picked up a number of very important points which i am bound to say struck some very favourable echoes from this side of the house and i think it will be fair to assume from the liberal benches as well <e> <s> it is a report in the very best traditions of the house and it will be a definitive document on aid for many years to come particularly as the needs and the implications of the grants revelations are properly tackled <e>", "<cs> my lords while entirely in accord with the purport of the question of my noble friend lord shinwell and if i may say so gratified to understand that the dmarche to the soviet ambassador on th march has been followed up at diplomatic level in moscow since may i press the minister to assure the house that any further incursions which may or may not be considered by the soviet union or any other country will be regarded by the rest of us and that means not only this country but also the community and indeed the united nations with the utmost disapproval leading possibly to action to mark that disapproval <e> <s> in particular will the noble lord give an indication that above all the integrity of poland will continue to be respected physically by the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords while strongly agreeing with my noble friend lord brockway that the need for international action to defuse if not to solve the situation in the middle east is now of acute urgency may i put the following points to her majestys government in preparation for tomorrows meeting of the security council <e> <s> first are consultations being held with other member countries of the security council with a view to united and significant action by the security council or by the appropriate agency of the united nations organisation <e> <s> if so do those consultations include not only our friends and allies whom i hope are naturally being constantly consulted in these flatters but also the soviet union and china <e> <s> thirdly in view of the conflicting reports as to the purpose and the capability of the iraqi bagdad installation ranging from what prime minister begin has had to say about its being a matter of a few weeks in which atomic bombs might be produced and used from this base to create another holocaust in israel to rejections of such a view within israel itself by certain leaders and also reports of new information may i ask her majestys government whether they themselves or with other countries concerned will initiate a swift review of the workings of the inspectorial i may say the review will be swifter still if i am not interrupted <e>", "<cs> the inspectorial functions of the international atomic energy agency especially in regard to the implementation of the nonproliferation treaty <e> <s> these are very important questions which ought to be discussed tomorrow in the security council <e>"]
