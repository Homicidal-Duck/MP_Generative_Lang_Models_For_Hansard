["<cs> my lords if the minister did not hear the report on the radio this morning perhaps by chance he saw the very circumstantial and detailed report by a reputable correspondent in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble earl for the care he takes in answering this question which concerns members on both sides of the house <e> <s> could he tell us whether the new tender system will result in a lower subsidy on the price to for instance russia than the old system which amounted to a subsidy of p per pound a subsidy which would be most acceptable to the british housewife <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord lord carrington for so promptly coming to the house to make that very important statement may i ask whether he is aware that we would all wish to congratulate mr robert mugabe on his electoral victory and wish him well in the immense tasks that face him and his people in the future in particular the task of reuniting a country which has only recently emerged from a long period of destruction and bloodshed and that of building a true democracy a free society and a prosperous economy <e> <s> does the noble lord further agree that it is the wish of the government of the united kingdom and of all sections of the people of the united kingdom to establish from the very start of the emergence of the new state of zimbabwe relations of strong friendship and wide-ranging co-operation as rhodesia emerges as the sovereign independent state of zimbabwe and we hope a member of the commonwealth <e>", "<cs> my lords with the indulgence of the house may i intervene very briefly to make two points <e> <s> i would very much like to add to what i said earlier in my personal appreciation of the role played by the foreign and commonwealth secretary <e> <s> it is so obvious that perhaps i missed him in the list of people i mentioned as deserving our appreciation <e> <s> i join with him of course in the view that the time for congratulation is at the outcome of these events <e> <s> if congratulation is for the future surely appreciation may be tolerated for the interim <e> <s> as i have said previously in the house <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put two points to the noble lord <e> <s> did i hear him aright to say that even if the russians were to withdraw from afghanistan we would still not be advising or allowing our sportsmen to go to moscow <e> <s> if that is what is said it would seem to me to be an imbalance of assessment <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord would clarify that point <e> <s> the second point is this <e> <s> the noble lord said that our government are advising our sportsmen against going to moscow <e> <s> does that advice apply to the british media particularly the television medium <e>", "<cs> my lords my second point was this will the government give the same advice to the british media particularly the television medium about going to moscow as they are now giving to our sportsmen <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that our practice in this matter stems fundamentally from our accession to the various geneva agreements which bind a large number of countriesand secondly from the obligations we incur like other signatories when we accede to protocols to agreements in regard to specific international arrangements <e> <s> further will he confirm my impression i think it is fairly well-founded but i should like it confirmed that this country accords this type of privilege and immunity very much to the same extent and to the same numbers of personnel as comparable countries like for example the republic of france and western germany do <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to my noble friend lady white for the admirable way in which she initiated this useful and timely debate <e> <s> we also are very well aware of the fact that although she has not been in the chair of the select committee for a very long time she has already given ample evidence of her great capabilities <e> <s> todays speech like its predecessor was an example of what i mean <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has quoted what was on the tip of my tongue to quote but one does not want to put one organisation against another <e> <s> however it is perfectly true <e> <s> many members in the middle echelons of the commission i am sure because i know a few who have said this to me point to that example <e> <s> it works extremely well <e> <s> those of us who deal with documentation either in government or in opposition know that it works <e> <s> indeed with a few more languages i believe four the united nations organisation has shown that it can get along with fewer than nine <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords will all this get us anywhere <e> <s> do we go on having these injunctions these judgments with nothing at all in effect happening <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that his remarks about hong kong and the extraordinary efforts which the governor the government and the people of hong kong have made to help in this appallingly difficult problem would be greatly appreciated in the colony <e> <s> we on this side of the house would like to associate ourselves very markedly with what he and the noble earl have said about the contribution of hong kong to at least a partial amelioration of this immense human tragedy in this part of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords much as we enjoy the ministers flippancies on these occasions is he aware that many of us feel that the noble viscount lord massereene and ferrard has raised a matter of some importance <e> <s> may i ask whether the minister would look at this matter in the light of the fact that there arc still some crafts in this country which are unique in a world connection and are uniquely british <e> <s> is he aware that it would be a great pity if through the rather arbitrary operation of a flat rate vat certain very precious very valuable and quite unique crafts which are equally arts were gradually to be lost by this country <e>"]
