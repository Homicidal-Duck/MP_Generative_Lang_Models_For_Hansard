["<cs> my lords will the noble viscount take into consideration the effect upon regional aid arising from our membership of the eec <e> <s> noble lords on this side of the chamber fought hard in the european parliament for our fair share of regional aid from the eec and one of the chairmen a member of another place was congratulated on the amount of money which came to the united kingdom from the regional fund <e> <s> may i remind the noble viscount that italy and the united kingdom are the greatest beneficiaries from the regional fund of the eec <e> <s> but so far as i understand it the money spent on regional aid by the eec has to be matched by the member states governments <e> <s> does it mean that if her majestys government decide to cut back on regional aid it will mean a lessening of the amount which we shall get from the eec regional fund <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise that the government are committed to equality between the sexes although that might not go down very well with the noble lord lord barnby <e> <s> perhaps he does not even believe in equality between the sexes <e> <s> will the government consider changing the legislation because that is what will be necessary not changing the rules so that the right of british men born overseas to marry and to settle in britain with foreign wives is taken away from british men <e> <s> i ask this question bearing in mind the equality between the sexes which the government are supposed to support <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also join with other noble members in congratulating the noble earl lord erne on his maiden speech this afternoon <e> <s> he outlined to us that the problems are not just of the capital city of england but are also of the rural areas in what one would call the far flung parts of britain <e> <s> i want to pay special congratulations to the noble baroness lady ryder of warsaw to whom one listened with great interest while admiring all the work that she has done for so many years for those less fortunate <e> <s> the work that she enumerated this afternoon is particularly touching to me because it was this time last year that i lost my husband through that perhaps one should say dreadful disease <e> <s> i hope we shall hear them both speak often in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister in view of the eecs concern and the european parliaments concern about worker participation in the european community especially as it seems to be successful in many of the countries of our partners in the eec why the government find it so difficult to operate it in this country hearing in mind that germany and france and many of our european partners find it a suitable vehicle <e> <s> might it not be that because they find it a much more suitable vehicle they get greater worker participation and fewer strikes arising in those industries <e>", "<cs> my lords what the noble earl has just said might be very welcome news for the farmers who are a minority of the people in great britain <e> <s> however one would accept that the consumers in great britain and they in the main are the housewives comprise the majority <e> <s> as regards mention of of per cent <e> <s> the noble earl gave us some idea of the increase in the price of butter that was foreseen in the near future <e> <s> the price of butter is a bone of contention as the noble earl clearly understands in view of the amount of butter which is held in intervention by the eec <e> <s> so while the british housewife might feel that the farmers are doing very well out of it she will be quite concerned that once again in spite of all the butter that is held in intervention she will have to pay i think the noble earl said another p on a pound which in view of all the other increases in gas electricity and so on might become the last straw <e> <s> the noble earl gave the figure for butter <e> <s> can he this afternoon give figures for any other increases that he expects the consumer the housewife will have to bear in this kind of devaluation of the green pound which will no doubt be of help to the farmer but will be of detriment to the consumer <e> <s> can he give us the increases in any other prices besides that of butter <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to raise one further point <e> <s> how does the noble earl interpret one-third of p on the price of a loaf in terms of retail figures <e>", "<cs> as somebody from birmingham i can say <e>", "<cs> i wish to add my voice in support of the amendment and particularly the part <e>", "<cs> i was interested in what the minister said <e> <s> she had until a few minutes ago been using the word choice but changed it in her last reply to preference <e> <s> indeed that is all that the clause is saying it is saying preference <e> <s> i might prefer a mink coat hut i know very well that my choice will have to be rabbit or some imitation fur <e> <s> for parents to show a preference might sound all right but it does not alter the situation as it is at present <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord consider publishing figures in exactly the same way as figures are being published of so-called scroungers on social security <e> <s> the noble lord talked about a percentage and if the figures were published the general public would know that there is not one law for the rich and one law for the poor <e>", "<cs> surely it would he far easier for the government to index according to wage levels <e> <s> we constantly read in the media about average weekly earnings and those figures obviously are collated monthly <e> <s> i believe that we require some assurance from the minister because if at some stage the government think of changing the cost of living index the resulting scheme <e>", "<cs> it was interesting to listen to the noble baroness liken the situation to the television farce yes minister <e> <s> it might be a matter which makes us smile in this building but for those people outside who watch that television programme yes minister it is a farce and when those people in the public gallery see it being acted realistically in a legislature i think that it will make them think what is government all about <e>", "<cs> my lords after the previous speaker my comments are not perhaps going to be so clever <e> <s> nor shall i speak with the same experience because i do not have the engineering qualifications of the previous speaker <e> <s> however i can speak as a traveller and an extensive traveller at that on public transport <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend <e> <s> i thought he was admiring my good looks <e>", "<cs> my lords i was interested when the noble lord introducing the bill said that of course the market knows best <e> <s> well of course the government recognise the argument for a relaxed bus licensing system <e> <s> when they say it will lead to dramatic improvements that is really based upon a hypothetical basis <e> <s> i do not criticise them for trying <e> <s> but i remember that when i entered politics a very long time ago a worthy colleague of mine on the birmingham city council who came from lancashire said dont forget when you are discussing people that theres nowt so strange as folk <e>", "<cs> well my lords it did not say anything about being expensive <e> <s> if you have a car i suppose you have to pay to park it <e> <s> but the article said it was because of lack of use <e> <s> i think it is as cheap to park your car as to waste petrol coming in or miles through london <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the noble lord for that reply and i fully appreciate that the committee has been deliberating for quite some time regarding the household duties test may i conclude from his remarks that after receiving that report he might then take into consideration that which the eec directive says as to the periodical examination of these kinds of disadvantage to women <e> <s> can we have an assurance from the noble lord that on receipt of the report on household duties he may perhaps more sympathetically consider a periodic examination of this pension <e> <s> i listened to what the noble lord said about the cost but one would have thought that that would not increase but would be a decreasing cost to the government <e>", "<cs> my lords with the permission of the house may i ask for an answer to my particular question about a periodic review as is required under the eec directive <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to have interrupted the noble lord <e> <s> i was not really following his remarks on cohabitation and all that <e> <s> i could not see the argument he was putting forward until he came to the last sentence <e> <s> i apologise for getting up too quickly <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for a very long and detailed reply which was rather complicated <e> <s> i often wonder whether the beneficiaries who make these claims understand how complicated they are <e> <s> they are most complicated for us who try to understand them never mind the people who have to make claims <e> <s> but i thank the noble baroness for her remarks and one looks forward to the fulfilment of the equal opportunities directive of the eec <e> <s> i accept her reply and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble baroness for her very generous reply <e> <s> i wonder whether she would write to me regarding the position of the one parent family woman who is not cohabiting not living with anybody but who might fall into this category <e> <s> i am not now asking the noble baroness to define a caring person <e> <s> would it be somebody who was helping a one parent family woman who was trying to work and keep her child herself and not rely upon social security benefits thus justifying her in making a claim <e> <s> may i ask the noble baroness to write to me about that <e> <s> i am a little disturbed that the regulations that are before us this afternoon are subject to the negative resolution procedure <e> <s> sex discrimination should be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure so that we can all see the progress made in regard to discrimination <e> <s> very often it is on the fine details of the regulations that discrimination creeps in <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> it is important to mention that this affects not only rural areas but also urban areas where public money is being used to subsidise certain bus services because the local authorities think that those services are good for the public <e>", "<cs> the local government act placed clear duties on the county council to promote the provision of a co-ordinated and efficient system of public transport to meet the needs of the county <e> <s> as therefore they must provide a co-ordinated and efficient system this provision is necessary <e> <s> further under the transport act the metropolitan county council was given the duty of developing policies which would promote the provision of a coordinated and efficient system to meet the countys needs <e> <s> for those reasons we should include a clear provision in the bill so that those necessary needs as outlined in the and acts can clearly he put into operation with the representations as outlined in the amendment able to be put <e> <s> i therefore hope the government will consider the needs of the public services in this regard <e>", "<cs> as somebody who served for years on <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his reply and i shall read his observations in <e>", "<cs> i apologise most sincerely to the noble lord <e> <s> perhaps what he said was not so clear because of bad acoustics <e> <s> all these children are individual and separate <e> <s> they cannot be defined exactly i think that this is what the minister was saying and that causes a problem <e> <s> they are all individual and are all different but some of the differences are only slight and this must be accepted as it is accepted in any school where one child may be rather backward while another is a little brighter <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord give the house some information regarding the uptake of the vaccine among school-girls <e> <s> i know that the department was hoping for a per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> uptake <e> <s> are we anywhere near those targets <e>", "<cs> i rise to support my noble friend on the front bench regarding houses for sale in certain areas <e> <s> i give you some up-to-date figures from warrington new town development corporation <e> <s> there they are trying hard to sell their houses <e> <s> i am a member of that authority and i know that nothing is being held back but at the present moment their figures are very low <e> <s> in fact no purpose built rented dwellings which have been completed by the warrington new town development corporation have been sold but we have sold some of the houses the development corporation purchased from private builders <e> <s> these were houses that were purchased from private builders because the previous government said that more houses had to be rented by the authority than put up for sale <e> <s> our figures are very small indeed and hear out what my noble friend said <e> <s> these were houses originally built for sale by a large contractor which warrington development corporation bought up <e> <s> they are the only houses at the present moment that have been sold by that development corporation <e>", "<cs> i shall be quite brief <e> <s> i understand that what the schedule is saying is that we will accept warden service housing and nothing else <e> <s> if my interpretation is wrong then perhaps i shall be told about that afterwards <e> <s> what i want to say is that if you can act humanely and place somebody who is elderly in a bungalow which has some adaptations whether it is special bath rails dimmer lights ramps or whatever then that commends itself to all of us <e> <s> but if you want to look at this financially you have to say that it is much cheaper for the social services and therefore the local authority to provide meals on wheels and home helps than it is to place someone in an elderly persons home <e> <s> it is better for the person concerned as well as being cheaper if you want to look at it from the economic point of view <e>", "<cs> i think this is an admirable clause but it is nothing new as the noble lord will understand <e> <s> for many years now years or more many large local authorities have given added points to people who are in the armed forces so that they come to the top of the queue when they give up their serving time <e> <s> this is really a continuation of what perhaps good local authorities have been doing on the letting side <e> <s> now it is on the purchase side <e>", "<cs> i failed to follow the reasoning of the speaker on the back benches opposite <e> <s> the noble lord on the front bench keeps telling us that these people are not going to sell their houses that they do not want to make a profit out of them and that they want to continue to live in them there will therefore be very few which will come on to the market <e> <s> there seem to be crossed wires between the front and the back benches on the opposite side <e> <s> the previous speaker spoke about having the opportunity to sell and move around the country but the noble lord on the front bench does not think that this is what will happen <e>", "<cs> i do not disagree with this proposal but i should be grateful if the minister could clarify two points <e> <s> because many parents cannot have children of their own they foster children at a very young age until those children become adults and i am wondering whether child in the new clause will be of help to the foster child <e> <s> secondly does a child of his embrace her as we would expect under the sex discrimination act <e>", "<cs> perhaps i framed my question badly and it was not readily understood but f was trying to speak quickly so as not to delay the committee <e> <s> i understand that clause contains a definition of a person who is a <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord can explain this <e> <s> is there anything in clause which would be a change <e> <s> if the tenant was going to make the purchase through a building society and not claiming the mortgage through the local authority would it be a similar facility <e> <s> in other words is the secretary of state really taking a similar line to what a building society would be doing if it was offering the mortgage instead of the local authority <e>", "<cs> that was the question that i did ask <e>", "<cs> i follow what the noble lord on the front bench was saying <e> <s> one can follow that argument through <e> <s> but then i come to the conclusion that the government must expect for ever and ever to be facing inflation <e> <s> one listens to the points put through the media that it is hoped to bring inflation down within the next three years <e> <s> if the government are so successful will the tenant he able to appeal to the rent officer when inflation is down for a decrease in his rent <e>", "<cs> i too found it extremely hard to follow and had difficulty in understanding the noble lord the minister although i appreciate that he is trying to save as much time as possible <e> <s> is it correct to understand that there will be no option for them to buy but that there will be an option for them to sell their leases <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for what he has said <e> <s> one is at a distinct disadvantage when listening to somebody who is reading a very complicated answer <e> <s> unless one is able to take shorthand and transcribe almost immediately one is in great difficulties <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for what he has said and also my noble friends who joined in supporting the amendment <e> <s> the thing that worries me is that lots of people feed lots of different figures into different things and different things come out <e> <s> we have to take it from what the noble lord says that the figures his department pushes in are the right figures and the right figures come out of the box <e> <s> therefore we have no alternative but to reckon that they are backing a winner <e> <s> what we are saying is that we are not so sure that they are <e> <s> i would have said it is impossible to assess the potential long-term effects of the statutory policy on the housing levy account <e> <s> the noble lord has had his experiences <e> <s> i should like to say that i have had experiences as well <e> <s> my experiences do not bear out what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the committee <e> <s> i hope that noble lords will be as concerned about the subsidies part of this bill as they have been about those parts of the bill which affect the private tenant living in private accommodation <e> <s> the costs of subsidies and the way they are outlined in the bill are of grave importance to the majority of people who live in rented accommodation in this country <e> <s> therefore there are approximately five million people affected by how subsidies are going to be paid in the future by the government <e> <s> i say that as an opening to moving the amendment because so many people do not realise the subsidy make-up and how it reflects upon the rent that the council house tenant has to pay <e>", "<cs> was that very funny <e> <s> i think i deserve an apology from the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i accept the apologies of both noble lords <e> <s> may i say that i too have been in politics for quite a long time and i know of the hurly-burly of being on a local authority as well as the hurly-burly of another place <e> <s> one accepts that there is a different code in this place and i objected to that code being broken <e> <s> i was not saying that i was not going to speak at great length <e> <s> the noble lord has now encouraged me to speak at greater length <e>", "<cs> i did not for one moment think that the minister would accept the amendment <e> <s> i do not know why he thinks i presumed wrongly about the local authority contribution automatically being increased year <e>", "<cs> i had expected to see the noble lord lord sandford stand up <e>", "<cs> then may i ask the noble lord whether he is going to speak <e>", "<cs> i am surprised that he is not going to speak because i happen to be a vice-president of the adc as well as of the ama <e> <s> they sent me some literature which touched on this point of the local contribution differential <e> <s> if the noble lord lord sandford is not going to put the point of view of the adc i feel that somebody ought to put it and i will take on that very humble role <e>", "<cs> while i thank the noble lord for that explanation is he aware that some of it was not directly relevant to the amendment which deals with a particular point <e> <s> i am concerned that the present grant limits are below current prices <e> <s> if owners were able to take up the grant with a higher percentage they would not have to pay so much themselves obviously if one cannot get the maximum because the grant has not been updated to take modern prices into <e>", "<cs> my lords i was quite surprised to hear the noble lord say that he did not <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that he said that he did not want the women to be discussing politics or hyper-politics <e> <s> are not the care of children employment for women and all the things that women are interested in just as important political issues as what the men think are important events <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for that very helpful reply <e> <s> i feel sure that when my noble friend lord northfield reads the official record no doubt his great interest in it will be furthered in the best way that he thinks is possible <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord sandford replies may i make an appeal to him to consider quite seriously those local authorities now using plastic sack disposal units in their areas <e> <s> for some people there is quite a burden when it comes to lifting the plastic sack out of the bin in order to place it on the pavement <e> <s> this is a considerable task for the elderly or for those households without male members <e> <s> problems arise with the plastic sacks once they are placed on the highway <e> <s> dogs or children may scatter the contents of the sacks around the roads before the refuse collectors arrive on the scene <e> <s> so i believe that the matter is not quite so simple as the noble lord lord sandford makes out and i support the minister in the observations that he has made on this particular proposal <e>", "<cs> may i thank my noble friends who have <e>", "<cs> i do not accept what the minister has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i was surprised to hear what the acc had said because part of their documentation states <e>", "<cs> my lords it really is not extending the bill in any way <e> <s> it is putting into the bill what local authorities have been doing for quite a long time <e> <s> many local authorities on what one might call the periphery of their area have need for <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the words were taken out of context <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the minister has given the reply that he has <e> <s> as the noble lord lord sandford said together with the noble lord who spoke on behalf of the acc these are the local authority bodies speaking for the whole of the country <e> <s> i might have thought that the minister would not accept it because i was speaking that might be the voice of the association of municipal authorities and therefore not perhaps particularly important to his partys thinking <e> <s> i should not have disagreed with that <e> <s> but the fact that all the local authority associations are concerned about the starting date shows that the government think very poorly of those who serve on local authorities up and down the country and take no notice of those officers who guide and give information to councillors <e>", "<cs> my lords i think my noble friend on the front bench mentioned the query that i raised in the house that there is no definition of the words direct labour organization <e> <s> i read carefully the point that the noble lord lord bellwin made in answer when i used the example of the city that i know best which has the equivalent of three direct labour organisations all under the control of different committees of that council and different officers <e> <s> i used the example for members of your lordships house who were not at that previous debate where the council had a direct labour organisation for its public works department another direct labour organisation for its housing department and another for another department which i have forgotten <e> <s> the noble lord lord bellwin most likely will remind me of it <e> <s> however we have three <e> <s> i was concerned whether all those departments would be one direct labour organisation under the bill <e> <s> when i read his reply i really was not satisfied <e> <s> i did not know whether he really did not understand my question because i put it so badly or whether there could be an answer this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble baroness lady masham for giving us the opportunity of taking part in this debate today <e> <s> as previous speakers have said what a variety of matters has been raised in this debate <e> <s> practically all aspects of disablement have been brought forward <e> <s> i was particularly interested in what the noble lord lord renton said because my three main points on the white paper are exactly the same as those which he has just raised <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is amplifying what i am saying <e> <s> instead of the government hoping could they desire or request <e> <s> i should like them to instruct <e> <s> we on these benches sat for many hours in discussing the housing bill and the local government planning and land bill and there is one minister in this government who will demand that local authorities do a lot of things <e> <s> i should like to see the department of education doing a little more than hoping <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to speak with at least a little experience of this matter <e> <s> for four years i was a representative of your lordships house in the european parliament and i was a member of the environmental committee <e> <s> this directive was constantly before us for the first two years that i was a member of the committee <e> <s> i want to reiterate what the noble baroness lady white said that our main concern when discussing the eec directive was that we should take great note of water pollution and health risks generally <e> <s> it was constantly said around the committee table by representatives from all member countries that the polluter must pay <e> <s> that is a well-known saying but looking at the legislation in the form of the regulations one sees what is perhaps a turning back of the clock with a relaxation of the dictum that the polluter must pay <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to oppose the bill and i speak in the capacity of a magistrate <e> <s> the cases that come before us in the birmingham courts arising from excess alcohol normally fall into three categories first the driver who is driving under the influence of drink more often than not having <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not dispute that the noble lord has seen it i am just <e>", "<cs> my lords from my experience in birmingham i would say that they buy it from pubs near the ground and in the last two years those pubs all close on saturdays when matches are being played in those areas <e>", "<cs> will the noble baroness give way <e> <s> may i point out to her that i have not been going to europe since the direct elections took place <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> i recognise that the majority of the excess was of course for the special needs and i compliment the minister on that <e> <s> but would he agree that the success of his departments advertising campaign has encouraged more applicants than can be provided with a grant from the money made available for local authorities to distribute <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the need to conserve energy and to obviate the difficulty that the government might be accused of misleading advertisement may i ask whether i heard correctly that the minister said that if there are local authorities which have waiting lists of applicants who want to benefit under the scheme he would give consideration to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble minister for that reply <e> <s> one has to feel a little worried that the education service of which school meals are part is suffering the real brunt of the education cuts being made by the government <e> <s> i am particularly interested in whether the minister could give us any information as to how she is protecting the interests of those children who are entitled to meals without payment and that the nutritional standards of those meals are beneficial to the children receiving them <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble minister say what action she takes with local authorities who might be envisaging the future complete disbanding of the school meal provision in their areas <e> <s> how then will the children who should be entitled to free meals be dealt with <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord who has just spoken will accept the fact that i shall not be following him <e> <s> my knowledge of scotland is very limited but perhaps i might say that my knowledge of the west midlands is quite extensive after spending over years in public life in that area <e> <s> in the past of course the west midlands has been a wealth creating region <e> <s> it had relative prosperity and job security for the people in the region <e> <s> it has been able in the past to assist in the more depressed areas of the country but in the west midlands we are no longer that rich parent <e> <s> we have come to the same stage unfortunately as some of the more depressed areas in the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that comment <e> <s> but i think he would agree that the department of trade the department of the environment the department of industry and the department of employment all claim to have some concern for the small business sector and it is shared between various junior ministers <e> <s> but in birmingham and the west midlands we also have what we call the well-managed companies the large companies the ici group the gkn group lucas metal box and other such companies <e> <s> what are they saying about the governments policy <e> <s> noble lords have mentioned two or three problems <e> <s> but what these companies are saying is that they are confronted with weak demand for which the government must take some responsibility <e> <s> the noble earl shakes his head but when i speak to the chambers of commerce and to industrialists they tell me not only about energy problems but about the high interest rates and all the other factors which are within the purview of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that there is grave disquiet among widows who are not earning and have no other income apart from savings and who now will have to pay tax on widows allowances when they start receiving that little bit extra which was given to them in the last budget <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord to spell that out in very clear english so that the widows themselves understand the position quite clearly <e> <s> because at the present moment that is not what they are given to understand at the tax offices <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he would make quite sure that more and more local authorities use the giro account <e> <s> because i would have said that the majority of local authority tenants have need to use the post office quite regularly whether it is for family income supplement or for retirement pension or whatever <e> <s> it is at that level that there needs to be more encouragement rather than at bankers order level <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with all that the noble lord lord young of dartington has said but i go along with him on the point that the needs of local people are well and truly served by their local representatives <e> <s> the needs of local people become apparent and so because they are known they can be met <e> <s> this evening i want to concentrate on the situation in birmingham and wish to assure the noble baroness lady faithfull that i have tried to glean the facts regarding this situation <e> <s> the facts have been given to me by those whom i would call very responsible people in that city <e> <s> it was not long ago that we had a debate on unemployment fostered from these benches and on that occasion i spoke about the serious unemployment situation in the west midlands <e> <s> as the minister the noble baroness lady young will recall i have recently tabled a couple of questions about the number of children taking free school meals <e>", "<cs> my lords while accepting what the noble earl the minister has said about community service would he not agree that it would be much more beneficial for the young people themselves and for industry generally if he were to do something which would further apprenticeships in all forms of industry <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether considerable help will also be given towards providing better access to pavements <e> <s> the blind handicapped in our community suffer considerable disadvantage as a result of vehicles being parked on pavements and because of the practice in many urban areas of placing refuse cartons and plastic bags on pavements which cause considerable concern to the blind handicapped <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to the noble baroness lady young for not being present at the start of this debate and so i did not hear her opening address <e> <s> i was in another part of the country and i hope that the noble baroness will accept my apology <e> <s> i feel very privileged because when we last debated the handicapped i followed the noble lord lord renton and listening again to his plea for that forgotten group of children and young people one could not fail to be impressed by the arguments which he put forward <e> <s> however when i read the bill and having listened to what previous speakers have been saying and also having read reports of the debates in the other place i have come to the conclusion having served as chairman of special services in birmingham for six years in the s that there was nothing new being placed before me <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness <e> <s> i take notice of that and i shall see that she gets some comments <e> <s> the real point is that young people today are having great difficulties in finding employment and the needs of the handicapped are much greater <e> <s> when they reach the age of to just when they are ready to take this final chance that is something that ought not to be missed <e>", "<cs> while having some sympathy with the point which the noble baroness has made i also should like to ask her a question <e> <s> she says in her amendment <e>", "<cs> while supporting the amendment i consider that the points raised by my <e>", "<cs> i should like to follow up what the previous noble lord said about the efficient use of resources <e> <s> i find it quite disturbing because the bill does not contain any resources at all <e> <s> so the government are saying to local authorities let us have some efficient use of resources <e> <s> is not that what local government are doing all the time <e> <s> that is what they are doing all the time without the government telling them to do it <e> <s> they try to use as efficiently as possible the money that they are allocated <e> <s> it may be that some local authorities will decide that the most efficient use of their resources would be in connection with grammar schools and assisted school places <e> <s> however it may be that another local authority would take the view that because they have a large urban population with a lot of children who are suffering deprivation the efficient use of their resources would be in connection with greater provision for special education <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble baroness lady faithfull in what she has just said and i think she has outlined her amendment in a very practical way <e> <s> i am also concerned especially as if warnock is taken to its final conclusion we shall abolish categories altogether which i think will be very difficult at the beginning <e> <s> but if we are abolishing categories there will be no way in which we shall be able to see whether there has been for some reason perhaps an influx in say spina bifida or an influx in blindness arising from the drugs being used in childbirth <e> <s> if we do not have categories that is going to cause a difficulty i can see but no doubt the noble baroness will explain that at a later stage <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can add some warmth to lady david after the coolness of lord alexander <e> <s> i think that my noble friend lady david said clearly in support that many local authorities were already looking at their special educational needs <e> <s> as the noble baroness lady young said all the educational authorities are having to look at the needs not only for special education but for primary and nursery schools because of falling population <e> <s> the need to look at special education as lady young has said is that there is a change of emphasis on the needs of the handicapped now <e> <s> it is for this reason that many local authorities are looking forward to make sure that they are taking into account the new kind of education that is necessary bearing in mind that many authorities are going to have to deal with more multiple handicaps in the future than they have in the past under special education <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what the noble lord said in regard to the government trying to use every educational means of extending technological education what opinion is he expressing this afternoon on the ugc grants which are being cut <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for her answer <e> <s> would she accept that there is widespread concern among many expectant mothers <e> <s> they feel that attendance for pre-natal care is time-consuming that it is not enjoyable that there is a lack of educational facilities and that this is due mainly to the shortage of staff and the lack of space <e> <s> what are the government doing to overcome those two problems <e>", "<cs> my lords while appreciating all that the noble baroness has said and realising her great concern and also her ministers concern may i ask whether she could try to get a little humanity back into the large hospitals where many expectant mothers feel that they are just like a parcel on a conveyor belt operating a system <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister not accept that the ugc have been very drastic in their cut-backs on the technological universities and is she aware that there is grave disquiet at the university of aston in birmingham a university which is turning out graduates who have no difficulty in getting jobs at all and whose research is of great importance to industry in the west midlands <e>", "<cs> my lords while considering community policing may i ask whether the noble lord will make comparisons between community policing which is taking place in the large urban areas and i speak particularly of handsworth in the city of birmingham where there are serious difficulties and that which is taking place in areas such as devon and cornwall <e> <s> will the noble lord accept that one of the real problems with community policing is that normally there need to be mature policemen on a community police basis because the younger members are still learning the areas in which they are operating <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to associate myself with the remarks which have been made by the noble baroness lady david because when i read in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble baroness lady jeger who i think put up an excellent case for the ethnic minorities <e> <s> the noble baroness drew attention to the words form and language known by the local education authority to be understood by the parent <e> <s> i think that it is important for us to realise that many parents are completely bewildered when they have to meet officials of any description <e> <s> not all parents are equally knowledgeable or pushy <e> <s> therefore perhaps the approach to the assessment if we accept what the noble baroness says must be in a way that the parent really understands <e> <s> here i am talking particularly of those parents in the community who want the best for their children but who are perhaps not the most vocal and not always the most intelligent group <e> <s> however they want what we all want which is the best for their children <e> <s> therefore the form of language must be readily understood <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow what the noble baroness has just said <e> <s> while i go along with feeling that the parents ought to have the information i think we have to recognise that it is not just the general practitioner or the hospital consultant this is going to be a multi-discipline team making this assessment and one would feel that they might not always come down per cent <e> <s> together <e> <s> i suppose it is like being a member of her majestys governments cabinet you do not agree with all the decisions all of the time but you go along with them because you are a member of a collective team <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to support the observations of my noble friends especially those of my noble friend lady jeger <e> <s> i was particularly upset by what the noble lord lord renton said about certain things happening earlier than other things <e> <s> some comments have been made this afternoon on education of children up to years of age and i feel sure that at present no local education <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make a few comments on the third reading of this bill <e> <s> i shall be brief but i wish to emphasise the points made about lord boyle <e> <s> i knew him when i first entered local politics <e> <s> i was one of the councillors in the handsworth division <e> <s> although we represented different points of view in different parties before he became a member of your lordships house lord boyle was thought highly of in the handsworth division <e> <s> he involved himself with the ethnic minorities there and showed his humane attitude towards the disadvantaged even if they were not suffering from physical or mental disadvantages <e>", "<cs> my lords to those noble lords who are not aware of the fact may i say that i am the last speaker before the winding-up at which some of your lordships might breathe a sigh of relief <e> <s> listening to noble lords this afternoon there appears to be an enormous range of local variations in the quality of mental hospital care and if care includes not only nursing and medication but habilitation and rehabilitation then there is a need to avoid inconsistency in what is a national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank my noble friend lady david for initiating this debate and all those who have taken part in it <e> <s> i feel as though i am the pupil at the bottom of the class no doubt cribbing from every other speaker who has been on their feet <e> <s> i intervene with some trepidation seeing the list of formidable speakers including those who are to follow especially as somebody with no letters after my name only justice of the peace <e> <s> so my education has been perhaps the education of life <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl also consider that when we are talking about the handicapped we must also remember those who are suffering froms sensory handicap <e> <s> more often than not when we speak about the handicapped we are referring to those who are physically handicapped <e> <s> i do not want to take away any of their advantages but the blind and the deaf also need some special consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness agree that practices of the kind outlined in the question cause great concern when we measure them against the campaign which is still being waged to make outstanding payments to prisoners of war <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i too may thank the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter for initiating this debate <e> <s> i must say that i do not go along with a lot of what he said but then no doubt he would not expect me to <e> <s> nevertheless i enjoyed the way in which he put forward the points in which he believes and perhaps i might take the opportunity now to put the points on which i disagree with what has been said in this debate <e> <s> i think we are left in no doubt that the country is faced with an economic crisis that unemployment keeps on rising and that this causes anxiety and unhappiness to individual families <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened again interestedly to what the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has said but i think that those figures were a different set of figures from those used by the noble baroness lady stedman <e> <s> we bandy figures around because we get them from different sources <e> <s> i think that the figures used by the noble baroness lady stedman as to the burden of rates on most businesses show that they are a very low proportion of the total costs <e> <s> anyway that burden of the rates would be passed ultimately to the consumer and therefore i do not accept the argument used by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e>", "<cs> my lords in standing here for the very first time i do so with a great deal of trepidation especially as we have been considering in such great detail sex and sex shops <e> <s> i will not dwell on that aspect at great length but in commencement i should like to thank the noble lord for introducing the bill and for introducing it in such a simple way that we quite quickly understood the various clauses bearing in mind that he apologised to us that the printing of the bill had been delayed <e>", "<cs> my lords could the minister tell us whether the sales have been evenly spread throughout the country <e> <s> has the take-up of council tenants been even <e> <s> further has he any figures to let us know whether unemployment is having a slowing down effect on housing sales <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank lord hunter of newington for giving us the opportunity to debate the national health service this afternoon <e> <s> i stand here i suppose as a consumer though i do not think that puts me in a category different from anybody else <e> <s> if we had not got consumers and patients we would not need health services quite obviously <e> <s> but from the course of the debate so far it would appear that the pattern of illness concerning the care of the elderly that is the heart disease the strokes the blood pressure the arthritis and the chronic depressions of old age will by definition require that much more care for most of the time is provided in or near the patients home and after hospital treatment one would expect treatment to be continued by the general practitioner and the community health service <e> <s> therefore there is this great need in reorganisation for the effective and comprehensive primary and continuing health service to be firmly based and if community care is to become a realistic possibility and not just an empty phrase then in my view definite guidelines will need to be established as the new organisation takes place <e>", "<cs> i think that when we are looking at this amendment we are looking at something much more fundamental than the one aspect that we have just spoken about <e> <s> i think it was lord belstead who on second reading praised the major role that local authorities played in shaping this bill <e> <s> those remarks were contained in column of the report of the second reading debate <e> <s> i think he explained quite clearly what the reasons were for this bill and he cited the criteria <e> <s> the criteria were that the provisions should be well precedented in recent local legislation and should be necessary and uncontroversial <e>", "<cs> as to schedule and the repeal of these bills i am looking at merseyside west midlands cheshire and west yorkshire are not the powers which they have under those recently enacted acts of parliament repealed under clause <e> <s> have i misunderstood the bill so much that i have misread that completely <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will tell me that i am wrong but i concluded that under the first part of the bill those parts of the bill that are before us in schedule would be repealed <e> <s> am i wrong <e>", "<cs> could i ask the noble lord the minister to bear something in mind when he is considering village halls and i go along with the sympathy which has been expressed in that regard <e> <s> in the large urban areas there are big housing estates <e>", "<cs> while i thank the noble lord the minister for that reply it has been found extremely difficult to prosecute under the legislation in respect of the pedlars certificate <e> <s> local authorities have experienced the greatest difficulty because the definition of movement normally allows the pedlar to operate as a street trader because of the very fact that he walks ten fifteen or twenty yards away from his stall <e> <s> it is therefore extremely difficult for local <e>", "<cs> having listened to what the minister has said i am not really satisfied with that reply <e> <s> anybody who has any knowledge of street trading and market streets will know that they are always the biggest bone of contention to any local authority they are always subject to fracas about who gets their first and whose position is best <e> <s> they are not the places of harmony that the minister seeks to explain to us <e> <s> the very fact that the holder of the street trading licence or consent may employ any other person to assist him leaves the situation wide open for the person who gets there first to set up two stalls very close together <e> <s> it makes the job of the licence holders extremely difficult when the fracas starts <e> <s> having listened to what the minister has said i am not happy <e> <s> i will read what he has said but i shall most likely raise it again on report <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> while not disagreeing with the noble viscount and i have not been approached by any organisation i am a little concerned about the long distance lorry driver <e> <s> going along trunk roads in the country one finds that many long distance lorry drivers use the lay-by and take their hot bacon sandwich and mug of tea and their rest as part of the statutory rest time which the lorry driver has to take <e> <s> i am concerned that perhaps that might be abolished by this clause <e>", "<cs> i am overwhelmed <e> <s> i appreciate the observations which the noble lord made <e> <s> in the second reading debate he was not so helpful <e> <s> perhaps in his re-reading of the debate i and my noble friends convinced him <e> <s> i thank the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i will not keep your lordships very long at this late stage but in view of the fact that the whole of the amendments we have before us are asking that the local authorities should take over these powers i think that before the government take any decision they should make sure that the local authorities are consulted in great detail <e> <s> it is all very well giving them powers but the powers are likely to involve them in expenditure <e> <s> we heard what the noble lord said about battersea in birmingham we have three very large homes for dogs and the only way the police can operate the dog licences act at the present moment is by the co-operation of the voluntary bodies who will take the dogs from the police <e> <s> but who will take the dogs from the local authorities if there are no voluntary bodies in the various localities <e>", "<cs> i accept what the minister said namely that the code of practice that has been brought forward is a welcome step for people in whatever properties they are occupying but it will have a direct bearing as the noble lord said on multi-occupied properties <e> <s> as i said this matter has concerned local authorities and statutory undertakers and it has been a case of one playing off the other to get bad debts in but it seems that we are now going in a more sensible direction <e> <s> if i understood the noble lord correctly many thousands of pounds will be saved by local authorities if the code of practice comes into operation <e> <s> in view of the ministers remarks i will withdraw the amendment at this stage on the basis that shall read what he said to see whether i need return to the matter on report <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak on clause stand part <e> <s> i listened to what the noble lord said about the order procedure and i want to reiterate some of the points which my noble friend has previously made <e> <s> it is incumbent upon the government to give to local authorities adequate notice when they are considering repealing or amending any provisions of a local act <e> <s> two or three days notice is just not good enough especially when we consider that local authorities do not lightly decide to seek their own legislation <e> <s> over a long period of time local councillors and officials think earnestly about possible legislation which they consider would be effective in their own area <e>", "<cs> i take in some of the points that the noble lord has made but one presumes that consultation could have taken place earlier <e> <s> i mean in the repeals section we are repealing acts before the ink in which they have been printed is even dry to be perfectly candid <e> <s> there is the humberside act <e> <s> we are repealing that under three clauses according to the latest schedule <e> <s> the oldest one is the county of south glamorgan act the most controversial one the first one of the local government ones <e> <s> in the case of all these local authorities with their officers and with their councillors spent money and spent time and used the parliamentary time and one wonders for what <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister agree that local authorities have great difficulties regarding the improvement and modernisation of what we call the inter-wars stock <e> <s> does he also agree that many local authorities are facing grave difficulties regarding post-war stock <e> <s> that is those properties built in the late s involving system building and concrete structures <e> <s> these local authorities have a very serious problem which is not at present adequately covered by government grants <e>", "<cs> i think that the last speaker exaggerated what he said about local government <e> <s> it is very easy to pick out two london boroughs and speak as though they are representative of local government throughout the country <e> <s> as the noble lord is fully aware i come from the birmingham local authority with a great deal of experience in that city <e> <s> birmingham was one of those cities which decided to charge lower bus fares within the confines of the west midlands public transport area <e> <s> by no stretch of the imagination was that local authority marxist or anything like that <e> <s> for us to use such arguments to put over the power of changing the voting system is with all due respect to the noble lord lord harris of greenwich a little unfair <e>", "<cs> it is shown on a big graph <e>", "<cs> i have a great deal of sympathy with what the noble lord lord hill has just said <e> <s> that is aggravated in those local authorities that also had the county precept to repay <e> <s> they will have to repay the county precept as well as the rate increase that they levied which places a double burden on those local authorities <e>", "<cs> perhaps i did not put the case as clearly as i ought to have done <e> <s> as the noble lord said if the services that were being provided were equal then i would support the noble lords case <e> <s> but more often than not the new service will be a lesser service <e> <s> i use the example of local governments that have decentralised their housing repairs <e> <s> they have very good housing repair depots on all their large council housing estates <e> <s> the tenants are in direct contact with the man who sits in a little shed and the work is carried out <e> <s> therefore there is an excellent service <e> <s> i was saying that if that excellent service were taken away and privatised and there is a worse service there would be difficulty in getting the original service back <e> <s> i go along with what the noble lord says in the case where a better service is provided but i doubt whether that would be so <e>", "<cs> i thank all noble lords who have taken part in debating the amendment and all those who have spoken have done so from a great deal of experience with the exception of one noble lord who freely admitted that he did not know anything about gas stoves and gas cookers <e> <s> i was particularly impressed by the observations of the noble lord lord miles my noble friend lord ross and those who emphasised the employment situation <e> <s> lord miles took pride in the fact that the gas showrooms sold only british appliances made in england was something to be proud of he said and in another context we expect noble lords opposite to express great fervour about the british made symbol <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also join in the tribute and the thanks to the noble lord the minister <e> <s> it was at the last stage of the bill when i raised a point regarding community halls and tenants halls because one felt there was a bias towards the country <e> <s> therefore on behalf of myself and my noble friends i would like to thank the noble lord the minister for considering the urban areas when he puts in the community halls and other similar buildings <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister also elucidate on the same point as it affects the farming community who in many parts of the country go around selling produce such as eggs potatoes and cabbage or whatever is in season <e> <s> are they a part of or an activity ancillary to a trade or business <e> <s> i feel sure many local housewives and especially campers during holiday periods look forward to the farmer or his employee bringing round these fresh farm products especially those of us who come from the cities and who never see these fresh foods unless we go on holiday <e> <s> are they covered too by this phrase activity ancillary to a trade or business <e>", "<cs> my lords did i understand correctly from what the noble lord has just said that those of us who live in the cities this time i suppose will have our milk safeguarded as well as the fruit juice the potatoes the bread and everything else that comes round <e> <s> if that is so and i heard him correctly i go along with him <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join the observations of the noble viscount lord ridley <e> <s> i was concerned to see that the interests of the lorry driver were safeguarded <e> <s> but like the noble viscount i am a little worried about the words interrupts or is likely to interrupt <e> <s> i speak with a little legal knowledge from being a magistrate and i understand completely what the word obstruction means <e> <s> to me it has a legal connotation and it is often used by the police in traffic offences <e> <s> but i have never heard the words interrupts or is likely to interrupt <e> <s> i do not like the term and i wonder whether it has a legal connotation <e> <s> is it used by the legal profession or is it a new term which the civil service wants to put into legal provisions <e> <s> like the noble viscount i am concerned about the connotation <e>", "<cs> i thought it was quite interesting that when we started this afternoon the noble lord the minister said that the idea was to probe the governments intentions <e> <s> i must say that the questions which have already been raised by my noble friends and by noble lords on the liberal benches have been very probing but the intentions of the government are not coming out very fast <e> <s> while i admire the lord advocates simple legal interpretation he spoke as though it was almost like picking up a pipe and dropping it down in a field and away we go <e>", "<cs> bgc will have to reduce its pressure <e>", "<cs> but the bgc will have to drop the pressure <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord get back to the point made by my noble friend lord ross of marnock <e> <s> the noble lord the minister began by asking us to probe the governments intentions so may i ask the noble lord a question <e> <s> my noble friend lord ross of marnock explained to the house in great detail how the gas corporation works now that it has its capital programme and capital approvals and then it goes forward to build its pipe-lines to give its services <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to thank the noble earl for his explanation <e> <s> i must say at the beginning that i am not going along with his point of view <e> <s> i say this quite candidly to the noble earl <e> <s> when we moved the amendment in committee and all shades of opinion supported it the minister after the result was declared said that perhaps we would be able to explain what this amendment meant and what its effect would be in the totality of the bill <e> <s> i was listening with great interest to see whether he had worked out with his advisers what we thought it meant <e> <s> we were quite clear what we had put down in our amendment and it was the noble earl who quite clearly asked my noble friend the chief whip what it meant <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not know about the noble earls letter <e> <s> if he tells me what his letter is i shall tell him what my letter is <e> <s> it is as simple as that <e>", "<cs> my lords mine happens to be dated th june so we do not have the same letter <e>", "<cs> if the noble earl wants the date of the national gas consumers council letter it is th may <e> <s> i do not know whether that coincides with his correspondence <e> <s> the letter says <e>", "<cs> my lords i was trying to be particularly helpful to the noble baroness <e> <s> it was not any kind of trick question <e> <s> i can talk on the one subject at one time <e> <s> i do not want to keep the house any longer than is necessary <e> <s> i understand and appreciate very much the great concern of the noble baroness for the safety angle we have been discussing at length and the work that she has done to endeavour to overcome some of our difficulties <e> <s> if she would say that she would accept this amendment perhaps i can curtail the observations i want to make with the permission of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i presume from that that the amendment will not be accepted <e> <s> the genuine concern that the noble baroness lady macleod has about safety which is recognised by all members in this house is something we wanted extended in our amendment to make quite sure that satisfactory standards of service and supply to consumers are maintained <e> <s> i do not want to go into the philosophy behind the bill <e> <s> that is the philosophy of the government and it is quite right that they should be putting forward that philosophy <e> <s> but in putting it forward i think it is important because gas is one of the natural assets that we have that the supply is recognised by all consumers generally <e> <s> consumers need to understand that their supplies and their services will be maintained <e> <s> it depends on whether you are going to put in gas central heating gas cooking gas heating and spend money <e> <s> you need to understand fully that the service and the supply to consumers are maintained <e> <s> for that reason i move my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords regarding the amendment i and my noble friends are disappointed regarding what we would have said was a very clear amendment <e> <s> i cannot see anything imprecise <e> <s> i would have thought that the man in the street could have understood those words <e> <s> there are a lot of words in the bill which many people will not understand at all <e> <s> it seems a strange observation that the noble earl should make about it <e> <s> its wording reads <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the minister agree that many of the units of housing accommodation are in the areas that have a reputation for being what is called rough <e> <s> would he not agree that many local authorities with tenant consultation are using their best endeavours to give hope where despair was prevalent because many tenants were condemned to live in what one might call architectural monstrosities <e> <s> would the noble minister assure the house that his department will continue to support the priority estates project <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support my noble friend lord underhill in this amendment <e> <s> i think that he has quite clearly spelt out the arguments that the minister used on the last occasion when he accused us of being vague and of inserting our amendment in the wrong place in the bill <e> <s> be that as it may i think that it is incumbent upon the house to record that noble lords from all sides of the house fully understood what we are trying to achieve in that amendment <e> <s> my noble friend lord underhill made it quite clear <e> <s> if it was not quite clear then we are underestimating the intelligence of noble lords in that debate <e> <s> our intentions were quite clearly understood <e> <s> they were solely to promote the interests of consumers <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble minister in view of the trends what the government are doing to obviate the inequality of the national health service <e> <s> the black report shows quite clearly that there are many parts of the country which are receiving an inadequate service from the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government aware that there is a strong interest among commercial undertakers who are wishing to use the river severn <e> <s> in supporting my noble friend may i ask whether the government would agree that it is highly desirable that the commercial interests plying the waterways should be encouraged especially in regard to the river severn <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us whether the proposals will deal with the future of consumer representation in relation to nationalised industries when they become privatised <e>", "<cs> my lords the particular point that i was concerned with was to do with british airways <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the usefulness of the university of aston absolutely imperative for employment in the west midlands <e> <s> is the minister aware that the university of aston attracts to its research a tremendous amount of money from industry in the west midlands which is of paramount importance to not only the west midlands but the economy of the whole country <e> <s> is he not aware of the grave disquiet that is arising at the university of aston <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has just said how difficult it is to be no <e> <s> on the list <e> <s> how much more difficult it is to be no <e> <s> on the list and to follow the advocacy of my noble friend <e> <s> i apologise to the noble baroness that i was not in my place when she addressed the house <e> <s> i was attending what i thought was an important committee to do with the blind handicapped but i shall read what she had to say and digest it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say that i feel that i belong to a party that embraces men and women <e> <s> then we get to the noble earl lord halsbury when he spoke about nurses pay <e> <s> it is true that the problems of settling the health service pay dispute is a problem that the government will have to face up to <e> <s> there again the labour force employed by the health service is predominantly female <e> <s> then we had my noble friend lady ewart-biggs who again made special mention of one-parent families drawing attention to their difficulties and pointing out that it was predominantly mothers who had to go through these difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the government must be fully aware by now that everything that we call success stories in medical treatment under the national health service is falling into jeopardy because of government cut-backs <e> <s> the breast screening at marsden is a follow-up to what is happening at tadworth it is a follow-up to what is taking place in birmingham the curtailment of kidney treatment services in the queen elizabeth <e> <s> it is the medical success stories that are being so severely cut back <e> <s> would the minister consider not only the royal marsden but all these success stories where the medical profession have done so much for the benefit of the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that forgings for the automotive industry enter spain bearing an import duty of per cent <e> <s> by contrast for the united kingdom and the eec there is an import duty of only per cent <e> <s> accepting what the noble lord the minister has said regarding spain entering the eec will he give some advice to those industries in the west midlands that are in the forging industry regarding how they can overcome the unemployment situation that is facing them in the interim period <e> <s> though they have competent management and a skilled and hard-working workforce they cannot compete when they have this gross imbalance of import duties <e>", "<cs> in thanking the noble lord for his reply i would say that all we are hoping to do and i think the noble lord would agree with us on this is to make this mobile homes legislation perhaps the best act <e> <s> this is two bites of the cherry on what is a comparatively small problem regarding housing <e> <s> in view of what the noble lord has said we accept his undertaking that he will ensure that it is in <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord how he equates the skill of an arbitrator who will be a one-off person as against the skill and expertise of a rent officer <e> <s> the arbitrator might be doing something in devon another in the north-west and another in the midlands completely isolated people <e> <s> so far as i can see there is no need for somebody with the qualifications of an arbitrator <e> <s> how will they be able to do the jobs which the noble lord felt that the rent officer could not do <e> <s> i find that quite unacceptable <e> <s> with regard to the principle that some people have chosen to live in mobile homes that is their choice in the same way that other people choose to live in a bungalow by the sea or wherever <e> <s> i think it is important to recognise that having chosen they have a right to protection in the same way as the tenant of a council house the tenant of a private landlord or of a flat <e> <s> because they are a very small group of people and have chosen a different kind of housing i am afraid that the more we discuss the bill the more we shall find ourselves in the same difficulty as on the previous bill on the same issues <e> <s> i would therefore sincerely ask the minister to be much more generous than he is being at the present time <e> <s> we have accepted that there is a need for the site owner to be dealt with equally fairly <e> <s> for that reason we will press this issue to a divison unless we get a much clearer understanding from the noble lord that the tenants of mobile homes will get equality with the site owner <e>", "<cs> i was not <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble minister it must have been the way in which i smiled at him <e> <s> i readily withdraw the amendment on the undertaking that he has just given <e> <s> perhaps it will be possible for us to talk about another amendment or i could leave it to the minister to bring forth an amendment at the report stage <e> <s> i am heartened by what he said so long as we achieve the principle in which our amendment is enunciated <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the minister agree that local authority building and housing programmes take longer than a few months to plan and implement <e> <s> may i also ask the minister whether he realises that the governments policy of cut and spend makes it almost impossible for local authorities to plan ahead on capital programmes with any degree of certainty <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord the minister tell the house whether the sale of these extra houses will help in any way at all to keep down rents of council tenants who cannot afford to buy and who as the secretary of state has already announced will have to pay a further p per week increase from next april <e>", "<cs> my lords if the figures that the minister has just given show a per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble lord give any advice to local authorities in the west midlands area in particular where large industrial establishments have been completely closed down which has resulted in acres of dereliction <e> <s> can the minister give any encouragement to local authorities about what they are to do with that land <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble minister to tour the west midlands area and see these derelict sites <e> <s> if he could do something about getting industry on to these sites we should be only too grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords before i speak to the amendment may i ask the minister to accept my best wishes on his appointment <e> <s> we are all pleased that his abilities have been recognised by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord the minister from this side of the house for this amendment <e> <s> the noble lords lord campbell of croy and lord avebury put arguments at committee stage on the subject of definition and it so happened that we on this side of the house had exactly the same sort of amendment to put down but the noble lord lord bellwin became the second cousin removed and got there before we did <e> <s> it is for that reason that we welcome this amendment <e> <s> we welcome it because we believe it is important in government legislation that definitions of this type <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord the minister for repeating the statement which was made in another place <e> <s> i understand that acas met the employers side yesterday and that certain options were put forward <e> <s> perhaps two of the most important options were the rapid implementation of ways of improving earnings and of extending improving and developing the industrys productivity scheme <e> <s> we hope that those options will be discussed by acas with the unions this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations to the noble lord the minister for taking note of our amendments for phrasing them in legal wording and for inserting them into the bill at this late stage <e> <s> however there are two points which i should like the noble lord to consider <e> <s> during committee stage he asked if it was the view of noble lords that this bill should contain a requirement that a copy of the site rules should be made available to occupiers perhaps at the time when they were offered an agreement <e> <s> he went on to say that if noble lords did think that this was desirable he would consider it <e> <s> we on this side of the house feel it is highly desirable and would press the minister to remedy this point as the bill goes through another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i would like to thank the minister for bringing to the house the statement made in the other place <e> <s> we on this side of the house obviously place the greatest importance on the urgent resumption of negotiations which can lead to an early end and an hounourable end to this industrial dispute <e> <s> one welcomes the ministers statement because if one read this mornings press it looked as though there was going to be a significant breakthrough and that had then collapsed <e> <s> therefore we welcome the ministers statement that that is not now so <e> <s> when the minister talks about paragraph of the mediators report i think it is important for the house readily to understand that paragraph of the mediators report is clear <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened very attentively to what has been said by the noble lord the minister but i must say at the outset that we on these benches cannot accept the principles on which the bill is based <e> <s> we have serious reservations about several clauses and the minister has said nothing to satisfy our disquiet or to allay our suspicions <e> <s> we would accept that the water industry is big business we do not quarrel with that <e> <s> but we say that the needs of the community and of the consumer must be clearly recognised <e>", "<cs> to what age did she live <e>", "<cs> my lords it was a third <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> he said that it was about a fair pricing policy <e> <s> that was the point that i was recognising <e> <s> the noble lord has said that that is what it is all about it is to get prices down <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that the general needs index has acted in a contrary way and has directed resources away from inner city areas particularly those areas where housing action programmes were going on under the housing authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords having heard what the minister has said my noble friend begs leave to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not being here during one part of the debate <e> <s> i was present at the opening of it but i then went upstairs to a committee of the house <e> <s> my comments will be mainly to do with the west midlands <e> <s> i get a little concerned when people bandy about the word efficiency so easily but never define what they mean by it <e> <s> to most people who travel on buses and who do not want to wait in the bad weather the efficiency of a bus service is measured by its frequency <e> <s> but there are other factors that one has to consider <e> <s> therefore when that word is used it ought to be defined <e> <s> i am a bus and train traveller in the west midlands where the authorities have integrated transport <e> <s> it has been very carefully developed there as well as in the birmingham area <e> <s> the local authorities have nurtured and extended bus and rail services between one area and another <e> <s> that is thought of in the west midlands as an efficient local transport system <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for giving us the benefit of the statement that has been made in the other place and we on this side of the chamber give a general welcome to it <e> <s> we are grateful for what has been made available but it is unfortunate that the areas to which the resources have to go our most needy areas in the main are large manufacturing areas which have suffered great deprivation because of mounting unemployment there <e> <s> i am thinking in particular of coventry a city which is in the category of an area of need but which years ago was booming and did not know how to spend its money <e> <s> it has now fallen into the category of an area of great need <e> <s> i think too of sandwell and walsall both in the west midlands areas of high manufacturing <e> <s> they were very fortunate areas but they are now being placed in the category of areas of great need <e> <s> no doubt the census that has been used will give us the reasons why we are having to extend the special need areas <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not an auction of local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that that is a very small percentage of the total number of water consumers per cent <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that per cent <e> <s> of the severn trent water authority is a very small proportion of people <e> <s> would he not agree that which is the approximate cost for having a water meter installed is a very heavy cost especially for those for whom it is supposed to be more beneficial to have one installed <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble minister clarify <e> <s> did he in answer to me say that water consumers can fix a do-it-yourself meter themselves <e> <s> is he suggesting that water consumers go and buy the meters and install them themselves <e> <s> is that what he said <e> <s> a do-it-yourself kit <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the minister for reading to us the statement that was given in another place <e> <s> the minister has spelled out quite clearly the terms of the settlement and of course those were published fully and in great detail in todays national press <e> <s> therefore i do not wish to dwell on the figures or the percentages because the minister obviously has to use the figures to his best advantage to damp down any suggestion that the government have retreated from their pay policy <e> <s> the minister draws attention in the statement to the financial loss that is incurred by individual manual workers <e> <s> what i would say to the minister is that principles are not always equated to pounds shillings and pence <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the very able way in which my noble friend lady nicol moved this amendment <e> <s> the amendment has the support of the three local authority associations <e> <s> it carried the names of the noble lord lord sandford and the noble viscount lord ridley both of whom are presidents of local authority associations and the ama has as its representatives today my noble friend lady nicol and myself <e> <s> so all three local authority associations are in favour of this amendment but they are also concerned that the government are showing such a lack of confidence in directly elected persons <e>", "<cs> could the noble lord help us a little here <e> <s> i am in favour of the amendment <e> <s> do we understand and i believe the noble lord lord ardwick made the same point that the people who will be on the regional water authorities will all be appointed by the secretary of state <e> <s> we hope that the minister will accept the action that we took on the previous amendment and take that up when he makes the appointment <e> <s> if the members are all appointed by the minister they are therefore all equally capable one would expect or the minister would not have appointed them <e> <s> he has given the power to the chairman so does it really matter because they are all really good people who have been appointed if the vice-chairman is selected by the remaining members of the group <e> <s> is it terribly important that the secretary of state or the minister has to say no we are going to have so-and-so <e> <s> if he has nine picked men and he has singled out one as extra special could he not let the rest of the authority choose their man <e>", "<cs> i am disappointed with the reply because all the other speakers definitely asked for numbers <e> <s> they wanted one two three or as many as four <e> <s> we are not asking for any numbers <e> <s> we are just asking the minister to consider anybody whom the trade union movement suggests <e> <s> the trade union movement was not saying that it wants one two three or four <e> <s> all i can hope is that the consultations which the minister talks about will include among all the other bodies the businessmen the farmers and all the others a very large representation of the population of this country <e> <s> if the noble lord will not accept our amendments and for various reasons he has said <e>", "<cs> may i from these benches thank the noble lord the minister for the assurance he has given to the committee <e> <s> we shall look forward to seeing the guidelines <e> <s> i would like to say on behalf of members on these benches how much we appreciate the words and the contribution made by my noble friend lady serota <e> <s> her great knowledge convinced the house that here was something that ought to be righted and we are most appreciative of her comments <e> <s> i should like that to be publicly recorded <e>", "<cs> i shall not keep the house very long because i think many noble lords have expressed good points of view on why the press <e>", "<cs> the government have found them <e> <s> i sincerely hope that they will be more efficient <e> <s> but is not that a reason for letting the public know <e> <s> will they not want to know how much more efficient these six or nine people are than the or people <e> <s> will the government not want the public to know that they are saving money and giving better service <e> <s> i thought that would be the first thing that the government would have wanted known <e> <s> as my noble <e>", "<cs> may i follow up something the noble baroness lady masham said something which was brought out quite clearly to me when i was in tyne and wear quite recently <e> <s> i think the government accept that the family is a rather important part of the social fabric of the country <e> <s> i think it is important when parents are travelling that they should be able to take their children with them <e> <s> as my noble friend lord underhill said many of the local authorities now operate a fiat fare system which is encouraging the family to travel together <e> <s> the family is a unit <e> <s> the family goes out and sees the surrounding countryside or the city and all that they have to offer <e> <s> i am sure this is something that all of us would want to encourage <e> <s> as the government are so concerned with the family anything which keeps the family together ought to be supported not only by words but by financial means as well <e> <s> therefore i think this is rather an important amendment <e>", "<cs> it is rather worrying for some of us that we should constantly be debating london transport services <e> <s> they are only one of the undertakings in this country and it is unfortunate that they are always used as an example <e> <s> i come from the west midlands and we have nothing to hide <e> <s> indeed it might be well for the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter to come to birmingham and the west midlands to see what goes on with an intergrated service <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl say whether the education system itself is at fault regarding truancy <e> <s> when i say at fault i am referring to the problem of non-academic pupils perhaps attending education establishments which are geared completely to academic students <e> <s> the figures i have from one local authority in the country prove quite conclusively that its truancy figures are some of the lowest in the whole of the area and that is an area of high unemployment and one that is geared to perhaps a much more vocational type of training for the non-academic pupil <e>", "<cs> i was supporting the noble lord lord nugent of guildford and i should like to clarify one of the things which the noble minister said in reply to the amendment <e> <s> is it the yorkshire or the south yorkshire water authority i have forgottin which that may be the authority that takes over the trusteeship of the fund <e> <s> i thought when the noble lord replied that he said that the representatives on the new body which will be looking after the pension fund would be representatives from other water authorities so they would be members of a water authority <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord lord nugent has great knowledge and great experience and he has drawn that to our attention with the amendment <e> <s> he i think is in the same predicament as noble lords on this side of the committee <e> <s> what concerns everybody is what will happen to the procedures when the national water council is abolished <e> <s> i want to reiterate something that the noble lord lord nugent said it is a topical amendment it is topical because we have just had a recent water dispute <e> <s> i am not so sure that you change legislation because you have a topical interest because years of collective bargaining in the water industry has not <e>", "<cs> i wonder if the noble lord could say whether the land drainage findings will be published and made available before report stage <e> <s> otherwise my noble friend will be in some difficulty because at a later date there will have to be amending legislation which for back-benchers is almost an impossibility <e> <s> if therefore the noble lord could say that at report stage the government will be able to say how the land drainage committees might be reorganised it might help to solve the problem <e>", "<cs> on clause stand part i will not keep the house very much longer but i have listened with great interest to what the noble lord has been saying <e> <s> at report stage will he outline to the committee the activity which is expected from the international advisory company limited which was made mention of in the other house during the course of committee b <e> <s> the main arm of the national water council which had been doing all this work under the guise of the international advisory service has now been formed into the international advisory company limited <e> <s> i just ask the noble lord whether on report he can perhaps bear that in mind <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i have listened very attentively to what the minister has said <e> <s> as he rightly said this is an important issue <e> <s> it was discussed at very great length in committee in another place and there was all-party support for the need to consider very seriously the section agency arrangements <e> <s> i should like to thank the minister for the amendment that he has placed on the marshalled list but not yet moved <e> <s> that is in line with an agreement in the other place that there would be an amendment when the bill came to your lordships for consideration <e> <s> so we thank the minister for going that far and we look forward to the report stage bearing in mind the undertaking that he has just given to us <e>", "<cs> i rise briefly to support the comprehensive remarks of the noble lord lord sandford <e> <s> as he rightly said this is a probing amendment <e> <s> on second reading noble lords in all parts of the house voiced the desire that the consumer consultative councils should be not just watchdogs but watchdogs which were capable of biting <e> <s> that is what we need to be assured of by the minister how far will the consultations take us in achieving real consumer consultative councils <e> <s> perhaps our proceedings on the bill have taken rather longer than might otherwise have been the case because whenever something comes up for discussion we are told the draft guidelines are being considered or people are being consulted on that and so on <e> <s> the bills passage would have been speedier if the guidelines and consultations had been completed before this stage <e> <s> indeed we should not need probing amendments such as this if the bill explained what the cccs will comprise and what their duties will be <e>", "<cs> were those the guidelines that were made available to members some of which were placed in the library <e>", "<cs> i am not sure what the minister means by the water industry itself <e> <s> does he mean the chairmens association <e> <s> what does the water industry itself mean <e>", "<cs> i do not want to keep on interrupting the noble lord but that is what we are trying to find out with the amendment <e> <s> where are all these different things going to <e> <s> we know at present where they are they are with the water space amenity commission or with the national water council <e> <s> we want to know where they will go in the future <e>", "<cs> it might do <e>", "<cs> all that i would say is that if one looks at the <e>", "<cs> i am not satisfied with the remarks that the noble lord has made <e> <s> i am even more muddled now that he has finished than i was when he started <e> <s> i thought i had it clear in my mind <e> <s> because of the lateness of the hour it is important for us to get on <e> <s> i know that my noble friend lord melchett has spoken about the field of conservation <e> <s> but there are all kinds of sport that go on now and their interests are equally important because they will clash on many occasions with those of the conservationists <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for that information <e> <s> he said capable of being covered as well as being covered <e> <s> certain matters have not yet presumably been defined and they are capable of being covered <e> <s> i shall read what the noble lord has said in reply <e> <s> it is an important issue <e> <s> when the bill becomes an act and these guidelines and details are set down will the names of the chairmen of the water authorities be announced and also the names of the chairmen of the committees <e> <s> everybody knew that the noble lord lord nugent of guildford was the chairman of the national water council <e> <s> if people know who is the chairman of x y or z they can make approaches at that level if desired <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the massive increase in unemployment can the noble lord give us the figures for the increasing number of children who must obviously be able to benefit from school meals <e> <s> those figures would be very enlightening to your lordships <e> <s> i understand that at present in birmingham it would be nearly per cent <e> <s> of the children in the schools <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the english and welsh housing conditions survey showed that the largest number of dwellings in poor condition were those in owner-occupation <e> <s> four million of these are in the occupation of old-age pensioners who are living on very small incomes <e> <s> would the minister agree that he needs to look at the grants system as it affects old-age <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord look particularly at the anchor housing trust which are very concerned about this issue and were one of the pioneers in trying to arrange what we call a package deal for the old-age pensioners who are in the owner-occupied category <e>", "<cs> my lords it was interesting to hear what the noble lord said about the hard harsh look <e> <s> before local government reorganisation local authorities also had to look at the services provided by public transport <e> <s> they had to look at them very seriously because of the amount of money they were going to raise in rates <e> <s> but i never heard of one large municipal authority changing its mind regarding childrens fares <e> <s> i stand to be corrected but i do not think i heard of one large local authority that decided to change its policy on cheap fares for children <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister must be aware that the reports that have been coming from the department of the environment and the national water council show that there is very serious concern regarding nitrate levels in water <e> <s> evidence shows quite clearly that the nitrate levels are rising steadily owing to an increase in the use of fertilisers <e> <s> does the minister not recognise that there is a real need to monitor very carefully the findings and the evidence in his department regarding pure water supplies to make quite sure that we are conforming to eec nitrate levels which in some water authority areas are now at the maximum level allowed <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a long debate concentrating mainly on the housing associations <e> <s> however i should like to begin my comments by dealing with the building regulations <e> <s> we on this side of the house agree that there is evidence to show that quite clearly there is a need for re-casting the building regulations <e> <s> there may be an argument for saying that they need to be brought up to date <e> <s> as the noble minister has said there is a need for them to be made more understandable <e> <s> however as regards making them more understandable i point out that the group of people who drew up the regulations that we now find so difficult to understand will be the same group as will be drawing up the new regulations <e> <s> so all i would say to the noble lord is make them much clearer than you did last time <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of these benches i should like to support the noble lord lord sandford <e> <s> like the noble lord i recall how late the debate was on the consumer clauses and we obviously did not go into a great deal of discussion <e> <s> i think we were all led to believe that the noble lord who answered would as is the normal practice which <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord lord bellwin has perhaps not been able to convince his colleagues <e> <s> he pointed out that it is very difficult to write into the bill actual numbers in relation to people appointed but i would point out that the next but one amendment that we are to discuss refers quite clearly to at least two members whom the secretary of state will want to appoint because they have experience of land drainage or fisheries <e> <s> no doubt people who have experience of land drainage or fisheries are important people <e> <s> they are not people i would normally bump into though no doubt they are very important people but i would not say that they are any more important than local authority representatives who have been democratically elected <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord the minister for going to such a great deal of trouble over the arrangements for the sewerage functions <e> <s> i should like to thank him not only as regards this clause but as regards other clauses as well <e> <s> i know that this was the subject of quite a long discussion in the committee stage <e> <s> i accept that it is a complicated procedure <e> <s> but the minister has gone to a lot of trouble and he has made it much more realistic than it was in the past and perhaps i could also say fairer fair to both sides if i can use that phrase the local authorities and the water authorities <e> <s> on many occasions i criticise the minister <e> <s> this time i am saying thank you for giving practically everything for which we asked <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the comments just made by the noble lord lord sandford <e> <s> i am terribly disappointed that the noble baroness lady trumpington is not present <e> <s> her question and the written answer from the noble lord lord skelmersdale have caused us to reconsider this matter which if time had allowed might have been discussed at the earlier committee stage <e> <s> i had hoped that the noble baroness lady trumpington would have been present <e> <s> we know that she has a great interest in consumer affairs otherwise she would not have tabled the question <e> <s> had she been present we could have heard her comments and observations <e> <s> we could have known whether she was satisfied with the written answer that she has received from the noble lord lord skelmersdale <e> <s> we could have learned whether she thought that the written answer was sufficiently comprehensive <e> <s> so as i say i am disappointed that she is not here to let us know whether she was satisfied with the answer <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i was not sure whether he was talking about the future consultative councils that is why i was frowning or whether i had missed the point and he was talking as though there were some consumer consultative councils now <e> <s> if he could clarify that he was talking about the future i am with him <e>", "<cs> point <e>", "<cs> i did not follow the answer which the noble lord gave to my noble friend lady scrota <e> <s> no doubt she understood it more than i but it sounded like double-dutch to me <e> <s> no doubt reading <e>", "<cs> i should like to make one quick comment <e> <s> one must be pleased with the reply which the noble lord lord skelmersdale has just given to my noble friend lord melchett <e> <s> this was a matter which we discussed at great length in committee <e> <s> as my noble friend said a considerable number of people representing sporting recreational and environmental interests are concerned <e> <s> we are all sympathetic to the difficulties in which the noble lord finds himself when he comes to answering our questions <e> <s> but if the government had done their homework correctly if consultation documents had gone out if the government had set down their guidelines when they had the results of the consultation documents and if the government had then brought forward their bills we would have saved a lot of time <e> <s> noble lords have had to find out the answers and in many instances in committee the guidelines became mixed up they became almost like waterloo station <e> <s> we shall now be at report stage without any guidelines <e> <s> this bill will become an act of parliament before we have the guidelines and before the consultation document has been returned <e>", "<cs> my lords is it correct that the new certificate will be awarded for a grouped course which obviously takes into consideration preparation for the world of work <e> <s> in view of that does the minister feel confident that young people will stay on at school or college to take this examination when they can obtain work experience and get per week under a youth training scheme <e> <s> does he not think that the young people will choose the a week and the youth training scheme in preference to the new arrangement which he is bringing forward <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the ministers reply does it mean that the who will be taking this course or it may be less than that if the take-up is lower will be taken off the unemployment figures of young people <e>", "<cs> my lords in seconding the amendment that has been moved i should like to follow up what the noble lord lord sandford has said by agreeing that when the noble lord lord skelmersdale has the opportunity to reply he should indicate how far we have got <e> <s> it would appear that fresh guidelines are to be issued because some of the points have already been covered in statements which the noble lord has made to the house either through questions for written answers or in committee <e> <s> therefore it would be helpful if the noble lord could give us some indication as to when the second consultation document will be issued and perhaps the date of the return <e> <s> perhaps he could also help by enumerating some of the matters which he thinks ought to be included in the second consultation document <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house should also like to thank the noble lord lord skelmersdale and to pay a tribute to him <e> <s> he listened to our criticisms during the committee stage and discussed with us later the possibility of coming to some compromise <e> <s> the amendment which has been tabled today goes a long way towards what we all desired which was that even if the guidelines are not printed on the face of the bill parliamentarians in both houses should be aware of what they are <e> <s> the very fact that a copy will be laid before the house for any purpose under this clause is something for which we would thank the noble lord <e> <s> we admire the speed of the skates he used in being able to bring this forward in three days <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord commented that there are problems and difficulties and said that the government have not made up their minds on even this point <e> <s> if we are to have some guidelines as he has just said the point about the ombudsman has become part of them <e> <s> i should like to support my noble friend because it is very difficult for citizens to find out where to make their ultimate complaint when they have approached the water authority itself the consumer consultative council and everybody else who might be able to help <e> <s> people may still not be satisfied and my noble friend lady serota could give many examples of where a complaint about maladministration has finally gone to the ombudsman <e>", "<cs> my lords if i remember correctly the bill had its second reading in this house without any support for the government <e> <s> i do not think there was a noble lord or baroness in this house who stood up and gave any support to the noble lord lord bellwin <e> <s> but it is true to say that as we went through the committee stage we were able as the noble lord said to make some very substantial amendments to the bill <e> <s> it was very pleasing to hear the noble lords thanks to my noble friend lady serota who raised a most important point about the ombudsman <e> <s> we can also congratulate ourselves that guidelines are being laid down for the consumer consultative councils <e> <s> as this is the only democratic part of the bill which is left we welcome these guidelines <e>", "<cs> i must say how disappointed i am from this side of the committee with that reply <e> <s> it bothers me when any local authority wants to repossess under the succession rule especially in cases such as we have heard enumerated today by the noble baroness because more often than not they have been daughters or sons who have been in that home all their lives <e> <s> if it is the father who dies they may remain but if it is the mother who dies that is the end of it <e> <s> when local authorities take that line i think it a very harsh line and one that we ought not to encourage <e>", "<cs> i listened to what the noble lord said and with all due respect to the noble lord i think that if one did not know anything about housing at all one would still not know anything when he sat down <e> <s> the noble lord will correct me if i am wrong but i was under the impression that previously housing authorities would not sell off their properties at any discount lower than the cost of building them <e> <s> in listening to the noble lord i was not entirely sure whether that is the fundamental change that they will be able to sell properties at less than it cost to build them <e> <s> i am not sure what is meant by the cost floor date <e> <s> that is a new one to me <e> <s> if the noble lord could help me on that i would be grateful <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord tell us what he means by the cost floor date <e> <s> that is a completely new one to me <e> <s> i have tried to follow what the noble lord said <e> <s> i think that i understand what he means by the cut-off date <e> <s> i am not quite sure whether what i think is what he thinks but i shall not argue on that <e> <s> but i am not sure what he means by the cost floor date <e>", "<cs> i think that my noble friend mentioned district heating schemes <e> <s> is it not the case that if half a dozen of the pulled

order to avoid falling standards <e>", "<cs> i think we were pleased to hear what the minister has just said that they are having discussions with tenants associations <e> <s> this of course was part

about interpreting the word independent <e> <s> of course the independent inspector is the local authority who will not be tied up with any organisation in any body and therefore will be completely neutral <e> <s> he will inspect and there will be no reason to think that he will be anything other than independent <e> <s> that is why we on this side of the house feel that perhaps the approved inspectors might find themselves in great difficulty as the workload is placed upon them especially when contracts need to be fulfilled very quickly to keep the cash flow going in the building industry in which they are involved <e> <s> if we want to define independent it is important that the noble lord lord bellwin recognises as i feel sure he will that it is the local authority building control inspectors whom we can really designate as independent <e>", "<cs> with regard to what the noble lord has just said of course there are new circumstances <e> <s> i readily accept that the

would have thought it would be much more important for these plans to be deposited with the local authority <e>", "<cs> in view of what the noble lord has said and because we think that matters of

whether the results of the consultation will be available before the bill to abolish the glc comes before the house <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i might emphasise some of the points that have already

order and then another one in october bearing in mind that the local authorities themselves are going to have to make great changes <e> <s> they are forced to put up their rents for council houses

agree that practically every tenant who is granted a council house or flat becomes a secure tenant on the granting of that tenancy <e> <s> therefore to use the argument about a person becoming a secure tenant after two years seems to be rather spurious <e> <s> if the government feel so strongly about selling more and more houses why not offer them for sale as soon as the person becomes a

have said that originally <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for a very full answer to us and for the thought that he has given to it <e> <s> the noble lord has spelt out quite clearly that the education act is a very wide act regarding employment of all kinds of people <e> <s> i did not go into it but as the noble lord said it is not just school caretakers it is all kinds of people that very often have to be removed from their jobs because of difficulties of employment in education and as the noble lord said of providing suitable accommodation <e> <s> it is true that in most local authorities they are housing authorities but i think it is the same principle that is arising in the shire counties where they are not housing authorities and the ilea find themselves in difficulties

amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is report stage is it not <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may follow on what my noble friend lady birk has outlined i raised at committee stage this question of shortening the period from three years to two <e> <s> listening to todays debate one understands that if one increases the discount one must get back capital receipts some way so one shortens the term from three years to two <e> <s> i was not brilliant enough to remember that point last time <e> <s> what we must take into consideration is that while we are doing all these things while we are increasing the discounts and shortening the period we are also and nobody has mentioned this increasing very substantially the rents of those who are still renting the properties <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords cemeteries <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister look again at what i have said <e> <s> perhaps i could discuss two points with him which i feel that perhaps

minister think that i am speaking to the wrong amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall not move the amendment <e>", "<cs> i listened carefully to the noble lord <e> <s> he said that there is no magic figure but

intended to catch only the glc <e> <s> this they did because their original target the per cent <e> <s> above caught corby and milton keynes <e> <s> therefore they set another target or another figure

clearly their friends <e> <s> whether or not the minister likes it that is the opinion <e> <s> as the noble viscount lord ridley said when he moved his amendment he was doing it only to get a dig at

undertaking that the government will organise a campaign by voluntary organisations <e> <s> health authorities and schools in a great effort to get the public involved in stamping out this evil

patients the physiotherapy that is so essential for them to start life again <e>", "<cs> my lords the comments i shall make in the brief time that i shall be speaking will be concentrated upon the west midlands county council <e> <s> that is not because i do not support the propositions which have been put forward on the glc but i feel that as the only speaker from the west midlands i should be

on the front bench <e> <s> although the glc is often quoted in this house <e> <s> the bill has to do with the metropolitan counties and the very many millions of people who are living in the metropolitan counties who seem to be completely forgotten <e> <s> perhaps they are forgotten because they are all in deprived areas of this country and areas where there is severe deprivation and very high unemployment <e>", "<cs> with all due respect that was a complete exaggeration of what i said previously <e>", "<cs> i feel it is unfortunate that metropolitan districts will not have the same representation on the interim councils as they have on the present councils <e> <s> i see no real points in any of the arguments that the noble lord brought forward <e> <s> the point about the workload has been expressed very well by other noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> it is not only the actual workload <e> <s> the fitting in of the meetings is going to be terribly difficult <e> <s> in the various district councils of which i am aware i have made extensive inquiries about this <e> <s> the question of conflicting afternoon and evening meetings has been well thought of by the districts and the county so that there is not a conflict of things taking place in different areas <e>", "<cs> the noble lord extended the number of representatives on the glc interim body by generously including the city of london <e> <s> would he do the same for the counties <e> <s> he has made an exception in an exceptional case <e> <s> those of us who come from the counties are saying tonight that there is an exceptional case and we should like him to look at this again <e>", "<cs> can the noble baroness give us any idea whether her remarks regarding the greater london council apply to the six metropolitan counties <e> <s> has she any reason to believe that they are not maintaining a quorum <e>", "<cs> i should like to support what was said by my noble friend and by the noble lord on the liberal benches <e> <s> i was a member of the new town staff commission which was a very difficult commission <e> <s> it dealt with the handing over of housing from the new towns to the local authorities with all the problems of dealing with housing staff in the new towns and with what would happen to them <e> <s> it was a long and detailed matter <e> <s> we sat for or months <e> <s> i think meeting very regularly and the reports were compiled and available to government <e>", "<cs> the question of the giving of information is one of the greatest causes of concern to the staff at present employed <e> <s> if the bill goes through and abolition takes place then at this stage the staff do not know where they will be going <e> <s> information must be provided by both sides <e> <s> as soon as the government have made their decisions that information should be given to the staff <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord aware that there is a little disquiet regarding information in the hands of lawyers who are employed by the metropolitan county councils <e> <s> there are many such lawyers who are subject to the official secrets act because they are serving the metropolitan police authorities and act on behalf of the police in civil matters very often in connection with claims against the police and that kind of thing <e>", "<cs> my lords seeing that the noble baroness was so kind when she brought forward her own private members bill for sunday opening may i ask her whether now that she is on the front bench she would be as diligent in promoting a bill as she was on the back-benches <e>", "<cs> my lords to us on these benches it seems rather complacent that the noble earl gives us all nice answers to the questions <e> <s> but we have student unrest thoughout the country because of the cut-backs and non-availability of places <e> <s> would not the noble earl agree that today the demonstrations throughout the country are showing quite clearly that the students themselves are not getting enough grants <e> <s> how on earth are we going to fill the places for girls and boys in science if we have to have these continual cuts <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be speaking mainly about the results of unemployment in the west midlands <e> <s> the noble lord lord balfour a few weeks ago when he opened a debate on unemployment said among other things that perhaps i was to blame because i did not get the train <e>", "<cs> if noble lords will give me half a minute i will draw to a conclusion <e> <s> we have cutbacks in housing policy which have already been mentioned <e> <s> my noble friend lord cledwyn pointed out quite clearly that in the conservatives election manifesto we are always hearing what they are going to do whether it is the abolition of the glc or whatever they are always saying it was in the manifesto there was a clear case that they would do something about unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister seen a copy of the <e>", "<cs> my lords we have witnessed the terrible consequences of the governments monetarist policies on the economy each and every day since the tory party first came to power in <e> <s> throughout great britain we have seen much of our industrial base seriously undermined and prosperous manufacturing areas like the west midlands where i come from turned into derelict wasteland <e> <s> only this week there was a question on the order paper about illness and suicide arising from unemployment <e> <s> i am convinced that glue-sniffing drug addiction and a more violent society have to be related to

noble friend lord ardwick and the noble lord lord bethell are not in the chamber <e> <s> those noble lords and myself have perhaps used stansted more often than most people because it was the airport

improved since direct elections <e> <s> to us it felt like a place in the wilderness <e> <s> i had to travel from the midlands <e> <s> it was a hectic journey taking normally between four-and-a-half

paper so it must be what i said <e> <s> i hope <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank my noble friend lady jeger for introducing this debate and all noble lords who have contributed to it <e> <s> my noble friend lord stallard said he would speak about two specific issues <e> <s> i wish to concentrate on one particular issue that is the mentally handicapped <e> <s> i am in full support of the principles behind the policy of care in the community that wherever possible mentally handicapped and mentally ill people should not be cared for in large institutions but should receive the care that they need within their own local communities <e> <s> i recognise that this policy is not an easy pattern of care to implement <e> <s> i also agree that some improvement in the provision of community-based care for the mentally handicapped has been accomplished over the past years <e> <s> however it must be acknowledged that the progress has not been sufficient <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that corby is an area that has employed a large percentage of male labour <e> <s> are the figures that he has given broken down into female and male labour or are the new industries in the main female orientated <e>", "<cs> not this one my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords before going into the details of why i support the bill i should like to draw the attention of the noble lord lord harris who listed examples of campaigns to the fact that there have been some successful campaigns <e> <s> the polio campaign the noble lord i believe would agree is a successful campaign <e> <s> the rubella campaign is another that is successful <e> <s> all of us can point to campaigns that have not been successful to satisfy our arguments <e> <s> we should also consider the very successful campaigns that have been run by the government and by local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the noble earl for that answer may i say that it does not encourage me very much because it does not give me any really detailed information <e> <s> one of the problems that the youth are finding with these programmes is that they are being heard but not understood <e> <s> therefore may i ask the noble earl to make quite sure that in the programmes that come under his jurisdiction the problems and difficulties of young people are fully understood <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl tell me whether the meeting at no <e> <s> downing street yesterday was part of international youth year <e> <s> has he read the reports in the national press of the discouragement felt by the youth who attended that meeting at downing street <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the secretary of state for the environment mr patrick jenkin who is recorded as saying in <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say on the point that the noble lord has just made that if i read the bill correctly there are no powers being given back to those local authorities <e> <s> they are going to the statutory bodies that are being set up <e> <s> they are not going back to the local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the noble baroness for that answer can she say whether the recommendations will be based upon the seven tests that will be applicable to women over years of age <e> <s> does she think that those recommendations will get rid of the anxiety and the despondency about the statements and the counter-statements that have arisen regarding the cytology programme <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble baroness answered the question regarding women of the age of may i ask her whether she was aware of the changing patterns of the disease <e> <s> is she aware that medical opinion is showing clearly that the disease is taking place at a much younger age than it was <e> <s> is she further aware that the british society for cervical cancer is of the opinion that sexually active young people from the age of years should become part of the programme and should be tested every three years <e> <s> are they to suffer until they are from a lack of preventive methods for health <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness really saying that the women of this country should not be allowed to have preventive health measures where applicable <e> <s> what she has just said is not what the department has sent out to health authorities <e> <s> they said that they must concentrate on those aged and over and give seven smear tests during their lifetime from years onwards <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord skelmersdale said that he would not be saying things i would agree with <e> <s> i am sure he does not expect me to agree with most of what he has just said <e> <s> what i was trying to point out clearly was that we on this side of the house are just as concerned to get value for money as are the government hence why spend millions of pounds every year on giving to homeless people bed and breakfast accommodation when they could be provided with housing <e> <s> is that value for money <e> <s> why waste money <e> <s> you have got no asset at the end of the year except somebodys chewed-up breakfast <e> <s> it seems to me elementary i do not think one needs to be a student of economics to regard that as being cost-effective <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that adjacent to st margarets in parliament square there is a private hire coach parked every day of the week advertising the three trips which it does round the london sights <e> <s> will he look into the matter because it is causing extreme congestion in parliament square itself <e>", "<cs> i should like to enter into the debate regarding the metropolitan counties <e> <s> since and the reorganisation the metropolitan counties are what we call the worse half of the two nations <e> <s> they are in the majority areas where there is the gravest unemployment and the highest amount of industrial dereliction <e> <s> they are either in development areas or else they are in assisted areas <e> <s> the government have recognised the difficulties of those areas the eec also through its regional aid has been giving them the infrastructure to help regenerate the areas <e> <s> so when we are talking about the metropolitan counties in the main we are talking about one half of the nation <e> <s> therefore it is important that their democratic voice and the organisation of local government is comparable with that of the metropolitan city of london and as so many people have said in this debate the capital city which all britishers love london <e> <s> therefore i go along with the sentiments expressed but i would make quite sure that the government which is decided on for the <e>", "<cs> my noble friend mentioned the birmingham area <e> <s> the west midlands forum of county councils covers all the areas including the travel-to-work area of the west midlands county <e> <s> their greatest concern is that with the abolition of the metropolitan county the chief strategic part of the whole west midlands conurbation which includes not only the county but also the shire counties around it will be the west midlands county <e> <s> it includes the motorway network of many major roads going north south east and west <e>", "<cs> this is rather confusing <e> <s> the metropolitan counties were established because of the difficulties of strategic planning <e> <s> the idea was for <e>", "<cs> are not these conferences purely advisory <e> <s> there is nothing statutory about the advisory bodies that will advise the <e>", "<cs> from listening to the noble lords reply i sometimes wonder whether the noble lord recognises how difficult it is for local authorities to get together on these matters <e> <s> the boundaries are so close together in the metropolitan areas <e> <s> if the noble lord was going to the west midlands an area which i know very well indeed he would not realise that he had left birmingham and had entered sandwell west bromwich or walsall because it is a completely built-up area <e> <s> if one crosses the road one can find oneself in another district <e> <s> therefore because of that and the historical background of the people who live in these areas to expect them to work <e>", "<cs> the point is that it is got together <e> <s> the west midlands county has got the act together <e> <s> what you are going to do is try to smash it all up <e> <s> that is the point of it <e>", "<cs> i listened very patiently to what the noble lord has just said but i did not hear him say anything about derelict land sites though most of the metropolitan counties have quite a large acreage of these at the present moment <e> <s> if we are to have restoration in the metropolitan counties something must be done about derelict sites <e> <s> those are the sites which have old industrial buildings on them and if we are to attract industry to the metropolitan areas we must compete with the green-field sites <e> <s> the metropolitan counties have to a great extent been getting rid of derelict land sites <e> <s> so will the noble lord explain how the districts will be able to do this in the future when many of them will be very much smaller than towns in the shire counties <e>", "<cs> i did not say that they were not capable of re-establishing derelict land but that it was financially impossible <e>", "<cs> i want to pose a question to the noble lord and ask him whether he really understands the traffic functions of the metropolitan counties <e> <s> if noble lords look back to they will remember that one of the reasons for setting up the metropolitan counties was to overcome the lack of co-operation between the highway authorities of the smaller areas that were operating at that time <e> <s> i do not know whether your lordships remember those older authorities but they were the large metropolitan authorities birmingham manchester liverpool and leeds and the surrounding shire counties <e> <s> therefore there was a clash of opinion <e> <s> this bill is reverting back to a clash of opinion but it is not reverting back to what all the district authorities used to do before <e> <s> it was only the major local authorities that had these wide powers <e> <s> it appears to me that perhaps the government really need to look at their proposals in and what they are proposing now because they will see a complete contradiction bearing in mind of course that the traffic problems are now times worse than they were years ago <e> <s> indeed that is an important point that one ought to remember <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e> <s> the noble lord said that the arrangement was working satisfactorily before but is he taking into consideration the serious problems that arose particularly in the west midlands which he knows as well as i do regarding the dumping of toxic waste the cyanide scandal and all the other things which went on <e> <s> is that the satisfaction that he wants us to have in the future that we had prior to <e>", "<cs> a leading councillor for solihull is on record as saying that after trading standards expenditure will be at a minimum in his local authority and that this function is regarded as a necessary evil <e> <s> so anyone who lives in solihull will have to get onto the backs of other authorities if they want their trading standards protected <e> <s> i give both of these examples because the shire counties rely very very much on what the metropolitan councils do <e> <s> i give one example which is an example of a local authority which said it would not be doing anything <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord drumalbyn has said the debate has been good <e> <s> as my noble friend lady lockwood and others have said trading standards is not a party political matter <e> <s> it is of grave importance not only to consumers but as has already been said to traders and manufacturers <e>", "<cs> i am not underestimating <e> <s> i was explaining the different functions that these officers have <e> <s> it is true to say that environmental officers were the old sanitary inspectors <e> <s> therefore they visit shops <e> <s> they see whether food is fresh and if it is mouldy for example they take action <e> <s> the trading standards officers also do that but they cover the wider field of food composition which the environmental officers do not do <e> <s> they also deal with labelling <e> <s> everyone is concerned with labelling to ensure that what is in the bottle or in the tinned goods is shown and for example if a product contains salt that is shown <e> <s> therefore they work closely with the manufacturers <e> <s> that is the point i was trying to explain and i hope now that the noble lord sees that there is a distinct difference in the functions <e> <s> the environmental officers could take over only per cent <e> <s> of the functions <e> <s> that would be my reply to the minister <e>", "<cs> with all those assurances i agree with the point of view that has been put forward <e> <s> i have listened to what the minister said i am satisfied and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend lord stallard <e> <s> i think all members of this committee who know my noble friend will appreciate the long service that he has given in the london area in helping those who are disadvantaged in all fields whether they be the disabled the elderly or the homeless <e> <s> because he feels so strongly about the matter i give him my support <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord tell us what he means by revenue support being too high <e> <s> does he mean that everybody has been travelling on the cheap and some cheaper than others <e> <s> what does he really mean by that phrase <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord will give way <e>", "<cs> may i ask just one question <e> <s> i have listened with the greatest of interest to what the noble lord has said but on behalf of all metropolitan councils i wish to say that the deprivation the unemployment is much higher than it is in the london area <e> <s> the anxieties are as great as in london and when he said he had the shape about right i should say that the shape he gave for the metropolitan counties is like the piece of jigsaw that is lost under the table that one can never find <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord the minister answers those queries i should like to follow up what has just been said by the noble lord lord kilmarnock <e> <s> as the noble lord lord elton knows i am very concerned about the metropolitan <e>", "<cs> yes i am extremely sorry i mean millions <e> <s> is the noble lord able to give the breakdown as to the amounts which will go to the glc areas and to the metropolitan counties <e> <s> i think that previously there was a difference between the figures <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will be able to tell us the difference tonight so that those of us in the metropolitan counties will be able to see how badly we do <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e> <s> it will be with the exception of two of the <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down he has mentioned richmond on several occasions <e> <s> if one looks at the metropolitan counties there is a very serious difference between london and the metropolitan counties <e> <s> if one looks at manchester liverpool and birmingham they are large cities in their own right and the constituent districts around them in many cases are quite small districts going up to perhaps or as against more than a million in the case of birmingham <e>", "<cs> following on from what the noble lord who has just sat down has said perhaps i may say this <e> <s> if one looks at the west midlands one sees that for a two-thirds majority they need five out of seven for three-quarters as mentioned by the noble baroness lady carnegy they need six out of seven <e> <s> if noble lords know anything about the politics in the <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask whether as regards section we are to be led to understand that the money which will go to economic development in the future will be part of the millions that were given this afternoon as voluntary body money <e> <s> will the same money be used for both purposes <e> <s> under the present plans a local authority in a non-metropolitan area will have access to a p rate yield under section p of its own resources and p from the county council <e> <s> that will be p in the shire county areas that the districts can have <e> <s> does this not mean that the metropolitan authorities are back again with just p <e> <s> those being in very deprived areas where i believe the noble lord the minister himself has said that the work done by the enterprise boards and the economic development committees have really made an impact upon job regeneration <e> <s> if what i said about the county councils and the districts which are in their county is correct is it not unfair that they should have the benefit of p and does not this create a two-tier of local government finance <e> <s> if i am wrong i shall be glad to hear the opinion of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord write to me on the point that i raised regarding p that goes to the districts that are in county areas under the two-tier system <e> <s> can he explain that in a letter to me <e>", "<cs> i shall be equally brief <e> <s> i should like to support both the amendments which have really the same end product if one can so describe it <e> <s> one has to take into consideration what was said by the noble lord who has just spoken <e> <s> because of the way they were organising their annual review three metropolitan counties were able to bring forward their severance schemes before nd march <e> <s> at the moment i am not discussing the glc <e> <s> the other three metropolitan counties were not so far advanced <e> <s> however i understand that the west midlands were placing theirs before their financial resources committee at the beginning of july and it was a case of putting their suggestions through all the voluntary bodies all the various committees <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord consider giving greater emphasis to the derelict land grants which the government give so that that land can be recovered and used for these particular purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord visit euston station occasionally <e> <s> announcments are made daily that owing to difficulties with the appliances a certain train will be delayed one hour or will be delayed an hour and a half <e> <s> my personal experience travelling from birmingham to euston over the last month is that five delays have taken place which have made the journey over three hours long and every explanation has been something to do with the engine or that the brakes have been faulty or that something else has <e> <s> is the minister saying that he is running down british rail <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me great pleasure to follow the noble lord lord beloff <e> <s> i too am a bus user and so the noble lord has no special privilege that i do not have <e> <s> but i can drive and i drive a car though if one lives in a city it is often better and <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister also consider the fact that there are many women who have been very active in local government and that they too should be considered along with the old boy network as being suitable chairpersons <e>", "<cs> my lords listening to the noble lord the minister i felt that we should be at headingley where england would be sure to win because not only is he going to bowl the balls but he is also going to hit them and obviously act also as umpire <e> <s> what he said to be truthful has not bowled this maiden over <e> <s> what he has said falls short of what the metropolitan counties have been doing in the field of trading standards <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down he was compiling evidence in the same way as was the noble and learned lord lord denning i appreciate that <e> <s> but does he completely refute the evidence which is in the london boroughs <e> <s> his noble friend on the front bench will tell him quite emphatically that the co-ordination of the london boroughs is a nonsense <e> <s> they tried it <e> <s> i think it is true to say that the fact that now

london boroughs escape from performing these functions <e>", "<cs> my lords they do not work together <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support my noble friend lord stallard and perhaps emphasise some of the points he has made <e> <s> i wish to reiterate the point that he made regarding the greater london council when the problems and difficulties were enumerated and the whole organisation went over to london regional transport <e> <s> as my noble friend has said when that organisation was passed over protection for the concessionary scheme was enshrined in section of the act which placed a reserve duty on london regional transport to secure a concessionary scheme if no scheme exists <e> <s> the amendment would make sure that the concessionary fare schemes which were written in for london would be applicable to all parts whether it is the metropolitan counties or as my noble friend said the shire counties <e> <s> there should be no difference in a concession which is going to be given to the elderly and to the handicapped <e>", "<cs> why not my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for giving way but rate capping is applying in the area that i am talking about <e> <s> birmingham city is being rate capped so that for every million it spends in excess it has to pay million back which is a substantial sum <e> <s> i am concerned that if the districts are putting forward their money using birmingham as an example they are already putting into the concessionary fares scheme and the tag of million has to be picked up <e> <s> who is going to find that among the district authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords yes we do <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give any examples of how the inner-city teams have been able to use government funding more effectively than birmingham liverpool manchester and newcastle were doing before the teams moved in <e>", "<cs> my lords my question was whether the minister could give us examples of any action taken and about what the teams have done <e> <s> can the noble lord give details of any positive schemes that they have set up <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord the minister replies can he answer the question about the two-thirds <e> <s> i have been trying to work out what clause means <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister mean that there are two different interpretations which will cause a difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow up something that my noble friend baroness birk has said <e> <s> what concerns me is that the secretary of state is saying in this bill that he wants to make quite sure that he is looking at manpower levels in particular <e> <s> yet when the government answer any questions which concern local authorities or which as in question time today have to do with manpower levels in the hospitals they always give the answer it is not our policy to interfere with local authorities or hospitals as the case may be as long as they work within their budgets <e> <s> why are the proposals for these new authorities any different from the governments so-called policies of noninterference with manpower service levels as long as they fall within the budgets <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer although i would have been pleased if he had included in it the numbers of those supporting abolition and those against it <e> <s> but from the submissions that have been put forward is the minister aware that large retailers the national farmers union and the bow group have gone for reform as against outright abolition <e> <s> has he any comments to make on that <e>", "<cs> my lords if when the report has been fully scrutinised the minister finds <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add to what the two previous speakers have said <e> <s> i do so taking into consideration the noble effort that the noble lord lord sandford has made on behalf of serplan <e> <s> i again draw the attention of the minister to the co-ordinating committee that operates in the west midlands as a planning organisation <e> <s> the west midlands county is sitting round the table constantly with the shire counties of stafford warwickshire shropshire herefordshire and worcestershire which i should say are all very notable shire counties <e> <s> the west midlands county is in constant contact with them to protect the green belt and to see that development is taking place in exactly the right places <e> <s> i should have said that that is of equal importance to the conurbation of the west midlands as london is to the serplan authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support my noble friend lord dean <e> <s> i know that we have already received some assurances from the noble lord regarding the staff commission <e> <s> i speak with some experience as one of three people who

takes place in identical circumstances <e> <s> many of the staff know full well that there will be no job at the end of the road when the bill is finally passed <e> <s> they know it full well because

question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply but i do not think that the trend to which he refers applies in the west midlands where there is still a downfall in employment prospects <e> <s> only this week there has been another substantial loss of jobs <e> <s> are the government doing enough financially to help major exporters and i speak particularly of those in the west midlands who are trying to capture export markets <e> <s> i use as an example the export of cars <e> <s> british leyland is still suffering under the penalties

get from any of the regions to gatwick to catch a aeroplane at or in the morning <e> <s> this obviously means that it is much more expensive for people travelling from the regions <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the minister to interpret what he means when he says that he is trying to be helpful to local authorities <e> <s> he has used the phrase two or three times already this afternoon <e> <s> to a certain extent this is stifling discussion <e> <s> it is a nice way of saying that he will be considering all these things later <e> <s> but really we are discussing the bill now <e> <s> one would have hoped that the government in bringing forward the bill would be able to answer those points <e> <s> i hope sincerely that the minister will explain how he is trying to be generally helpful to local authorities <e> <s> while deregulation registration and tendering are introduced three other major events are taking place in the metropolitan areas <e> <s> the effect of the ever-tightening protected expenditure limits and in some cases rate capping obviously require a tremendous amount of paperwork and considerable management effort to see that targets are achieved <e> <s> so the local authorities will have equally as much paperwork as the ministers men <e>", "<cs> with all due respect to the noble lord i had concluded my remarks when he stood up <e> <s> i have made my statement <e>

bus services are very satisfactory <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord tell us how that would operate in the pte areas where they are going from one district council to another <e> <s> if they <e>", "<cs> my lords it is essential that this important public service should not become a political football and that its uncertainty should not be clouded as it is at this moment <e> <s> we have heard from noble lords during the course of the debate of the different deadlines when the districts will take over <e> <s> the later deadline now proposed prolongs the uncertainty with no guarantee that adequate arrangements will be forthcoming particularly since the districts have not yet met any of the previous deadlines <e>", "<cs> while one welcomes the points that the minister has made one must read the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords after the minister has obtained the new figures and the redefinition will the government be considering putting any more financial resources into overcoming the problem which is of paramount importance now without having any further reports <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister tell the house what position the inner city authorities will find themselves in after the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am concerned also with liverpool and manchester they are all in the same predicament <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to present a humble petition on behalf of several hundred men and women resident in the west midlands county area which reads <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i as somebody who comes from a metropolitan county say that i think it would be rather unfortunate if the metropolitan counties were dealt with in any lesser way than the shire counties or london transport <e> <s> i think that it is incumbent upon the government to be fair in this matter <e> <s> when one listens to the noble lord i think that that is what he is trying to say <e> <s> but we have to remember that the majority of the population who are travelling on buses are living in the metropolitan counties <e> <s> he is therefore not acting fairly to the metropolitan counties <e> <s> he is acting unfairly to the majority of bus passengers <e> <s> for that reason i would ask him to give great consideration to what my noble friend lord carmichael has said <e>", "<cs> my lords may i follow on the point mentioned by the noble baroness lady carnegy <e> <s> in the metropolitan counties they are almost divorced from direct representation <e> <s> in some cases there has been only one person from the local authority on the pta although sometimes there are two or perhaps three <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord stallard whose name is attached to this amendment offers his apologies to the house <e> <s> he has a long-standing commitment <e> <s> i offered to put in a few words on his behalf <e> <s> however they are my words and not those of my noble friend lord stallard <e> <s> i support the amendment of the noble lord lord henderson <e> <s> all of us i believe agree that bus services are essential for many groups in society particularly the elderly and the disabled <e> <s> when we talk of the disabled we have to

comes to the department and discusses the increased charges for telephones he might be more sympathetic to the telephone users <e>", "<cs> my lords for a period of six years i served as a representative of the handsworth area on the birmingham city council <e> <s> i know the area particularly well <e> <s> during the period that i have been away from that area which is now about years

also set up its own inquiry as a city council under the eminent barrister julius silverman an ex-member of the other place <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister confirm that the secretary of state for employment is in birmingham today speaking to teachers <e> <s> the local newspapers and radio stations are full of his visit <e> <s> i only hope that the noble lord will be convincing the teachers that they ought to have more money for the excellent job of work they do in schools <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister give some consideration to the accumulated capital receipts held by those authorities which have to deal with inner city deprivation to enable some of them to use those capital receipts to take care of properties in need of repair and improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords while it may be that the noble lord takes notice of such reports when does he propose any action <e>", "<cs> my lords may we ask the noble earl to make quite sure that his honourable friend is aware of the decision that was made in this house after a long debate upon the issue <e> <s> will he ask the government to consider the point of view expressed in this house so that it becomes part of the legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell the house where the copy of the leaflet is placed so that we can give advice to other people <e> <s> where is it available and from where can we get it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord if he will make quite sure that it is placed in post offices where many of the people who are compelled to accept social security payments are also those who are paying high costs for their electricity <e> <s> it would be advantageous if the leaflet were placed in post offices <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord be giving support to dairy milk chocolate productions in the ec instead of the obnoxious name that might have to be used if we conform to regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord considering any facilities whereby the regional airports might be used to extend the number of visitors going north of london <e>", "<cs> my lords in the inner cities there is a larger proportion of young people than in any other parts of the country <e> <s> can the noble lord give us some details as to how these young people in the inner cities can be helped where there is a shortage of

lords i think that perhaps the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that the dairy council is concerned about the amount of butter being produced due to the excellent results of good farming are the government considering the recommendation that those persons who are aged or on social security benefits should receive butter at a much lower price to enable us to get rid of some of the surplus <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak as a non-legal person <e> <s> i am however a magistrate in the city of birmingham where there are over magistrates <e> <s> there are individual courts

the duty solicitor is widely publicised <e> <s> it is not a secret number <e> <s> it is a well-known number that is contained in most telephone directories whether private or those issued by british telecom <e> <s> the person answering the telephone will automatically give the phone number of the duty solicitor who is operating in the birmingham area <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that the government are breaking faith <e> <s> when they cajoled local authorities to sell houses it was implicit in the discussions and in the debates in this house that selling the houses would release the capital for them to build other houses that were urgently needed <e> <s> the government are breaking faith if they do not now let them use the money for that purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords i also pay tribute to the noble earl lord cranbrook and the team that he had round him <e> <s> he has produced a report of vital importance not only to technology and science but also to the workings of local government <e> <s> the select committee report shows that local government services in science and technology are good and in some cases excellent <e> <s> that has also been said by noble lords who have spoken this afternoon so i hope that the minister will add his tribute to the work that the local authorities have done when he replies to the debate <e> <s> as the noble earl lord bessborough said local authorities do not always get credit for the work that they do and this is an occasion when the government should add their tribute to them <e>", "<cs> my lords it is late in the evening and the noble lord lord marshall is just leaving the chamber <e> <s> i intended to follow up the point he made that one should not divide the achievements of local authorities <e> <s> the noble lord can leave now that i have mentioned that and knowing that i support him <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that it is very difficult for people to understand the governments proposals when on the one hand they talk about targeting in on the inner cities and involving young people in the inner cities while on the other hand they squeeze financially very seriously those voluntary bodies that are operating mode b schemes which give basic training skills to those youngsters unfortunately not able to get on employer-led schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords can i ask the noble lord whether he will visit birmingham after he has made all the other visits where i understand on quite reliable information that there are over youngsters and yts schemes running mode b that are in grave and dire circumstances and will not be able to operate after april <e>", "<cs> my lords to make sure that there is no misunderstanding may we have a plain english version in <e>", "<cs> my lords coming from the west midlands i must say that what the noble lord has said this afternoon is no encouragement to that part of the world <e> <s> it seems amazing that in the second month of this industry year the government are having detailed talks the noble lord said they are at an advanced stage about selling off our manufacturing capacity <e> <s> the noble lord must realise that the west midlands which had the largest manufacturing base in the country until it was destroyed again finds itself in a difficult position <e> <s> surely it is hypocritical of the government to have an industry year and at the same time to be selling off parts of industry <e>", "<cs> my lords at the present moment the local authorities are publicising the need for elderly people to keep up their heating and make quite sure that they make all possible contact with the social security department <e> <s> it worries me that perhaps in the future with the local government bill local authorities will not be able to do that and neither will the government be bothered to tell people <e> <s> that is something which is of serious concern and i hope that the noble lord the minister will himself take that on hoard when local authorities cannot undertake this task and publicise the need to get in touch with the social security <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord look at the unemployment regulations to make quite sure that those who are unemployed can volunteer <e> <s> because there is a limit to how many voluntary hours you can give per week if you are on the unemployed register <e> <s> it might be that those regulations are deterring many people from doing this voluntary work <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord tells us that the government want us to be much more cost-effective and much more efficient but does he recognise that it is a complete waste of public money to pay out week after week for homeless people to live in appalling bed and breakfast accommodation when the government could be spending that money on providing them with decent accommodation <e> <s> i say that in the very kindest way <e> <s> we are constantly told to be cost-effective but the government practice is in completely the opposite direction <e>", "<cs> my lords in such a property-owning democracy would the noble lord consider the bid from the british leyland consortium and allow that also to be a participant in the business which it has set up <e> <s> i refer not only to the management but also to the employees in that organisation <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord to consider in addition the employee participation which has taken place in the british leyland organisation since the last reorganisation <e> <s> if he looks at the output record and at the days lost through strikes he will see there is no cause for criticism against the employees themselves making their input into the prosperity of the british leyland organisation <e> <s> when the noble lord speaks about the public are clamouring for a decision the noble lord demurs but i wrote it down and with all due respect i put the public are clamouring <e> <s> if i am wrong i apologise to the noble lord but the public in the west midlands are clamouring for a decision which will obviously ensure that the employment prospects are still kept intact <e> <s> that is most important as the right reverend prelate the bishop of birmingham has said <e> <s> it is also important to recognise that the public are not only in london but in the west midlands where these firms are <e>", "<cs> my lords when he is having discussions with chief constables will the noble lord recognise that rape does not only take place in london but occurs in many parts of the country <e> <s> that is important <e> <s> womens groups in various cities have all kinds of committees to try to prevent rape and they have listed many points <e> <s> one of the matters about which they are very concerned is the poor street lighting because of the cutback in government and local authority expenditure <e> <s> repairs are not taking place and lighting is getting very much worse which obviously leaves many dark places which people must walk through even on main streets <e> <s> those are the kinds of matters to which women are drawing the attention of the local police forces <e> <s> will the minister make sure that all those points are considered <e>", "<cs> my lords the point that the noble baroness is making is a very important one because most of the people who are concerned are those who are living in rooms or various types of accommodation and are more often than not those people <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware we know very well that he is aware that many of the persons concerned are those who are in the lower income brackets and therefore have little redress when they appeal directly to the landlord for any help <e> <s> it is important that those persons about whom the noble baroness has spoken should be protected <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister satisfied with those results <e> <s> is the minister aware that there is a slight worry that perhaps the idea of the exercise not only was to offer job opportunities to people but was a back-door method of finding out whether people were genuinely unemployed <e>", "<cs> my lords one has to say that the noble lord has this afternoon given us what he thinks are good results he gave us the figures <e> <s> does he accept that these good results should now be showing in the inner cities particularly those with the greatest unemployment such as the west midlands <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness inform us whether any women have been included among the list of chairmen who have been appointed <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord talks about helping the ethnic minorities and then he quotes the two-year training course but is he <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i am involved in the city of birmingham <e> <s> i know the handsworth project <e> <s> i know the area well and i take what he has said as a slight on what i am trying to do in my small way <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord stallard has clearly spelt out to the house that a caring society must face the issues that he outlined tonight and that some solutions must be found in the immediate future <e> <s> those among us who are not able entirely to care for ourselves have a right to humane care and a reasonable quality of life <e>", "<cs> my lords it is important that the noble baroness puts in the word blind so that this may appear in <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness give us some reasons as to why we have to wait months for the final report <e>", "<cs> my lords for the benefit of the house can the noble baroness tell us what coma is <e>", "<cs> my lords this afternoon many noble lords have spoken about heathrow gatwick and stansted but i shall be concentrating my remarks on birmingham airport <e> <s> that is my particular interest on which i shall be speaking in the few minutes at my disposal <e> <s> i want to reiterate that to a great extent the impact of the west midlands depends upon the airport <e> <s> it is an important gateway into the conurbation it is at the centre of the country and it therefore offers facilities for economic regeneration in the west midlands which is urgently needed in view of the high unemployment figures throughout the whole region <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that birmingham education committee and birmingham social services are pioneering a scheme for those particular children <e> <s> an advertisement for a director was placed last weekend <e> <s> the funding of that centre will be by birmingham city council dr barnardos the parkinsons disease society and the percy bilton fund <e> <s> that scheme is to be evaluated by nottingham university <e> <s> is the minister aware of that project and will he see that some resource is sent there if at all possible especially in respect of the evaluation of that project <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that birmingham city council is pioneering the scheme and not birmingham university <e> <s> it all arose through one of the children in the city who is now in budapest <e> <s> the city itself felt after visiting the centre that it was a useful exercise as the noble earl has said to see whether the scheme could be put into operation and then evaluated <e> <s> however it is not a university scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to compliment he noble lord lord wells-pestell on giving us the opportunity to debate this important matter <e> <s> although we have bandied around figures statistics and percentages all the comparisons that have been made are about people <e> <s> that is the important factor that we must remember in a debate of this description <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness gave us a figure for <e> <s> can she give us more up-to-date information on when she feels there will be a settlement of this injustice <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness also agree that the voluntary agencies have gained considerably from the original support for band aid which the general public took to their hearts and to which they gave thousands and thousands of pounds <e> <s> is she aware that this week-end the sports aid programme is to take place throughout the world sponsored by sportsmen from all over the world <e>", "<cs> i am not intending to speak about birmingham airport <e> <s> i have however been approached by humberside which is in a very difficult position <e> <s> humberside has tried to expand <e> <s> to a certain extent this expansion depends upon the servicing of helicopters and aircraft flying back and forth to north sea rigs

this is a considerable amount when one takes account of the size of the airport <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble earl why the local authorities are in a different category from the british airports authority <e> <s> stansted is a developing airport in the same way as are the local authority airports <e> <s> however there is a different way of dealing with the debts of the british airport authority <e> <s> the debts will go back to the airport authorities under the plcs and they will be repaid to the government as and when the dates for repayment are decided <e> <s> why is there a difference because it is a local authority airport as distinct from a national airport which is the taxpayers airport at present under the british airports authority <e> <s> the others are local authority airports which in the main involve part local authority money and part government money but why should there be this difference in how the debt repayments have to be made <e> <s> i cannot see why the government make these distinctions when it is either taxpayers money or taxpayers and ratepayers money <e>", "<cs> i was not wrong in my assumption <e> <s> i understood clearly that the debt is going <e>", "<cs> i should like to emphasise paragraph <e>", "<cs> the smell of gas escaping in ronan point must have been in several flats <e> <s> one presumes that it would have taken much longer than half an hour to find where it was escaping and where it was to be turned off <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already spoken to the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes to say that i was going to intervene <e> <s> it will not be at great length <e> <s> i too welcome the bill <e> <s> i just want to draw attention to the powers that will be given to the customs and excise officers at ports of entry to disclose information <e> <s> presumably the disclosure of the information will be to the trading standards officers in the area <e> <s> therefore i can see that there is going to be a great need for a closer working relationship between the customs and excise and the trading standards officers or the duly authorised people if they do not have trading standards officers who are in the areas where goods are being brought into the country <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister recall that the prime minister herself went to the united states spoke on television and appealed to american tourists not to cancel their bookings saying that britain is a much safer place than new york <e> <s> was she not so concerned about the loss of revenue to the tourist industry

"<cs> the difficulty here is about what we call consultation <e> <s> the consultation procedure is normally the giving of information <e> <s> therefore consultation has to take place before any plans are on the table <e> <s> in other words the tenants themselves should be informed that it is envisaged that a block of flats or an area is going to change ownership from the local authority <e> <s> the consultation procedure normally is comprised of somebody coming along with a big plan and saying we have a building society and a private trust and this is what we are going to do <e> <s> the tenants are then faced with that or nothing <e> <s> obviously if it is that or nothing and they are thinking about their home and the roof above them they will take that <e> <s> the opportunities to discuss other ways in which the local authority could be helped to use the properties in a different way are not a part of the procedure <e> <s> we have to ask what is consultation <e> <s> it should not be just a passing of information to a group of people who say yes or no to whether or not they agree to it <e>", "<cs> so the first consultation will be that the secretary of state will agree to what one would call a bald statement do you wish your properties to be taken out of council ownership and put into private ownership <e> <s> answer yes or no <e> <s> is that what the noble lord is trying to say <e>", "<cs> do i understand from what the noble lord just said that the first consultation if we can call it a consultation will be that the local authority says to the group of tenants we intend in the future to consider the selling-off of your properties and the land thereon to someone else <e> <s> do you wish to retain council ownership of the area or are you willing to be passed over to private developers <e> <s> answer yes or no <e> <s> is that what the minister means by the first consultation <e>", "<cs> as i understand the amendment of my noble freind lady nicol and the observations that the noble lord has just made i presume that the bill gives the secretary of state for <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a little worrying when the minister gives us the kind of reply that he has given this afternoon <e> <s> when one sees television and reads the newspapers as well as all the material that is issued by various organisations including the cbi the building trade and all kinds of bodies it is worrying to hear the noble lord say that there is sufficient money or that there ought to be sufficient money because of what the government are doing to provide housing for those people who have no alternative but to live in rented accommodation <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that there are two points which it is important for us to stress <e> <s> so easily these matters take on a legal aspect <e> <s> i think that we have all listened quite adequately to the discussion of points that could arise if litigation should take place and lawyers are brought in but i think that what my noble friend was saying was that these are people who at the present moment are living or will be living in rented flats or houses in the main <e> <s> all that is asked is that they should have the opportunity of deciding their fate <e>", "<cs> my lords i come from the city of birmingham and my title baroness fisher of rednal incorporates the large leyland works at longbridge <e>

taken unemployment they have taken redundancy they have slimmed down and now there is what is called an efficient workforce <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness tell us how local authorities

existing legislation consumer rights in relation to defective products can be exercised only against the seller of the goods <e> <s> there is no right of action at present against the manufacturer or

one spent the money <e> <s> that meant that one had to understand about rate support grants and about all the other grants that the local authority received <e> <s> after years and having been chairman of the housing committee during that time i think i left the local authority with a rather clear understanding of how the rate support grant worked and how all the various components worked

disappointed with the reply <e> <s> if i am right i am grateful to the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask one question <e> <s> i do not

lords with the leave of the house will the minister answer the question i posed to him <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord skelmersdale began by saying that the bill was to put past practice on a

it is unfortunate that the government have had this great need to keep on changing the grant formula <e> <s> the constant changes which are taking place make it extremely difficult for local authorities to plan their services <e> <s> as the noble lord said he does not have a crystal ball so he cannot say what will happen in the future <e> <s> all we have to do is hope that for a period of

unemployment that will arise from those departments which close down <e> <s> in those circumstances do the employees get redundancy pay and their subsequent pension <e>", "<cs> i support the observations of my noble friend lord graham and the right reverend prelate the bishop of sheffield <e> <s> i agree with the noble baronesses lady carnegy of lour and lady blatch that training is essential for job regeneration in the inner cities <e> <s> this is taking place in various schemes small schemes in the main for the regeneration of urban areas and the rebuilding of substandard

just given to my noble friend <e> <s> the handsworth inner-city taskforce is the taskforce which was referred to by my noble friend <e> <s> it is part local authority and part government <e> <s> it

privatising the services of the local authority by putting them out to contract call it what you will that taking them away from local government control can prove detrimental to the employees who are

on the assessment did i hear somebody say no <e> <s> i thought we were still in a free country and in this free chamber <e>", "<cs> i think the debate which has taken place this afternoon and this evening has been most interesting interesting primarily because we have had such a large contribution from ex-members of her majestys government and the different points of view which have been expressed by them are proving most useful <e> <s> they were both interesting and useful because in the main they were <e>", "<cs> i shall be quite brief <e> <s> it upsets me intensely to hear somebody

such as not having playing fields might make a school one that is not readily accepted but it is quite wrong for us to designate schools as bad schools because many of the schools that are under extreme difficulties have staff that are very very dedicated to try to help in those areas <e>", "<cs> can the noble baroness tell us how this affects schools with falling numbers <e> <s> in them the local authorities are having to use their best knowledge considering the finance of keeping certain schools open and of closing others for a variety of reasons <e> <s> what happens under this

has got rid of its temporary buildings and therefore its figures now are not the figures that it would have been admitting in <e> <s> the local authority has decided that there is provision in other schools and the temporary buildings have been pulled down <e> <s> am i correct in thinking that the noble baroness said that if a school wished to go back to the figure it could ask the secretary of state to reconsider the matter so that provision could be made <e>", "<cs> is that cost effective <e> <s> if there are already places for pupils in a school and that school has got rid of its temporary buildings surely it is a waste of public money to rebuild when there are places available in other schools simply because the arbitrary figure of is used <e>", "<cs> for a period of nine years i was chairman of special schools in birmingham and therefore i have quite a large knowledge of special schools <e> <s> i do not know any other part of the country but i would have said that the special schools in birmingham were providing an excellent service for children who would not get that kind of education if it was not provided by the local authority <e> <s> therefore it worries me

government are becoming terribly muddled with the various pieces of legislation that they are bringing forward <e> <s> they are not considering the overlap between one department and another <e> <s> the noble lords intervention bears that out <e> <s> i hope that when the minister replies he will give us some good news on this important matter so that at last these benches will obtain some concession on this bill <e>", "<cs> on the general point of clause many people who are being cared for in the community are getting respite care <e> <s> two people whom i visit spend six weeks at home

very little time to do so if all the procedures we have been talking about for the past minutes are not in their hands by the end of next year <e>", "<cs> what the noble earl said is somewhat worrying

waste of public expenditure <e> <s> this hostel takes in these tramps only during the night and the police will be bringing them in at various times <e> <s> however as my noble friend said they have to leave the hostel at eight oclock the next morning <e> <s> one does not know where they go during the day but if they are found drunk again on the succeeding night they will be brought back in <e>

happening <e> <s> however he continued by saying that most likely the husband would pay both of the charges <e> <s> therefore we come to the whole basis of the bill which is the question of accountability <e>", "<cs> she will be receiving a bill but she will not be paying it <e>", "<cs> yes the noble earl said earnings <e>", "<cs> the information which has come from the government expresses a point of view on that matter <e> <s> that is the information contained in the document from the department of the environment welsh office <e> <s> a few people have two or more homes or

mentioned on page line <e> <s> i wondered whether i was on the right page <e>", "<cs> i wanted to speak on the attachment of earnings <e> <s> as a magistrate one has to recognise that some fines and

i started speaking because that point came under a particular paragraph but i am quite willing to agree to that procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give the house information as to the level of the salary scale at which the licensed teachers will be joining the profession before the two years training and afterwards <e> <s> at what level of the salary scale will they be placed <e>", "<cs> i shall not be speaking at great length <e> <s> however i wish to reiterate the point that the noble lord lord carr and the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes raised that the situation does not affect only westminster <e> <s> one has heard a lot about westminster and birmingham has been mentioned <e> <s> birmingham has not only a large day-time population but also a large night-time population who come to listen to the city of birmingham orchestra to see the ballet from london and to hear the opera that comes from london twice a year <e> <s> the provisions will not affect only a few thousand people <e> <s> there are over million people living in the city of birmingham <e> <s> therefore a much greater number of persons is involved in this discussion <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness lady seear has asked the minister two questions <e> <s> i was interested to hear the minister say that there would be fewer indicators of need <e> <s> that phrase worried me more than any other <e> <s> i followed what the minister said but i had thought that the need element for local authorities meant just that need for the needy authorities <e> <s> i believe all members will agree that some authorities have more severe problems than others <e> <s> one does not wish to enumerate them because those members present know the difficulties faced by some local authorities <e> <s> will the fewer indicators of need operate against those local authorities which need the money particularly the inner city areas throughout the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment mainly because such preparation is going on within the maintained school sector <e> <s> i come from birmingham where there is a large ethnic minority component in the schools and where in some schools the overwhelming majority of pupils are from the ethnic minorities <e> <s> for that reason the schools are facing up to the need to spread multi-cultural activities <e> <s> these start more often than not with music dance and art in schools <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give us a report of the last meeting that he had with the trading standards officers regarding this whole question of car servicing and the selling of vehicles which are in an unroadworthy condition <e> <s> the powers of trading standards officers are very limited because the main ones lie with the police force <e> <s> but will the minister be able to report at some future date further consultations with trading standards officers in order to overcome the very bad service that a great majority of motorists receive <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give an assurance that the houses of parliament are inspected every months in the way he has indicated <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness perhaps give me an answer to a question <e> <s> i think i understood her to say that the testing will be given weighting for the physically handicapped but not for the mentally handicapped <e> <s> i may have been quite wrong in taking that point up but i am concerned that those children who are in the integrated groups going through the primary schools will have some kind of consideration given to them because they have special needs which are not physical needs <e>", "<cs> this is a point of order <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> a great deal of my services on the birmingham city council were specifically connected with special education <e> <s> i agree that the act made certain recommendations <e> <s> the forward-looking authorities have put many of those recommendations into operation <e> <s> however i believe that the act failed to legislate for education for post year-olds <e> <s> throughout the country many post year-olds have been deprived of that education <e> <s> therefore the act only extended education to the age of <e> <s> there was no further provision for special education <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble baroness can tell the house whether what she has just referred to is contained in the consultation documents or has it been printed in <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down perhaps she can answer a specific question <e> <s> if a teacher is being transferred to another school and if the conditions being offered to the teacher are different to those of the previous school will the salary be protected <e> <s> in other words a teacher who may be on one grade at one school is transferred to a different school which is willing to receive him <e> <s> will the salary be protected <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may follow on what the noble baroness lady young has said <e> <s> many schools especially the larger ones offer excellent facilities not only to the pupils but to the neighbouring general community in the use of sports halls swimming baths committee rooms and so on which thus have a joint use <e> <s> if a school decided to opt out would such facilities continue to be used by the general public or would there be a separation <e> <s> would there be any loss of availability for general use <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support the amendment and also the remarks of my noble friend lord dormand <e> <s> it is not only parents of children in grant-maintained schools who desire nursery education for their children <e> <s> more nursery provision is necessary in many parts of the inner cities <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support my noble friend <e> <s> there is a point that one has to consider <e> <s> very often a son or daughter will have been living at home <e> <s> first the mother dies <e> <s> then the father dies <e> <s> this person will have been caring for an elderly parent for a considerable number of years <e> <s> he or she may have given up many opportunities of working and have become a full-time carer for his or her elderly parents <e> <s> does that mean that on the death of the last parent there will be no chance of succession for that person <e> <s> he or she will have saved the local authority or hospital service or whatever it may be a great deal of money by caring voluntarily for parents in the proper way that we all like to think children do <e> <s> we should like to understand that such people will have a succession to the tenancy after such service <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not be following up the remarks of the previous speaker in my observations because my experience covers perhaps a much wider area than the housing situation which exists in westminster <e> <s> as my noble friend lord dean mentioned for a considerable time i was the chairman of the birmingham housing committee <e> <s> the minister will know without my telling him that birmingham has the largest number of local authority houses in the country <e>", "<cs> and of course my lords age concern are very concerned about abstentions and say <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend <e> <s> my lords perhaps i may also echo the point to which the noble lord lord goodman referred when talking about anxiety concern and worry <e> <s> i am not talking here of something i do not know <e> <s> two weeks ago the councillors of a local authority outside birmingham had arranged meetings on two of their small housing estates to explain the housing bill to them <e> <s> local authorities cannot advertise any more <e> <s> therefore the councillors are having to do the job on the floor of meetings <e> <s> i was invited to sit and listen <e> <s> the worry <e> <s> concern and anxiety were awful <e> <s> there were approximately tenants at the one meeting and over at the other <e> <s> the concern was manifest among all the people there <e> <s> they asked <e> <s> what does an assured tenancy mean <e> <s> what does a short hold tenancy mean <e> <s> these people are not politicians <e> <s> they are not people who normally go to meetings <e> <s> they went to a meeting because it concerned their homes <e> <s> they were worried that something might happen to them and that they would not be able to return to them <e> <s> they asked such questions as what does it mean that we are protected under the rent act <e> <s> one lady asked will you send us a card to tell us where the voting place is and where we have to use our votes <e> <s> these people are anxious because they do not know what will happen <e> <s> they do not know when they will vote <e> <s> they are even frightened of being ill in hospital and of losing their vote <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble baroness lady faithful <e> <s> the information she talks about is highly confidential <e> <s> therefore the smallest leak could have quite dire effects in some instances <e> <s> i thought she put the case very well indeed <e> <s> i should like to back up the final point she made namely that the british association of social workers should have the opportunity perhaps when the regulations are being drawn up to make sure that in the regulations the points of view which have been expressed by her are well understood <e>", "<cs> my lords i mentioned at earlier stages of the bill two charities which i know very well in the birmingham area <e> <s> the observations that the minister has just made are very welcome and will be of fundamental importance to the charities that are doing such good work for such a very deprived group of people men in the main in the community <e> <s> on behalf of the two charities that i have mentioned and those that other noble lords have mentioned i say thank you to the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords as a magistrate i feel that not many people will be sent to prison by the magistrates courts in birmingham <e> <s> we are constantly told to use every measure short of sending people to prison <e> <s> we are told that the home office does not want any more people in prison <e> <s> additionally when people come before a court for not paying for all kinds of things we ask what they can pay and take the least amount <e> <s> they may say we can pay p a week and to avoid sending them to prison we accept that <e> <s> it saves money in the long run <e> <s> building societies do not attempt to put people in prison for not paying their mortgages and credit card companies do not attempt it either <e> <s> it seems strange that the government who maintain that prisons are overcrowded should make such regulations under the bill <e>", "<cs> the clause attempts to create assured tenancies and assured shorthold tenancies <e> <s> in the long run that will be done at the expense of tenants with either protected tenancies in the private sector or secure tenancies in the local authority sector <e> <s> the government wish to see that change in tenancy <e> <s> therefore the change will also mean a change in security <e> <s> it is obvious that the government hope that new rent levels will be brought in <e> <s> market rents are mentioned frequently in the bill <e>", "<cs> can the minister give me an interpretation <e> <s> i am thinking of when a marriage breaks down and under the matrimonial causes act and the family reform act the wife is left to stay as the tenant <e> <s> i may be wrong but it looks as <e>", "<cs> i accept what the noble earl said regarding divorce but there are many couples where the marriage breaks up and no divorce takes place <e> <s> i believe the noble earl said that the non-tenant spouse has no right to appeal to the rent assessment committee <e> <s> if she can find a husband to pay the extra rent she will be all right <e> <s> we know that a great number of marriages break down and the husbands disappear altogether <e> <s> it is the fact that a rent might be increased and the non-tenant spouse cannot apply to the rent assessment committee <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord go a little further <e> <s> i am thinking now of council houses which might be sold <e> <s> i could describe many houses in the city of birmingham there might be or houses in little closes with very nice grass and trees provided by the local authority <e> <s> some have quite big areas of green <e> <s> i know many local authorities have done this so that especially where there are blocks of flats there is green open space <e> <s> how would that be affected under the noble lords amendment <e> <s> i should not like to feel that there was no protection for those areas <e> <s> even if the blocks of flats or the surrounding houses were sold to a private landlord i should like to feel that the open space development would be retained <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble lord one question <e> <s> it is very interesting to hear that the man continues to make maintenance payments <e> <s> however i sit in the matrimonial courts in birmingham and in fact that does not happen at all <e> <s> the husband leaves and the woman is left high and dry and more often than not the first thing that she has to do is to go straight down to the social security offices to make quite sure that she receives some payment <e> <s> it normally takes that office between three and four weeks to make quite sure that the husband has not returned or is not coming into the house and giving her some money and so on <e>", "<cs> i wish to support my noble friend lord stallard regarding premiums <e> <s> that money will be difficult to find especially for those whom the government have said they wish to help rehouse <e> <s> the situation will be particularly difficult in london <e>", "<cs> it is not strictly related to what my noble friend said but yesterday the noble earl lord caithness said <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for that reply which i find very difficult to accept <e> <s> i telephoned the housing corporation this morning after i had contacted my housing association <e> <s> i received the advice from the housing corporation <e> <s> i was given the reply which i gave to the minister that it would be a matter of discipline by the corporation if any housing associations were found doing this <e> <s> if the noble lord knows of any housing associations which are charging premiums to tenants i think that is important <e> <s> i received the answer from the housing corporation at about a quarter-to this morning <e>", "<cs> can the minister give the committee more information regarding mixed funding and the housing associations which are most likely to take it up <e> <s> as my noble friend and others have said most housing associations are small organisations which make accommodation available to meet specific needs <e> <s> one would expect that even under this bill most housing associations catering for such needs will not want to expand to become large housing associations <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may turn to clause which defines the way in which one has to designate an area <e> <s> in clause b c and d we see quite clearly the physical considerations the way in which the local authority manage the housing and the living conditions of those who live in the area <e> <s> i do not know very much about london local authorities or many local authorities apart from the west midlands <e> <s> i know a lot about the sandwell local authority because it is adjacent to the city of birmingham <e> <s> i hope that the minister knows that part of the sandwell local authority is in the black country re-development scheme <e> <s> it is an area that has suffered a great deal through the closure of the steel and iron works in the black country <e> <s> however in spite of that it has a well run local authority and one that is very well thought of by the residents in that area <e>", "<cs> i am sure that if i ask sandwell local authority it will send copies <e> <s> perhaps i may send a copy to the noble lord himself <e> <s> if i have done wrong in showing the pictures <e>", "<cs> i think that the minister looked at them with interest <e> <s> in this action area there is a part ii sheltered accommodation for the elderly which contains three well-designed warden service flats <e> <s> it also has another bungalows for the elderly <e> <s> in the autumn a hostel is being erected which is funded by mencap <e> <s> further warden service housing is being carried out by a housing association <e> <s> it completely refurbished a large block of flats for homeless young people which will have a full-time warden and a closed entry <e> <s> that is being tenanted at the present moment <e> <s> the whole of the ground floor is being given over to services for advice which the young people will require <e>", "<cs> i was interested to hear the minister give a list of the languages which were made available <e> <s> how did the people who were distributing them know which language the people would want <e>", "<cs> with due respect to the noble earl the copy which i have is the english copy and there is nothing on the back of it in any other language <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down can he clarify a point concerning the letter that he has which was sent to the tenants and the letter i have which was sent to the tenants <e> <s> the letter i have has on the top of it the address <e>", "<cs> there is nothing in my copy of the letter which was delivered to all the people in sandwell about any other language <e> <s> i could not raise this matter when the noble earl replied to me earlier because i had given my copy of the letter to <e>", "<cs> i entirely accept what the minister has said <e> <s> there is a note at the bottom of the secretary of states letter which tells them where to apply for further information <e> <s> the letter is not as the noble earl said distributed in the various languages <e> <s> the letter says at the bottom that if you want further information you should write to the address given <e> <s> they then send you the little leaflet <e> <s> i wrote myself and said that i wanted the leaflet which they sent me <e> <s> however that is not distributed unless it is asked for <e> <s> the letter that the occupier has is only in english <e> <s> it says in the notes on clauses that the secretary of state will as a first step send dear occupier letters to all those living in the area <e> <s> this letter offers a leaflet explaining the proposals which will be in the five languages <e>", "<cs> i should like to expand on one or two of the points made by my noble friend lord stallard <e> <s> schedule outlines the constitution of the housing action trusts <e> <s> these will be like mini local authorities but without democracy built into them <e> <s> they will have a chairman and a deputy chairman and those who serve on them will be paid <e> <s> they will be almost like new town development corporations <e> <s> they will be able to act without consulting the tenants as the constitution of the trusts does not say that they must consult <e>", "<cs> does the noble earl agree that if a group of persons living in the area did their own canvassing it might be the tenants themselves who went around having formed their committee and canvassed to get their own conclusions the result might be not to go to a private landlord <e> <s> would that be equal to what the electoral reform society would be doing <e> <s> it is important that both sides should have the option of voting on the basis of the way in which the case is presented to them <e> <s> in the same way in any election the conservatives the liberals and the labour party come knocking on the door and one makes a choice afterwards <e> <s> although it is important that the government will be setting up schemes in the new year to fund groups that will be putting over the case for the landlord it is also important that the tenants should be able to carry out their own ballot and to present that as their findings <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the noble earl has answered many of the points made by my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> the people about whom we are speaking are the homeless they are registered on a local authoritys housing list and all local authorities have waiting lists <e> <s> the latest publication of the adc shows increasing numbers on their housing lists because of the housing for sale policy through which many people in the villages have lost their houses <e> <s> the adc is also bringing forward from the districts the problem of homelessness <e> <s> those of us who have lived in large cities are not exactly used to homelessness but are aware that it has been a problem for a long time <e> <s> homelessness however is now being felt all over the country and as the noble lord lord ross so clearly spelt out what we want is more houses <e> <s> we do not want simply to juggle landlords about whether councils private landlords or whatever <e> <s> that will not solve the problem of homelessness <e> <s> it will not solve the problem that there are not enough properties to go around <e> <s> if there were people would be living in those properties <e> <s> i hope that the minister does not give us the number of council properties that are empty <e> <s> the figures have been published <e> <s> the largest <e>", "<cs> will the minister please explain why he said that the secretary of state may make regulations <e> <s> i understand that he is now going to say shall <e> <s> the noble earl explained during a previous debate on ballots that at present some regulations are being seriously considered <e> <s> i wonder whether he can give us some idea of what those regulations may be as he has done with regard to the opting-out procedure <e> <s> this is almost in the same category as opting out <e> <s> as the noble earl said there is a misunderstanding in that people feel they have got to vote <e> <s> will there be any different regulations as distinct from the opting-out regulations where they definitely have to say no <e>", "<cs> will the minister explain to those of us including myself who are not lawyers estate agents or chartered surveyors what fee simple estate means <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment which has been so ably moved by my noble friend <e> <s> however i should like to ensure that <e>", "<cs> i am very disappointed by the ministers reply <e> <s> those about whom i spoke the elderly and the disabled are not the people who will exploit the bill <e> <s> members of the committee will remember that i specifically spoke about the disabled and elderly who are living in accommodation which is now unfortunately too large for them <e> <s> this may be for many reasons families may have left home or father and mother have died and the disabled son or daughter is left <e> <s> rather than exploiting the system they are the people who need help from the system whether in the form of housing benefit or attendance allowances <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble earl will bear in mind the fact that there are people who receive excessive amounts of income tax relief because they live in houses which are very much larger than they really need <e> <s> they receive benefit from the public purse which is not given to those who really need it <e> <s> tax relief on mortgages often goes to people who live in very large houses <e> <s> on the one hand one can argue that people are forced to live in large properties because there is nowhere else for them to go perhaps because they are sick or disabled <e> <s> when looking at housing in the future on a global basis perhaps the ministers argument should be considered in relation to the special rebates granted through the tax system to those who are better off and living in premises which are much larger than they need and those people should be equated with those at the lower end of the scale <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may support my noble friend <e> <s> as a magistrate sitting in the domestic courts i find some of the problems which the noble lord has enumerated so very well from these benches <e> <s> whether one calls them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a little worried and i am not a council tenant <e> <s> i do not think that the ministers remarks have clarified the position in a way that the tenant will understand <e> <s> perhaps in the regulations or in the discussions which are now taking place with the housing corporation the minister will give more explicit details <e> <s> however the voting system can become almost a charade because of the misconceptions <e>", "<cs> my lords i too have been concerned about the matter that my noble friend raises <e> <s> is the minister aware that all kinds of people are going round council houses as prospective landlords and harassing tenants <e> <s> on an estate that i know all the tenants have notices in their windows saying nobody is to call here about buying the property <e> <s> i understand that to be the point of my noble friend <e> <s> these callers are already on the doorstep trying to get their message over <e> <s> does the housing corporation know that <e> <s> if so it should be doing something about it <e> <s> this is contrary to what the government wish <e> <s> it is going on <e> <s> i am sure that the minister would condemn it <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down can he say what qualifications are needed to be a teller <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down again i should like to ask another question <e> <s> suppose i were a very good headmistress who had just retired and who joined up with two male colleagues and we believed that we were competent to be tellers <e> <s> could we apply to the housing corporation to become tellers <e> <s> with a very good background and an understanding of the requirements would we be allowed to act as tellers <e> <s> i should like to know who the tellers will be <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment moved by my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> we also have to consider how it reflects upon the local authority <e> <s> already local authorities are having new claimants put on housing benefit for when boarders are being transferred from next april <e> <s> that is another category of people they have to start dealing with <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not understand what the minister said in regard to appeals <e> <s> he seemed to say i may be wrong that the local authority will be able to appeal to some senior rent officers <e> <s> i want to know what the tenant can do <e> <s> one has to accept that the tenant has a certain responsibility and should be able to appeal <e> <s> i do not mind if this goes to a second higher place for appeal <e>", "<cs> the noble earls adviser is saying no <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the noble countess lady mar and want to highlight a charity with which i am involved in the city of birmingham which feels aggrieved

st <e> <s> basils are unqualified and inexperienced in employment and training terms <e> <s> most of them arrive at st <e> <s> basils as a result of problems in the family <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord seebohm moved the amendment in a manner which was easily understood by us all <e> <s> what worries me more than anything is the fact that conservative members of the house do not realise that we are talking about peoples homes <e> <s> in their view they may be humble homes but they are their homes <e> <s> at present they are terribly worried about what will happen <e> <s> as the noble lord from the cross-benches said in a rather nice phrase we should be thinking deeply about our weaker brethren <e> <s> let us have a little humanity <e> <s> let us have a little of the christianity that was used in the education bill <e> <s> let us remember that we are talking about peoples homes <e> <s> they are of the most importance to the majority of the people of whom we are talking this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl tell the house what reduction in empty properties in the ownership of various government departments has taken place <e> <s> those properties far exceed the number of empty houses that are held by local authorities <e> <s> does the minister recall that the last time we raised the issue of homelessness he said that he would look into the number of properties held by various government departments <e> <s> will he give us some information this afternoon and not keep comparing figures with the few empty properties that are held by local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords according to the latest figures from the doe since this government took control the number of homeless people has doubled <e> <s> does the minister agree that one cannot put all the blame on the shoulders of local authorities <e> <s> if one looks at the statistics of local authority spending on housing one sees that every year the figures have gone down and down because of the lack of government subsidies on new build <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that the market is subject to supply and demand <e> <s> because the demand for eggs has fallen as a result of the recent scare would it not be better for egg producers to reduce the price in line with the suggestion of the noble lord who put down the question <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl say whether schoolgirls from the age of years upwards are still included in the rubella vaccine treatment which has been prevalent in schools or whether it has been discontinued under the new scheme <e> <s> if it has been discontinued it will have a tragic effect because it concerns the overall health of teenage girls in schools <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for that most pleasing reply <e> <s> however can he tell his noble friend that there is a grave urgency to deal with the serious problem of what has become a standard joke the holes in the road <e> <s> further is he aware that excavations in the highway are not only a source of damage to vehicles but are also a constant problem for the elderly the disabled and mothers with prams and pushchairs <e> <s> will he also draw those points to the ministers attention <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> will he ask his noble friend to consider selling the number plates that are held at swansea to charitable organisations <e> <s> in other words <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disappointed with that reply <e> <s> one reads and is constantly told that the countrys economy is raring away <e> <s> we have billions to pay off the national debt <e> <s> is it not possible for the minister to put it quite seriously to his honourable friend that the treasury instead of clawing everything back could use the funds to help the disabled <e> <s> one would have thought that this tory government would have considered the caring aspect of getting rid of these number plates <e>", "<cs> my lords when does the minister expect to give the house the number of starts under the hats scheme which the government are promoting <e> <s> will he give us the date when they are starting in the london boroughs in <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the minister one question <e> <s> it relates to a case in which a person is sentenced to a period of imprisonment <e> <s> he may be sentenced to three four or five years but he does not normally serve that long <e> <s> does the ban relate to the period that is given in the sentence in court or to the date when he is released early from prison <e>", "<cs> my lords throughout the th century and early th century local authority water engineers gradually assumed greater responsibility for the water cycle <e> <s> it was they who established the water supply and sewerage service that has for so long been taken for granted <e> <s> there is continuing controversy over the governments plans for water privatisation <e> <s> that controversy is the growing argument that the government do not even own the assets which they are planning to sell <e> <s> the bill brought forward by the minister provides for the transfer of property rights and assets of water authorities to successor water and sewerage companies <e> <s> the key question asked by various noble lords is can they transfer those rights and assets if

the war will see that there is an urgent need to spend money on repairs to put them back into use <e> <s> if the government continue to cut back on local authority finance for housing local authorities will never build more houses and will never be able to make repairs <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend answers again we are in a different ball game since the government have been asking for compulsory competitive tenders <e> <s> that means that the chief officer whoever he is has the greatest difficulty in seeing that tenders are being carried out to the specifications once they have been accepted <e> <s> nobody is travelling around to see if the lawns have been cut every week as should have been done according to the tender <e> <s> that is an important aspect as the government have insisted on compulsory tendering <e> <s> somebody from the local authority must see that the money is being well spent otherwise the elected local members can be accused of wasting ratepayers money when it might not be their fault because the tender has gone out <e> <s> for example there is the recent example of the tender across the road in st james park where the deckchair tender having been given out now with all the hot sunny weather only one-third of the deckchairs are available because the man who was given the tender has disappeared <e> <s> how does the chief executive know that the people who have the tender are still doing the work <e> <s> that is another problem to be solved <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord explain the duties of the monitoring officer <e> <s> it is a new nomenclature in local government <e> <s> however if i am incorrect in that i apologise to members of the committee <e> <s> this monitoring officer reminds me very much of the housing corporation and its monitoring officers <e> <s> it is a title which the corporation uses <e> <s> in that case the idea of a monitoring officer is that he visits each of the housing associations once a year twice a year if he is not a very capable officer a report is made and a rating of a b c or d is given <e> <s> if many d-ratings are received another monitoring must be carried out <e>", "<cs> before the minister answers perhaps he can tell me whether or not sections and of the disabled persons employment act include those people with a sensory handicap that is people who might be blind or partially sighted or who are suffering from deafness <e>", "<cs> can the minister reply to my question <e>", "<cs> i have a similar question <e> <s> later in the bill we shall come to the housing action trusts <e> <s> we understand that tenants will be able to keep a secure tenancy in a housing action trust <e> <s> what will happen to people in housing action trusts if there is not a housing revenue account <e>", "<cs> it all comes out of the housing revenue account <e> <s> what a local authority does with public housing comes out of the housing revenue account <e> <s> i was chairman of a local authority for a long time so i know how the accounts are drawn up <e> <s> the housing revenue account is related to the council twice a year <e> <s> the money must come from somewhere <e> <s> it comes from rents from selling off properties and from government subsidies but it makes up an account in a local authority <e>", "<cs> will the noble earl give serious consideration to street lighting <e> <s> many of the more recent developments in local authority housing are not constructed along the lines of streets or roads but in closes so that one has to walk through them in order to get from one place to another <e> <s> therefore the street lamps must be set much closer together than the authorised number of yards that is the case on public roads <e> <s> that factor is extremely important in these new developments where greenery in the form of bushes and other vegetation is being established <e> <s> if less provision is made for lighting in the future because it does not come out of the housing account i feel women and children who have to walk through such areas during periods of darkness may face more danger <e>", "<cs> we know what the private landlord ultimately does when he cannot obtain the rent <e> <s> he evicts <e> <s> therefore it becomes the responsibility of the local authority to rehouse <e> <s> the local authority with tenants with rent arrears is in a very difficult position <e> <s> it knows very well that it has nowhere to turn them out to <e> <s> if it evicts them and takes them through the court they are homeless <e> <s> they therefore have to come back again into local authority properties <e>", "<cs> can the minister tell the house how one can pass on from the private landlord the cost of arrears when fair rents are fixed on properties <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to what the minister said <e> <s> the large local authorities have been capitalising <e> <s> that is obvious because a tremendous amount of repair work needs to be done to keep up the standard of those properties in occupation <e> <s> the minister will agree that if substantial repairs are not carried out i am thinking particularly of birmingham empty properties will fall into complete decay <e> <s> the capitalisation of repairs has been going on <e> <s> do i understand that that will continue for those local authorities that have been capitalising <e> <s> we have to find some means to help other authorities that have not been able to find the necessary capital receipts to enable repairs to be done <e> <s> or does it mean that those authorities that have been spending will be prevented from spending as much as they need to spend to help out other authorities that do not have the money to spend <e>", "<cs> the minister spoke about the testing of resources <e> <s> can he tell me whether that means that everybody will have to go through the means testing procedure he has just described when so many of the people will automatically be able to put their pension books or income support books on the table <e> <s> they have already gone through a means testing procedure or whatever one likes to call it <e> <s> is it not enough that they have already gone through a government testing of resources procedure without setting up another similar test <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down can he say whether the national exhibition centre would fall within the category which he has just described <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps if he sends that information to my noble friend he will send a copy to me <e> <s> i have already mentioned the nec this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support my noble friend as regards consultation <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support my noble friend on the front bench and amplify some of the points that he made <e> <s> i am sure in my own mind that the government do not understand the housing problems that exist throughout the country <e> <s> they do not realise the difficulties faced by those people who are trying to manage local authority housing in the best way possible <e> <s> they do not see the problems of the local authorities and brush them aside by talking about the housing corporation and housing associations <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness talking about birmingham <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very interested in what the noble earl said and i understand what we mean by enabling <e> <s> however if he were the housing manager of a local authority what would he do if tomorrow morning he had homeless families outside his door and he had rung round all the housing associations in this area and they had said we are terribly sorry but we have no vacancies we have nothing <e> <s> does he compel a private landlord to have the families if he has a vacancy <e> <s> i never understand what this word enabling means in the context of housing the homeless <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i did not quite hear what the noble earl said <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know what soft landing means <e> <s> i thought it was something to do with jumping with a parachute but evidently it is not <e> <s> can the minister tell me whether soft landing means the same as affordability <e> <s> does it mean what the government suggested in the past that rent levels should be related to average earnings in any area <e> <s> what does it mean <e> <s> does it mean just an election ploy <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down i listened to him carefully but did i understand him to say that the housing associations would also receive a full subsidy for rent rebates as distinct from the local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to remind the house that in discussing this bill we have referred to what we consider in our minds to be the poll tax but what is called the community charge <e> <s> as the noble baroness lady carnegy spelled out the principle was that everyone should be liable to pay the tax <e> <s> the reason behind that principle was that every tax payer would then be able to control his or her local authority <e> <s> as noble lords on the opposite benches said we had to control the spendthrift local authorities and a community charge was brought in to do it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that my noble friend has intervened <e> <s> that was going to be my next sentence and i am not using the same brief <e> <s> it does not alter the point i am making which is that those people will be much worse off <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that these young people are facing serious problems while we are waiting for the reports <e> <s> if you have no home you have no address and so you cannot claim social security <e> <s> further if you do not have a home you cannot apply for a job <e> <s> while we are waiting for these reports young people are being left high and dry on the pavement <e>", "<cs> my lords they cannot do that if they do not live anywhere <e>", "<cs> my lords i will be brief but i want to support my noble friend <e> <s> those of us who come from large cities which have a great <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that operators who arrange holidays by air are required to licence-bond by guarantee to the civil aviation authorities <e> <s> will the minister agree that self-regulation as operated by coach operators does not give a guarantee to holidaymakers and that many find themselves stranded abroad with no means for returning home <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for those very helpful replies <e> <s> i agree that the majority of travel companies are reputable organisations <e> <s> does the minister not agree that the travelling public have a right to be protected from the cowboys in the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords in an excellent opening to the debate my noble friend lady ewart-biggs touched upon the subject of housing <e> <s> my <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> i was referring to seeing things for oneself not listening <e> <s> the very fact that one sees things for oneself is different from following them up after one has listened <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give the house information about the extra resources that are urgently needed for those people who have been discharged from mental hospitals and are now homeless and on the streets not only in london but elsewhere <e> <s> is she aware that many have been discharged from psychiatric hospitals having literally been thrown out without any resources <e> <s> will the minister look at that as a very serious problem with a view to providing resources in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell the house whether it is understood that the general practitioner who supplies a hearing aid through his own clinical diagnosis without sending the patient to the hospital will have that charge come out of his practice money <e> <s> if for one reason or another that is not possible because the general practitioner does not supply that service and the patient has to be referred to the hospital will that come out of the practice budget and will he have to pay a hospital charge for that patient <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that comprehensive reply <e> <s> but can he tell me the line her majestys government took regarding the ec directive particularly as regards liability for compensation of the whole of the package and as regards compensation protection for the contract once it is signed with the travel agent to the point of delivery <e>", "<cs> my lords i was rather disappointed with the noble lords reply to my question <e> <s> i should have thought that if he has the information before him he could stand up and give it so that the whole house will be aware of it and not just myself <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite willing to talk to the noble lord outside the chamber at the end of question time <e>", "<cs> my lords in addition to the remarks that he has just made can the minister say how many new lettings he expects to be provided as a result of these new statistics <e> <s> further can the minister say how far they go towards satisfying the demands of the homeless <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the government have an obsessional hatred of local authorities <e> <s> is he confident that the housing associations will be able to take over the role of local authorities in providing the massive number of houses that are needed not only in london and the south-east but all over the country <e> <s> is he confident that the housing corporation and the housing associations will be able to provide housing not only for the homeless but for the thousands on housing registers <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the number of people now living on income support has increased by per cent <e> <s> in the last decade <e> <s> that amounts to million people now living on income support <e> <s> how does the governments increase in spending which the minister has outlined today tie up with a per cent <e> <s> increase in need <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself following the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth and i cannot see any reasoning in his argument for not supporting the bill <e> <s> one would have thought that any bill was worth while which protects the consumer not only the person who buys the vehicle but all other road users <e> <s> we know that unsafe <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord had allowed me to continue with my speech he would have heard me say just that <e> <s> i shall repeat what i said <e> <s> trading standards officers have the power to inspect the safety of all consumer goods <e> <s> for example they can visit shops warehouses supermarkets and street markets <e> <s> they can notify the people concerned and say to them we are going to pick up these goods to test whether they are safe or dangerous <e> <s> however in their capacity as trading standards officers they cannot visit a car lot prove who they are and say i am now going to inspect that vehicle <e> <s> they simply cannot do so <e> <s> it seems strange that a consumer protection act does not allow them to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords although i read from an article i had stressed that i was not an expert in this matter <e> <s> however i presume that the people who replied to the query in the article were experts <e> <s> i personally would not recognise any marks or quivers <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister gave the number of pieces of information that would be added to the records <e> <s> however the dvlc is automatically writing off cars every year as these take place <e> <s> that must also be a costly exercise <e> <s> in addition there is the information which goes through to the computer of police records and which has constantly to be amended <e> <s> i speak as a magistrate and i am referring to motoring offences <e> <s> those records are constantly being amended and i do not know how many thousands of them must be on record at the dvlc <e> <s> there is no suggestion is there <e> <s> of the government ever saying we have too many people with motoring offences and we are not going to record them any more <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us where the family friendly crches are for employees of her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that answer <e> <s> is she aware that it is not only a london problem <e> <s> i can speak with great experience of birmingham <e> <s> do the government realise that the run-down of mental hospitals is causing a terrific financial and managerial burden on hostels that originally were meant to cater for homeless alcoholics but the same hostels are almost becoming mini-institutions catering for the former patients of psychiatric hospitals <e> <s> do not the government feel that their policy of closing down mental hospitals without adequate community services is a wrong one <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> however she will see on page of the annual report of hm inspector of schools that large numbers of pupils and students are getting a raw deal <e> <s> furthermore and sadly less able pupils and students are much more likely to experience the poor and shoddy than are the more <e>", "<cs> my lords as previous speakers have said for too long the government have complacently underestimated the damaging consequences of their failure to adopt an effective policy for the revitalisation of the british manufacturing industry <e> <s> the figures already given by noble lords prove beyond doubt the large trade gap that has arisen as a result of government policies <e> <s> if once again the country is to pay its way in the world and compete at all in europe we must adopt a coherent and effective industrial strategy for the s <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that all noble lords will have per cent <e> <s> extra time as has been given to the noble lord lord joseph <e> <s> i do not intend to dwell on the incomes of particular groups of people because although income is the main factor in determining vulnerability to poverty it is not the only one <e> <s> poverty is the combination of low income poor and often damp housing fuel poverty poor education and employment opportunities and bad health <e> <s> they all contribute to what is generally called poverty and in many cases it becomes multiple deprivation <e> <s> among those groups of people are those whom we call the vulnerable groups <e> <s> they are more often than not the elderly the unemployed the low-paid the single-parent families and the disabled <e>", "<cs> my lords what advice do the government give to school managers who refuse to take over responsibility for the buildings because they are either unsafe or in a state of dereliction <e>", "<cs> my lords what advice will the noble baroness give to local authorities when local managers say that they will not take responsibility as managers <e>", "<cs> can the noble earl comment on what is the student loans company <e> <s> according to the press today a vacancy for a general manager is being advertised with a suggested salary and a car <e> <s> two persons who will be part of that company are a senior civil servant and perhaps a lesser civil servant <e> <s> so there will be the general manager with the fantastic salary and car and two or three other people <e> <s> can the noble earl tell us what is the student loans company <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell the house what the total cost of housing benefit will be now that the government have forced local authorities to increase rents <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the house <e> <s> on the order paper my question should refer to the independent living fund and not independent living foundation <e> <s> i thank the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> but does he agree that the governments original estimate of the number of people who would claim from the fund was too low <e> <s> am i correct in thinking that the extra amount will mean that the fund will not be suspended that fresh awards will be possible and that those already receiving help will not be denied it in the future <e> <s> how long does he think the trustees will need before <e>", "<cs> my lords the beneficiaries of the fund are the severely disabled <e>", "<cs> my lords listening to noble lords this afternoon one gathers that the government appear to treat the largest infrastructure project ever undertaken in the history of this country as an ordinary commercial venture and do not seem to recognise the wider regional and national interests <e> <s> the governments view seems to be reinforced by their focusing on the implications of the channel tunnel for british rail alone <e> <s> there appear to be no avenues available for consideration by the government of any wider interests <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a little worried by the reply that the minister gave <e> <s> i am a member of a housing association <e> <s> last week we received a long letter from the director of the housing corporation on the difficulties of finance which were described as considerable <e> <s> perhaps i may read part of it <e> <s> writing to housing associations the director of the housing corporation stated <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister investigate the letter from the director of the housing corporation which has made it extremely difficult for those housing associations which had approval to carry on with their programmes only to find now they are without cash until the end of this year <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter mentioned costs <e> <s> we have to ask ourselves who is now picking up the tab and paying <e> <s> in most cases it is charities which are involved in care for the homeless young <e> <s> i speak with some experience of st <e> <s> basils in birmingham <e> <s> it is the largest charity for young people in the city and has a very extensive programme of care <e> <s> however for those charities that are specialising in care for the homeless young help is needed at the initial stages from the government <e> <s> otherwise they cannot continue with the long term rehabilitation <e> <s> it is very of ten a long process of rehabilitation <e> <s> it is not just a few chats with a welfare worker <e> <s> the costs are being met by charities in the main <e> <s> similarly when the government decided to cut back on the social fund charities were used by social services <e> <s> many organisations obtained donations to provide a gas stove or an overcoat for such people <e> <s> the charities had to pick up the tab for the cutback in the social fund <e> <s> the charities are now having to do so because they do not wish to see young people on the streets <e>", "<cs> it is always strange that people wish to know the figures <e> <s> the people who have the figures are the government <e> <s> they can collect them from social security services from charities and from other similar organisations which inform the government of their figures <e> <s> however evidently the government do not wish to add them up and to give the information <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord tell the house what activity in the building industry is concentrated on housing for local authorities and housing associations <e> <s> in other words i refer to housing that will help those he has just listed as being perhaps in the lower income groups in the community <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked the minister for details of present activity but he gave the estimate for - <e> <s> i hardly think that that is present activity <e>", "<cs> my lords unless one registers for the poll tax or community charge one cannot vote the governments argument being that as a responsible voter one can see how ones money is spent <e> <s> how does that point of view apply to the people referred to by the minister who do not pay any taxes in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to add my support to the movers of the amendment <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the very small housing associations that provide specialised housing for particular groups of people are suffering great hardship and some of them will almost go into receivership <e> <s> in view of the fact that affordable social housing will not be provided by the housing associations because of the cutback in capital expenditure will the government consider allowing local authorities to spend more of their capital receipts to fill the gap that will be caused by the lack of provision by the housing associations <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> is she aware that many womens groups are concerned about the undue delay in receiving the results of the tests <e> <s> the waiting period in some cases can be as long as two to three months <e> <s> obviously that causes great concern and anxiety to many women who are awaiting the results <e> <s> is the minister further aware that there is a grave shortage of laboratory technicians which is therefore causing delay in receiving the results <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness say what happens in the case of women patients in practices with only male doctors <e> <s> are any provisions made for them to go to another gp or to a hospital for the service <e> <s> as the noble baroness will be aware there are certain groups of women who do not wish to be dealt with by a male doctor <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept figures that were given to me only last week showing that teenagers faced conviction in the central london area <e> <s> does the minister agree that that is a further disadvantage for young people when trying to gain employment <e> <s> not only are they homeless and have little money but they also have a conviction which will go against them when applying for a job <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that full answer <e> <s> i go so far as he does in saying that the foundation might be considered necessary in years time <e> <s> it is important to move the infrastructure from the south of england further north <e> <s> that point is recognised by the government who have spent a great deal of money on liverpool and on the tyne-tees region <e> <s> they clearly recognise that there is a need for the infrastructure to move further north <e> <s> the media is a good part of that infrastructure to move north because the programmes could perhaps be produced more cheaply than they are now when they are based in the south of england <e> <s> i thank the minister for his remarks and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the general public must be thinking what a parsimonious government we have who would reduce services

reduction from to <e> <s> indeed i was looking through the press reports today <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister also aware that there must be people in this chamber whose friends earn more than

to be able to learn to read in schools <e> <s> in the circumstances will she further agree to speak to her right honourable friend the prime minister and ask her to look seriously at these matters
