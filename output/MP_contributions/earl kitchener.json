["<cs> my lords i am fortunate that my aspect of this subject about the importance of which i know there may be two opinions has not yet been aired <e> <s> a possible cause of some crime is diet either faulty in general or wrong for the individual <e> <s> much of the evidence for this comes from the united states of america <e> <s> this is not the place to go into details but particular substances of which shortages seem to be connected with behaviour problems are iron cobalt and vitamin b and among those of which an excess is suspect are lead cadmium highly refined foods and even when taken in very large quantities milk <e> <s> another aspect of nutrition which has been seriously implicated in behaviour is abnormal concentrations of sugar in the blood <e> <s> they may vary very rapidly and seem to be associated with violent behaviour <e>", "<cs> my lords only the government either by the dhss or through bodies dependent upon the government such as the health education council have the resources and authority to publish the best advice on diet <e> <s> as time goes on no doubt better information will become available but it is six years since the working party set up by sir keith joseph reported that there was an urgent need for simple and accurate information on nutrition <e> <s> i hope that the discussions stimulated by the report of the national advisory committee on nutrition education and by the two reports that we are discussing this evening will crystallise into practical recommendations <e> <s> the second of these committees actually constructed diets but did not publish them lest they should be taken as recommendations which they say are needed but should be made by other bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of how much or how little we need of the many things we consume in our diet is closely related to complementary medicine in that it is not something which can only be prescribed by a doctor and does not need expensive drugs <e>"]
