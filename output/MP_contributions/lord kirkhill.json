["<cs> my lords the issue we discuss this evening is a matter on which many of our leading industrialists have voiced public disquiet in recent months and lord mottistone has therefore performed a signal service in initiating this debate <e> <s> incidentally in congratulating the noble earl lord avon upon his becoming an under-secretary of state at the department of energy with the consequence that that department will now have a most compelling voice in this house it may nevertheless be pertinent to remark that there will soon be more partisan occasions when his considerable talents and debating fortitude will perhaps be tested rather more than may be the case this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i did not speak as clearly as i should have done but certainly i was referring to francs <e>", "<cs> my lords we must all i think be indebted to the noble lord lord nathan for raising this question in your lordships house this evening <e> <s> in my view it is worth recalling the terms of reference of the commission appointed by the then government in march under the distinguished chairmanship of the noble lord lord flowers <e> <s> these terms were to advise on the interaction between energy policy and the environment <e> <s> the committee therefore would have to consider the environmental implications <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl the minister able to say what is the real price of whisky today if were to be taken as the base year for calculation <e>", "<cs> my lords as i look around the chamber and see noble lords settling in for the next debate i judge that the present debate has now lasted long enough <e> <s> i believe that it was worth while instigating the debate in your lordships house not least because it allowed those of us who are critical of the governments energy policy to state our case <e> <s> it has also enabled the noble earl the minister especially in the earlier part of his reply to develop the extreme case of the present government namely that consensus is to be undermined that the nationalised industries are to be destroyed and that the caring and compassionate society mentioned by the noble lord lord lovell-davis is to be set on one side <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to the house for my failure to be in my place at the start of this second reading debate but i plead at least in partial mitigation that some disconnected travel arrangements did not quite match the needs of the hour <e> <s> i assure the noble lord lord gray of contin that no discourtesy was intended him <e> <s> to speak <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the recent robroyston difficulty would not the minister agree that scottish office management stands condemned yet again <e>", "<cs> my lords it goes without saying that this most recent percentage cut in the rate support grant is seen as mean-minded on the scottish scene <e> <s> how does the minister justify his earlier assertion that rate increases will not therefore flow from this decision if he bears in mind that as he should know almost all local authority expenditure is centrally imposed either in the form of wage negotiations which must be carried out or through the various other statutes which are carried out by local authorities on behalf of central government <e>", "<cs> with further job losses to follow my lords <e>", "<cs> i merely want to ask one question <e> <s> can the noble lord possibly define or attempt to define what he means by a bad tenant <e> <s> as i understand the experience of most local authorities in scotland it is that as a result of this governments policy houses in the more desirable areas have sold <e>", "<cs> my lords the explanatory and financial memorandum for this bill states that it <e>", "<cs> my lords then the noble and learned lord would at least concede that they are appalled <e>", "<cs> my lords that word was used not by me but by the professional officers concerned <e> <s> the noble and learned lord can certainly get that word in writing <e> <s> there is no difficulty about that <e>", "<cs> my lords my contribution you will no doubt be pleased to learn is not of lengthy duration but is intended rather to invoke ministerial response to an area of important activity about which the bill is curiously silent <e> <s> however before i elaborate upon my criticism i should say that the bill is entitled to the consideration of a cautious welcome and no minister should expect to hear more than that <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend lord carmichael of kelvingrove in all that he says in respect of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am an occasional visitor to the tate gallery as i pass along the embankment to come here <e> <s> i have become increasingly impressed by the considerable extension of interpretation using modern aids that is available to visitors <e> <s> i concede that the trend is noticeable in galleries everywhere <e> <s> however it would be a positive virtue to firm up the bill at this point <e>", "<cs> so far amendment no <e> <s> is concerned no scottish office minister of state could ever justify refusal of this insertion he might try but he could not do so satisfactorily <e> <s> when the board is beginning to dither which is an almost inevitable occurrence given the numbers proposed to constitute the board the then secretary will be able to direct their attention to what will be by then part of the relevant act <e> <s> i predict that it will lead to an immediate concentration of mind which can only be of benefit to scottish arts on the whole <e>", "<cs> i make one brief intervention to remind the minister that the point which the noble lord my good friend lord ross of marnock made is the point that i tried to emphasise at second reading <e> <s> although i know the noble lord the minister gave me a reply upon reading <e>", "<cs> i should like to lend my support to that which has just been said by my noble friend lord carmichael of kelvingrove <e> <s> the use of the phrase special exhibitions perhaps does slightly beg the question if you assume as i do that it is at least open to debate as to what would or would not constitute a special exhibition <e> <s> but in my view such a phrase or a similar one yet to be devised should be inserted in the bill at this point <e> <s> it is wrong in principle to leave the board an absolute discretion over the requirement of payment for admission <e> <s> considerable restrictions should be placed on the board in this regard i believe and my noble friend lord carmichael has enunciated these points with great clarity <e>", "<cs> i hope that when the minister replies he will be able to give the noble lord lord campbell of croy the assurances he seeks <e> <s> for my part i believe that in a bill of this type there should be a positive discrimination in favour of that which can be described as gaelic <e> <s> i give the noble lord lord campbell of croy my full support <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to lend my support to all that my noble friend lord ross of marnock has just said and indeed to give general support to the remarks just made by the noble lord lord grimond <e> <s> the noble lord the minister may recall that on second reading i was particularly concerned that the bill did not seem to give a positive discrimination in favour of the various outstanding municipal galleries of scotland <e> <s> i think that i could just accept the idea of <e>", "<cs> my lords i was never invited and having not been invited i did not turn up <e> <s> i shall conclude by saying that i believe the minister should look very seriously at this issue again <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister of state should accept and should understand that the main reason why we on this side cannot accept his remarks with the generosity that he thinks we should is that his right honourable friend the secretary of state made a massive political miscalculation when he agreed that the revaluation something that has not happened in england for more than a decade should go ahead again a couple of years ago <e> <s> that was the major political mistake and the reason why the noble lord is now defending the indefensible here this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords in commenting upon this bill i want to say something on the scottish dimension of which i have some experience and at the same time express a view about the general tenor and thrust of this proposed legislation <e> <s> therefore it will come as no surprise to your lordships when i indicate that i am dismayed by the governments continued belief that where there are ills to be cured privatisation is the most efficacious medicine <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with much pleasure that i rise to remark upon this bill following the maiden speech of the noble lord lord morton of shuna <e> <s> it is a pleasure greatly enhanced because it gives me the opportunity to welcome a fellow scot to your lordships deliberations <e> <s> moreover one disciplined as is the noble lord in the mystery of scottish law can only be of great benefit to members of the opposition although whether in the course of time the lord advocate will take that view is something which remains to be seen <e> <s> as to the speech itself it surely followed in the great tradition of this house essentially uncontroversial yet with subtlety indicating the probable attitude of the noble lord <e> <s> it is clearly a harbinger of many which will follow which are awaited by the rest of us with keen anticipation <e>", "<cs> my lords and to lockups there will not in any meaningful way be relief to the domestic <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister would give way for one moment <e> <s> can the noble lord tell me what proportion of the total the represents <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e>", "<cs> a few minutes ago the minister quite properly pointed out to all of us who were listening to him that referring to the financial effects of the bill the total amount of rebates given by rating authorities in may be as much as million <e> <s> that of course is the position as printed in the bill <e> <s> but as i attempted i thought reasonably successfully at least from my point of view to point out during the second reading debate i ask the minister to address his mind to this major point the <e>", "<cs> i am not in dispute with the noble lord the minister on that point <e> <s> i accept what he says <e> <s> the point that i was trying to make though i probably did not make it as effectively as i had hoped is this <e> <s> one could go on all night giving examples <e> <s> but very few domestic properties i give this as a prime example have been increased by the factor of three <e> <s> my point is that informed actuarial opinion in scotland says that if the government would make it around this would bring in substantial numbers of domestic properties <e> <s> you will at the same time use the million and the point i have been trying to make to the minister is that publicly the government are always committed to this million <e> <s> that is the politics of the situation on the scottish scene and that is the major point <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for the courtesy of his reply <e> <s> it would be churlish of me to do less than that <e> <s> he paints one scenario and i paint another <e> <s> i think that it is fair to say that i know something of the scottish scene <e> <s> i am a resident of scotland a former lord provost in the city of aberdeen a former minister in the scottish office and a former chairman of the hydro board <e> <s> i think that i know something of what is likely to happen and i believe that my scenario is much more realistic <e> <s> only time will tell which of us is right but from what i know of the scottish scene i believe that i shall be proved right <e> <s> i believe that the community buses will continue to run into the fringes of the urban area and when they do that they will begin to take from the profitable routes and when that happens the big boys will move off the routes <e> <s> but having said that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i listened with some fascination at second reading to the views expressed by the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey <e> <s> in view of those comments it seems most appropriate that my noble friend lord morton of shuna should have put down these amendments for consideration by the committee at the same time giving the noble and learned lord the lord advocate an opportunity to clarify the governments thinking about the criticisms expressed at second reading and which are being expressed now <e> <s> in trying to look at the difficulty from a laymans point of view is not the problem with clauses and simply that they can put a blight upon the property of a commercial interest of a third party during the period probably a long period that passes before the courts determine whether or not the original document truly expresses the intention of its authors <e> <s> perhaps the noble and learned lord the lord advocate will tell the committee whether he takes the view that the bill as drafted comes to grips with the problems created for an innocent third party whose <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that the clause as drafted indeed my noble friend lord morton of shuna has just made this point allows the court of session to decide at its own instance that for example it will no longer allow particular types of divorce case or any types of case to be heard in the supreme court <e> <s> therefore does it not follow that the wishes of both parties to the case can be over-ruled and the court of session can effectively alter its jurisdiction for practical purposes without parliaments express approval though traditionally such approval has been necessary <e> <s> i should be interested to hear what the noble and learned lord the lord advocate has to say on that very point <e>", "<cs> i merely want to ask rhetorically if we can be totally happy about such ultimate sherival wisdom <e>", "<cs> i think that this is an appropriate moment to ask the lord advocate whether he is now in a position to give the governments response to the point which the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey made at second reading half way down col about a case that starts life as a small claim and is converted into a summary cause so that as a consequence corroboration is suddenly required <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble and learned lord the lord advocate noticed that there was much waving of marshalled lists <e>", "<cs> briefly may i congratulate the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for vastly improving in the second half of the committee stage <e> <s> we on this side of the committee are rather better pleased with him than perhaps we were earlier in the afternoon <e> <s> having said that may i say that i commend the amendment of my noble friend lord morton of shuna to the committee for serious consideration and of course to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for his particular consideration <e> <s> i think the public perception of redress has expanded enormously in the decade since the local government scotland act for example and i think that those in the new towns and those who are tenants of the ssha are really entitled to be able to approach the commissioner if they have just complaint <e> <s> i would urge the noble and learned lord the lord advocate to give consideration of the serious character to this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i want merely to say that i too welcome the new amendment brought forward today by the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e> <s> i express my support for the remarks just made by my noble friend lord morton of shuna <e> <s> as i said at an earlier stage in our deliberations i think it is important that this significant change to the bill should be made and speaking personally i am pleased <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> will he keep in mind that in aberdeen there are six research institutes perhaps the most internationally-famous of which is the rowett research institute which are multi-research disciplines which interlock and by the proposed removal of one the impact of the other five is affected <e> <s> will he give to the house his justifications for the proposal that approximately members of staff of the macaulay institute for soil research be transferred to join the hill farming research station at edinburgh which has approximately members of staff <e> <s> logistically i should have thought that the reverse direction would be more appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister think it amazing that daffs have even made the suggestion that the macaulay transfer to edinburgh <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but my earlier point is surely relevant namely that there are only approximately staff at edinburgh as against in aberdeen <e>", "<cs> my lords it may sometimes seem that legal aid is mainly of interest to lawyers and criminals <e> <s> but i believe it is important to recognise that it is a vital public service which many ordinary people will have to call on at some point in their lives <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill seeks to authorise the trustees of the harbours at peterhead to construct extensive harbour works adjacent to their existing undertaking in the area commonly known as south bay peterhead <e> <s> few private measures have evoked such bitterness in recent times and the bill should not pass the house unremarked <e> <s> in essence we have the trustees of the fishing harbour at peterhead very properly seeking to improve their harbour to give greater protection to their harbour entrance and to provide for an expansion of port facilities <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise this afternoon following debate in the other place to make my contribution to this second reading discussion on a gas bill which i believe we must regard as imperfect <e> <s> whether or not one applauds the view of the other place that the industry should indeed be privatised and it goes without saying as i speak from this side of the house that i do not and indeed i associate myself entirely with the formidable remarks made in the earlier stages of the debate by my noble friend lord stodart of leaston by my noble friend lord stoddart of swindon i made the mistake because lord stodart of leaston is a fellow-scot nevertheless we must take a realistic view of the fact that industry is about to be privatised <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for interrupting the minister at this very late stage <e> <s> i want to emphasise to him that my concern was exactly as he said but with an emphasis on the possible marginalisation which can occur in the remoter areas <e> <s> he will see that on the record tomorrow and i hope he will write to me <e>", "<cs> at this late hour i think it would be for the convenience of the committee if i were to speak to the next amendment amendment no <e> <s> which appears on the marshalled list in the names of the noble lords lord taylor of gryfe lord carmichael of kelvingrove and myself <e> <s> while amendment no <e> <s> which has just been explained by the noble lord lord ezra is not exactly the same as amendment no <e> <s> the general thrust of the two amendments is not dissimilar though i think the amendment in the names of the other two noble lords and myself indeed i do not think i am fairly certain goes somewhat further and i believe necessarily so <e>", "<cs> i had not moved my amendment i was just speaking to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i too join with other noble lords in congratulating the noble lord lord shuttleworth on his maiden speech <e> <s> i hope he would be in no way offended if i left it at that simple statement because as the tail of speakers wags endlessly onwards i think it becomes rather more difficult to say something fresh or interesting about what the noble lord said although i confess that i believe his speech was entirely interesting <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> my lords detecting a wide measure of support for my position in your lordships house and ever the skilful parliamentarian as i believe myself to be the minister will no doubt be relieved to know that i shall not be pressing my point to a division <e> <s> however i want to say one thing to him before i resume my seat <e> <s> at the point to which i make reference this is another example of a bill drawn in united kingdom terms which has great significance for trinity house and others but has little or no significance for the more remote geographical areas of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a statement of the obvious which is nevertheless worth some emphasis this afternoon if we keep in mind that the governments declared aim is to reform the basis upon which local government is financed and it follows through their overall objective is to reduce the amount of public spending by introducing in their terms local accountability <e>", "<cs> i know that the minister has just said that he has not seen the precise wording of the amendment and i am aware that earlier he said and i quite agree with his remarks that as matters stand a discretion lies with the local authority <e> <s> whatever he eventually brings before us for our consideration he must keep in mind that some local authorities and this is the real crux of the difficulty and the point of the current complaint are bloody minded about this matter and are reluctant to move towards the very proper position of complaint which these sports clubs sustain <e>", "<cs> i want to support the amendment moved by the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside because i believe it to be important <e> <s> i shall have to consider the point made by the noble lord lord strathclyde which i have not examined <e> <s> however i am not quite sanguine under which heading the charge upon these women might fall <e> <s> it is conceivable that the personal levy could be made <e> <s> were that to be the case then certainly as long as clause remains these womens names would appear on the register and any violent husband would be able to examine that register <e>", "<cs> i should like at this stage to do exactly that <e> <s> in the light of the query raised by the noble lord lord mackie of benshie i should like to make a comment on amendment no <e> <s> which refers to clause page where i wish to leave out subsections and <e> <s> in contrast to the earlier comment made by the noble earl lord perth in relation to his own amendment <e> <s> i do not think that my amendment is flawed on that point <e> <s> i think it takes care of the english difficulty to which the noble earl lord perth has just referred <e>", "<cs> may i intervene for one second only <e> <s> the minister should accept that everyone else in the <e>", "<cs> my name is associated with this amendment <e> <s> i start from the proposition that i do not believe that a married couple or a couple living together should be jointly or severally held responsible for each others community charge <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend withdraws the amendment <e>", "<cs> i asked the minister a quite direct question if one of the couple was unemployed would such a person be able to apply for a rebate <e> <s> i gave some minutes warning and i expected a reply to that question <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make one very brief intervention since my name is also on that amendment <e> <s> i had an informal word with the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside and we agreed in the light of other amendments that in due time when amendment no <e> <s> is called it would be prudent for us not to move into a formal debate exactly in the terms described by the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> in his courteous reply to the points which i put to him the minister said first of all that he was puzzled as to the reason why i had submitted the amendment and rather later he said that the amendment itself was somewhat clumsy <e> <s> to the second of those two propositions i may well agree but the clumsy amendment could be refined in the fullness of time <e> <s> as to his being puzzled over why i had submitted the amendment by now he must have realised that i am opposed to the principle of the collective community charge <e> <s> we shall discuss that point in great detail on clause as the minister knows <e> <s> therefore it is necessary for me at this stage to put down this amendment because it forms part of the overall concept of the collective community charge to which concept i most strenuously object <e>", "<cs> i remind the minister that he and i sometimes are together on the plane to aberdeen at any rate whether we are or not we both go to aberdeen and he will understand if i direct his attention to this thought <e> <s> in portlethen and bridge of don is another example for the reasons already explained many of the comparatively new houses have been standing empty for periods of three four five or six months so that they are quickly vandalised and the gardens are quickly overgrown <e> <s> they are not being sold because when the newcomer arrives he buys a new barratt that is being built in yet another dormitory suburb <e> <s> that is the problem and a real concern to those people who might be considered to own a second home they having had to shift elsewhere to get employment <e>", "<cs> if the minister would not think this an arrogant remark on my part let me say to him that when i used to sit where he now does i always found as did some of the draftsmen perhaps not all of them and most of the mandarins in the scottish office that the noble lord lord gray was usually correct <e>", "<cs> it is now minutes past ten <e> <s> the committee has had a long session today and i am not going to begin a serious argument now <e> <s> however i give the government due warning that i intend to return to this very important matter at a later stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> i accept that the minister has given me something of an assurance <e> <s> i should have been more pleased had he felt able to accept my amendment because it is clearly drafted and has significant impact in its language <e> <s> he will have noticed what some of his noble friends have said <e> <s> i for my part will study carefully his remarks <e> <s> i do not say that i shall not return to this point but i shall at least consider seriously what he has said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the scottish office consultation paper talked about head of household which then became responsible person <e> <s> in practice if this part of the bill is carried into the act one person sharing a flat will have to speak on behalf of some other flat sharer <e> <s> that seems to me to be a most odious concept <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to prolong the discussion unnecessarily but i do not think that the minister is drawing a fair analogy <e> <s> there is benefit from membership of the electoral roll <e> <s> as regards registration if there is a failure to register a penalty ensues <e> <s> my objection is that one flat sharer has an inappropriate responsibility towards one of his fellow flat sharers under this clause of the bill <e> <s> the minister must address himself to the fact that this matter is without precedent in scots law <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> i was just sitting crouched in case i had to interrupt <e> <s> however i did not wish to intervene i thought better of it <e> <s> nevertheless i want the minister to believe that i consider that my use of the word odious was in the circumstances restrained <e>", "<cs> as my name stands to amendment no <e> <s> it is self-evident that i support the tenor of the remarks made from both sides of the committee <e> <s> it was my intention to speak if not at length at least in some detail in support of my amendment and indeed those amendments associated with it <e> <s> however i recognise that it is now after four oclock and i am aware that a number of those of us who have scottish bases wish to catch shuttles to them within the next two hours or so <e> <s> to that extent the minister should be thankful for small mercies because i do not intend to speak other than briefly <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to associate myself with the remarks made by my noble friend lord carmichael of kelvingrove <e> <s> perhaps i may ask the minister to address his mind to one point which although not a major one is worthy of some consideration <e> <s> cosla tells me that the land valuation court will have to establish new principles as a consequence of the bill assuming that it becomes an act <e> <s> that seems quite clear <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not quite understand what the minister was saying <e> <s> i do not blame the minister for his explanation but i should like him to expand it somewhat <e> <s> i do not understand his analogy of a newsagent who might be off-site <e> <s> will he develop that point <e> <s> it seemed to be a palpable nonsense if i may say so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure i have as well <e> <s> my point which i am sure i explained badly was this <e> <s> i did not think the amendment went as far as that <e> <s> i thought the minister took the amendment further than the amendment went <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to refer briefly at least i hope it will be briefly to two propositions to which the minister has not addressed himself at any time during the course of his protracted remarks during the various stages of the bill <e> <s> i should have thought that the suggestion made by my noble friend lord carmichael of kelvingrove that the word contribution might be considered appropriate is valid because the minister has frequently referred to a short-term stay and to the transient individual <e> <s> at no time has the minister sought to define what he or the government mean by short-stay nor has the minister at any time sought to define what he means by transient individual <e> <s> until he does surely the proposition of my noble friend lord carmichael should command support in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords no doubt when the minister comes to make his contribution he will inform the house who will pick up the tag for this concession whatever the percentage is to be <e> <s> the point raised by the noble lord lord grimond is valid because we do not really know what it will be at this stage <e> <s> clearly the local authorities are not going to receive additional subvention or are they <e> <s> on the supposition that they are not then i presume that the average payer of the community charge will have to pay an additional burden as a consequence of this concession <e> <s> this rightly pleases the noble earl lord perth and others but i have considerable reservations <e>", "<cs> my lords unlike the noble lord lord renton i do not consider the possible deletion of this clause at this late stage as being unthinkable <e> <s> indeed i support the amendment and i consider that were it carried it would achieve a considerable improvement though i agree it would be at the cost of the deletion of one of the thrusts of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the minister will be able to accept my noble friends amendment if only because the minister will recall that i raised this point with him at the report stage <e> <s> although i think it is fair to say that he made a response to the points i then raised he might now agree perhaps he might not but i hope that he will that at the very best his remarks could be construed as having been somewhat ambiguous <e> <s> the minister now has the opportunity to be much more specific <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not unique in that <e>", "<cs> my lords at an earlier stage of the bill the noble lord lord campbell of alloway remarked i paraphrase his words that clause was the very heart of the bill <e> <s> he certainly used a phrase of that type <e> <s> i wholeheartedly concur with that view <e> <s> of course the noble lord has subsequently explained to us that he accepted the ministers assurances as they relate to regulations about vulnerable groups <e> <s> i really think that the government have shown a marked lack of compassion and humanity at the very point of true social concern <e> <s> they should be condemned for this and for weasel words <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be usual for my noble friends lord ross of marnock or lord carmichael of kelvingrove or both to stand at this dispatch box upon this occasion <e> <s> but as the noble baroness mentioned and as i now confirm both have an inescapable prior engagement this evening not perhaps entirely unconnected with the events of this week <e> <s> so i find myself standing on this side of the table although for many years i often stood in front of where the noble earl now sits <e> <s> but i am sure that he too will stand at the dispatch box if only for a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not too sure whether or not the minister has actually resumed his seat but on the supposition that he is just on his way down and has not quite got there perhaps i may draw his attention to one facet of difficulty on the scottish local government scene at the moment which i hope that this order might at least more clearly define <e>", "<cs> my lords too join with those who have contributed to the discussion thus far in congratulating the noble earl lord lauderdale on initiating this timely debate <e> <s> the question posed by the heading of the debate is relevant and i agreed with the remarks of the noble earl when he said that it was an absolutely appropriate time in the life of the new parliament for us in this house to discuss the question of energy and its abundance and cheapness or relative cheapness <e> <s> no doubt this subject will subsequently be discussed in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords while i would not necessarily disagree with the minister when he failed to link the numbers sleeping rough in for example the westminster area with the overall impact of government public expenditure would he nevertheless not agree that the constriction as it applies to most local authorities had led to an increasing spirit and sense of urban deprivation <e> <s> would he not agree that that is most apparent in the northern areas of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to thank the noble lord lord ezra for introducing this debate i <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl not understand that this aspect of government policy is causing such concern north of the border because newbattle abbey represents an absolute last chance for a limited number of people <e> <s> in residential terms that opportunity will be removed as a consequence of the probable decision <e>", "<cs> the committee should give serious consideration to the proposal contained within the amendment of my noble friend lord pitt <e> <s> the housing associations which have formed community housing teams would have considerable difficulty in continuing their development if the clause stands as presently drafted <e> <s> we must have regard to the fact that young people aged or years and who are not in employment or full-time education must accept a yts place or be denied the income support <e> <s> only those individuals exempted by the secretary of state will be protected from the effects of this ruling <e> <s> i am advised that many housing associations provide shared accommodation for vulnerable young tenants most of them aged to who have suffered from inadequate or non-existent family support <e> <s> these young people are often unable to cope with the demands of the yts placement due to the detrimental effects of physical mental or sexual abuse suffered by them as young children <e>", "<cs> my lords the other member nations that have signed the optional protocol will accordingly have a view of the british governments position on the matter <e> <s> what has the minister to say to that proposition <e>", "<cs> i also should like to join with others in supporting the remarks made by the noble earl lord selkirk <e> <s> i do that for two reasons first the noble earl through the committee stages of much scottish legislation other than this particular bill has always sought to emphasise the very point that he has made this afternoon as it relates to this bill and as it related to others <e> <s> the truth of the matter is that the ordinary citizen were he to look at the bill in order to discover his position as an assured tenant would probably not find exactly how he stood in the matter <e> <s> if some sort of redrafting as suggested by the noble earl is taken up by the minister then surely those most affected by the bill will know where they stand <e> <s> that will be an improvement and also an improvement in government communication <e>", "<cs> if the government were to accept the amendment it would at least give some sense of security to those who are affected <e> <s> the minister has just been saying how much he wants the bill to find common acceptance <e> <s> here is an opportunity for him to show willing <e>", "<cs> i wanted to make one point to the minister <e> <s> on a number of occasions this afternoon he has expressed his desire that tenants should have a very extensive choice <e> <s> why that choice should preclude the re-affirmation of local authorities as landlords i cannot quite understand <e> <s> i suggest that although a tenant may not be under compulsion when he finds others round about him opting for say landlord a it may well be because the landlord concerned has said that he will rapidly modernise the properties by a given deadline <e> <s> peer pressure develops in such a situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i take part in the debate this morning albeit briefly to discuss not the white paper on the electricity supply industry of england and wales but to make some mention of the situation which is beginning to develop in scotland <e> <s> i make no apology for doing so because i think that the noble viscount lord davidson will agree if i remind him that we had an informal discussion on an earlier energy debate in the house when it was thought that there might be a possibility to discuss the scottish situation <e> <s> however events of a somewhat more serious nature have developed in the house over the past few weeks therefore i take a measure of licence this morning and i hope i do not weary the house if in being reasonably brief i speak about the scottish scene <e>", "<cs> my lords i confine my intervention to one remark <e> <s> the noble baroness lady carnegy alleged that my noble friend lord carmichael although his point of view was tenable had drawn the line at the wrong point <e> <s> the governments position draws the line in the wrong place and is another example of the thrust of this administration their sheer lack of compassion and humanity is a diabolical disgrace to a civilised community <e> <s> this is another example of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no objection <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene because as some members of your lordships house will know i am a former lord provost of aberdeen <e> <s> i associate myself of course with the remarks which have been made by those who have spoken in the past few minutes <e> <s> i continue to live in aberdeen and i know something about the local scene <e> <s> therefore i wish to direct the attention of the minister to one particular and possible problem a problem which i hope is not current at the moment and which i hope will not develop <e> <s> i refer to the fact that there are severe constrictions on the time when aberdeen airport is permitted to be open <e> <s> that is perfectly proper under planning procedures given the location of the airport <e> <s> i can however assure the minister that in the quite recent past there have been difficulties at time of emergency because of complicated interworking arrangements between the various sectors who keep the airport open <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the remarks made by my noble friend lord carmichael of kelvingrove as he sought to move his amendment before the committee this afternoon <e> <s> i do not really believe this but i take it that the government would argue that one of the principal purposes behind this particular piece of legislation is to increase the democratic purpose throughout the school system <e>", "<cs> there are not many supporters opposite <e>", "<cs> i merely wish to put one question to the minister <e> <s> i am referring to clause <e> <s> does he not believe that this provision is inadequate for the regulation of the school board <e> <s> it seems to me to be entirely that <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend withdraws the amendment perhaps the minister would say why it is undesirable to give the boards specific powers <e> <s> the minister has not replied to that question which i put to him directly <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say that i regard that reply as totally unsatisfactory <e> <s> it is the classic ministerial non-reply <e>", "<cs> i wish to add that if the minister is willing to accept this amendment it is written into the bill there would be evidential value if after they had been approved the minutes were challenged <e> <s> given that we do not know yet how some of these school boards will operate in practice i should have thought this would be a very reasonable safeguard to write into the bill <e>", "<cs> it is not to insult future members of boards whomsoever they turn out to be to say that they will essentially he amateur folk rather like ourselves perhaps <e> <s> we know how much we rely upon the efficient professional service accorded to us <e> <s> i am not trying to draw a parallel too directly but i should have thought that even if a paid clerk were the kind who went from tarves to oldmeldrum and then on to clinterty all in one day provided he were paid by a local education authority and had professional backup he would surely be to a boards eventual betterment <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble baroness can enlighten me because i did not quite follow the latter part of her remarks <e> <s> was she saying to the committee that she did not want a professional service to be offered at this point because it was more important to have a voluntary service <e>", "<cs> therefore the noble baroness would not object to voluntary school teachers voluntary doctors and so on <e>", "<cs> is the minister satisfied with his reply <e>", "<cs> subsection is clearly at odds with the law of agency <e> <s> will the minister let us have his observations please <e>", "<cs> i very willingly accept that the minister should reflect upon my most recent observation because that key point is absolutely essential in the sense that we surely cannot continue to consider subsection if it is clearly at odds with the law of agency as i believe it to be <e> <s> therefore i believe that the minister needs to consider this further <e>", "<cs> the minister has just been saying that that which is reasonably required is specific in content <e> <s> can he explain further on that point to the committee <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for what he says is his explanation and i must accept that that is what he thinks <e> <s> however it is not what my noble friend lord carmichael is saying <e> <s> he is saying that this must not be sacrosanct for the reasons he has annunciated <e> <s> i believe that one needs more comprehension in reply from the minister <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that this is yet another example of the present government belabouring local authorities in the name of the tory political credo <e> <s> frankly it is an absolute political disgrace <e>", "<cs> the minister in his reply must refer to the phrase tattie howkin <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a split of north-east graciousness which is quite remarkable <e> <s> i have one question for the minister <e> <s> what kind of activity does he envisage might occur which would be of such consequence that a board might wish to report to parents <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to discuss the bill briefly as it applies and relates to scotland <e> <s> if i have an interest to declare it is of a retrospective character in that i was at one time chairman of the north of scotland hydroelectric board <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for interrupting the minister as he gets into his stride <e> <s> i would normally restrain myself <e> <s> but i want to ask him just one further point as i do not quite follow his reply <e>", "<cs> i intervene to remind some members of the committee that i was chairman of the hydro board between and <e> <s> therefore i stand arraigned and fully culpable for an attempt on behalf of the board to impose in a diesel island area surcharge <e> <s> on second reading i made it clear that i was opposed to the basic ethos which lies behind this bill <e> <s> i do not support the proposition that we should turn what is at present a public monopoly into what will virtually become a private monopoly <e> <s> i regard that kind of public policy-making as entirely politically mischievous <e> <s> i am quite opposed to the government on that major point <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister confirm or otherwise that the secretary of state for defences majority of might be a factor in the governments calculations <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene very briefly to suggest to the minister that he might look northwards to the present practice of the north of scotland hydro-electric board <e>", "<cs> i accept all that the noble lord says <e> <s> i thought that his noble friends lord peyton lord stanley and others might think it a good idea were he to look northwards once again <e>", "<cs> i take this opportunity to intervene briefly to say how much i support the argument which the noble lord lord campbell of croy has just developed <e> <s> i believe that he has done so with masterly attention to detail <e> <s> as some members of the committee will know and as the noble lord lord sanderson certainly knows i have some experience in this matter given that i was chairman of the hydro board for some four years or so <e> <s> i honestly do not believe that i can add to what the noble lord has just said so i refrain from irrelevant additional comment <e>", "<cs> i should have wished to attach my name to the amendment but my commitments to the council of europe are such that i did not expect to be present in committee this afternoon <e> <s> however my arrangements altered and i am able to be here <e>", "<cs> my lords although this may be a little wide of the original question on the order paper would the noble lord care to comment on the proposition that though an adequate road link between the west of scotlands urban belt and prestwick exists adequate rail links do not <e> <s> if the latter problem were given attention would that not overcome the difficulty referred to by the noble lord lord taylor <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble lord lord jenkin should reflect upon the fact that many local government officers professional in every sense of that word choose to serve in the public service as a matter of conscience and social persuasion <e> <s> by doing so they usually enjoy if that is the correct word a lower salary than they would otherwise have obtained had they been engaged in the private sector <e> <s> to further deny them the opportunity of political persuasion by being a representative in another local authority is entirely draconian <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with other noble lords who have spoken in the debate in giving voice to the complaint that we should have a second <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept with regret that the minister cannot say more this afternoon about the position in scotland <e> <s> but can he give an assurance to the house that he will convey to his right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland this thought that those who are resident in scotland and who have been paying the poll tax have already been paying a higher average level than will now be the case in england if the increased rebate arrangements are carried through here <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord resumes his seat perhaps i may intrude a thought which he might consider <e> <s> i have not taken part in the various stages of the bill for a good and proper reason from my own point of view although i made a minor contribution at second reading <e> <s> the minister may recall and if he does not i shall remind him that i view the bill with distaste <e> <s> i regard it as a bill of the utmost partisan prejudice on the part of a very right-wing conservative administration <e> <s> i regard it as one which will go a long way towards ruining the essential comprehensive nature of the scottish educational system the inherent nature of which i have long supported <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the minister will recognise that in any good school in scotland the kind of proposal that he is laying before this house today is certainly not practised at the present time <e> <s> in fact the only people who will be seriously disadvantages will be the parents who will become excessively competitive about nothing <e>", "<cs> my lords we must all be appreciative of the fact that the noble lord lord campbell of croy has raised in a short debate a subject matter which is of pressing interest and of continuing difficulty <e> <s> the noble lord in a wide-ranging speech touched upon the questions of sewage disposal chemical dumping long sea outfalls effluent disposal and other such matters <e> <s> i myself want to concentrate rather more on the continuing war which exists between the offshore oil industry and the fishing industry <e> <s> it is a mini-war but it could almost be described as a war <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply but can he now tell the house why the scottish generating boards which apparently previously were at the top of the sell-off queue now find themselves at the bottom <e>", "<cs> my lords now that the minister has given an indication of the sell-off date can he tell the house when the licensing document is likely to be issued <e> <s> i ask not as a supporter of the sell-off as the noble earl lord lauderdale seems to think i am although i am a well known opponent but rather i am concerned about the consumers of electricity in scotland and about the workforces of the two generating boards <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree with me that the continuing private ownership of the majority of professional football clubs makes it difficult to have true community involvement <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a cheap and easy jibe for the noble lord to make <e> <s> it is not what i suggested nor did i imply that <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble and learned lord can help me <e> <s> i have asked this question before <e> <s> some noble lords may have decided what they will do or not do with the various amendments that they have tabled <e> <s> the noble and learned lord has used such phrases as we shall consider and we hope to <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to ask only one question <e> <s> the ministers statement that about million will be saved over the next three years will be received with a great deal of difficulty and heart-searching by the fishing community because of his implacable opposition thus far at any rate to any sensible decommissioning policy <e>", "<cs> i am ambivalent about my noble friends amendment <e> <s> i have no strong feelings about it one way or the other <e> <s> the question i wish to ask the minister is this did the government give consideration to an uneven number of members such as five seven or nine <e> <s> sometimes there is an advantage in having such numbers on a board <e>",

that to the minister <e>", "<cs> this gets scottish enterprise off on the wrong foot <e> <s> most major local authorities in scotland are labour controlled <e> <s> some of them are already suspicious of the inbuilt business bias which the new scottish enterprise board will tend to show <e> <s> if the government are serious about an act of entrepreneurial co-operation it would advance the common good to accept my noble friends amendment or a similar amendment <e> <s> it is because the government are not seen by the public in scotland to do that although the government think that they do that
