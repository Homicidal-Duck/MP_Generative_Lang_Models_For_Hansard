["<cs> i support the amendment that authorises the police to deal with licences <e> <s> it should be nothing to do with the red deer commission at all <e> <s> the commission should not be concerned with licensing <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble viscount <e> <s> it is not a question of not knowing about <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord northfield mentioned the act and why shooting at night has been penalised and made more offensive than any other form of offence <e> <s> the reason for that was that the vast majority of the poaching prior to was being done by people in vehicles at night <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ross of marnock sometimes forgets that in the end it is the owner who will be responsible <e> <s> if the tenants crop is eaten by deer probably the tenant will go to the owner and ask for compensation <e>", "<cs> the act was founded on compromise on the one hand trying to cut down on poaching and on the other hand trying to help those who are trying to raise crops be they agricultural or forestry crops <e> <s> may i suggest to my noble friend lord glenarthur that he tries some compromise over this very difficult clause <e>", "<cs> there is one aspect that has not been mentioned and that is the danger of night shooting <e> <s> shooting at night is always dangerous but if it is done by unskilled people it is highly dangerous <e> <s> this should be taken into account <e>", "<cs> i am afraid my noble friend lord glenarthur is quite wrong in what he said about roe deer and night shooting <e> <s> as has already been stated deer are territorial <e> <s> if you shoot one old buck what happens is that four or five young ones will come in and take his place and you will have four or five times the damage done to your trees <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lord lord northfield in what he has said about the <e>", "<cs> of course <e>", "<cs> i did not say not consult i said not use the nfu-cla package <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall begin by declaring an interest because i have now been a tenant farmer for years <e> <s> i should like to welcome this bill in general and like the noble lord lord moran especially clause which imposes a duty on ministers to achieve a balance between agriculture economic and social interests and conservation <e> <s> i believe that the interpretation of this clause could have far-reaching effects on the rural areas <e>", "<cs> i simply do not believe that this will save or bring in million if adas make any charge <e> <s> it might bring in a thousand or two at best <e> <s> what will happen is that the adas man who obviously wants to keep his job will come to ones farm and investigate say a piggery <e> <s> the first thing he will say is let us look at what effect this alteration will have on duck flighting onto a nearby pond because if i do that then i do not have to charge for it <e> <s> that is what will happen <e> <s> the adas man will bend over backwards so that there is no charge <e> <s> by doing that he will have a job <e> <s> in the end it will be complete nonsense <e> <s> it is simply not worth making any charge at all because one will get nothing out of it if one does make a charge <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that when it comes to promotion or recruitment it is standards that count and not colour <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with other noble lords in congratulating my noble friend lord belstead on the way that he has handled the bill <e> <s> he has bent over backwards sideways and forwards to answer the many points that have been raised on all sides of the house <e> <s> in general i welcome the bill and wish it a speedy passage <e> <s> much will depend upon what ministers make of the powers that have been given to them by the bill <e> <s> i am uncertain as to whether charging for some of the advisory services will bring about the results that the ministry wants <e> <s> i am in no doubt that the advisory services will continue to be as helpful to farmers in the future as they now are <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble baroness will forgive me if i do not follow her line of thought <e> <s> i wish to return to the scottish scene for a moment <e> <s> i welcome the programme of legislation for scotland as outlined in the gracious speech <e> <s> it is only right that other aspects of the scottish scene should come under scrutiny because today there is obviously a lack of confidence in scotland especially when it is compared with the south of england where there is notable confidence <e>", "<cs> my lords one aspect of the bill which seems to have united every noble lord who has spoken in the debate is that the governments thoughts on the future of broadcasting have progressed a long way since the white paper was issued <e> <s> upon that the government are to be congratulated <e> <s> however many people both inside and outside the house are expressing concern over the future quality of television programmes <e> <s> it is right that concern should be expressed <e> <s> television <e>"]
