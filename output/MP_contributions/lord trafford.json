["<cs> my lords i welcome this bill <e> <s> first i must thank the noble lord lord stallard for his kind remarks <e> <s> if i had had a sense of <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down it seems to me that a very strange argument is being produced here a fixed penalty for a fixed crime that is to say the failure of the carrier to carry out his responsibilities <e> <s> the suggestion opposite is that if the carrier employs incompetent people in some parts of the world or has shortsighted or defective officials this is in some way an excuse <e> <s> if there is one fixed maximum penalty everybody knows where he stands <e> <s> if there is a range of penalties you could have a variety of semi-intelligent officials or a variety of defective employees who could be blamed <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand fully the noble lords point which is that under very special circumstances the discretion of the secretary of state might apply <e> <s> i am suggesting that to put in an amendment such as this which is to give effect to certain types of argument put forward which i was outlining would be an error <e> <s> although i accept that the secretary of states discretion is perfectly satisfactory in this field to suggest to carriers that there are many gradations of competence of their employees or for any other reason that may explain how they could get away with it would be an error <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make one point <e> <s> we have talked a great deal about the legal aspects of the type of appeal that could be heard and ruled upon by a county court judge <e> <s> but this amendment destroys the part of the bill with reference to the discretion of the home secretary <e> <s> it removes the discretionary powers in the sense that with an appeals tribunal you are undermining or removing those powers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble lord would not expect me to follow him into the realms of local government reform <e> <s> i wish to make two brief comments in the field of higher education <e> <s> before making such comments i should perhaps declare an interest in that i am privileged to be a pro-chancellor and chairman of council of a university <e>", "<cs> surely some of us are being a little ungenerous in not giving credit to the movers of the amendment for their concern with safety <e> <s> i do not think the question of cost arose in the movers statement <e> <s> we should give them credit for that but it is somewhat ludicrous to suggest that in the next part of the bill where we shall discuss the question of a safety authority at the same time we should tie the authoritys hands and feet by saying precisely what it should do now six years before the tunnel is built <e> <s> surely we should give credit to those moving the amendment for their concern for safety and at the same time however conscious we happen to be in this year about safety leave the actual technical details and the implementation of that safety to those who are subsequently appointed to carry out that function <e>", "<cs> i feel slightly uncomfortable about this amendment as it stands <e> <s> it does not seem to me that it can be argued that there is any obligation on a home secretary to do other than make up his own mind or to take any advice <e> <s> there is nothing here that compels him so to do <e> <s> there is nothing that gives the accused person the right to any form of appeal <e>", "<cs> will the minister answer a question of interest <e> <s> it is what is the position of a presidential pardon <e> <s> is that president not part of the federal constitution of the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords first let me say that the noble lord lord lovell-davis has performed a public service in putting down this motion <e> <s> he has given your lordships house the opportunity to focus on a very important question that of child health <e> <s> i can certainly agree with the statements made in both of the reports named in the motion that there can be no more important investment for the future than healthy children <e>", "<cs> my lords i was one of those who expressed reservations about this matter in committee <e> <s> like my noble friend lord boyd <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will forgive me if i do not follow his remarks directly but i wish to comment upon one or two other points <e> <s> paradoxically i feel that one of the areas that needs research is that of research and development itself <e> <s> we mean a number of different things when we refer to research <e> <s> the select committee and both papers that we are discussing broadly follow the division into fundamental strategic and applied research <e>", "<cs> my lords i have every sympathy with the three noble lords who have spoken with regard to both the horrendous experience through which people may have to pass and the requirement for information <e> <s> if i recall correctly i confess that i am speaking off the top of my head the minister told us in committee when we discussed this matter that there was a positive result in about per cent <e> <s> of such searches <e> <s> i am not sure of those figures <e> <s> i am sure that i shall be corrected if i am wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that i thought none of the three noble lords had mentioned the <e>", "<cs> perhaps it behoves a layman who is not a lawyer to speak since we have heard from no one but lawyers for hours really <e> <s> there are a few factors which raise a query <e> <s> large numbers of people in this country work for the government either intermittently or constantly <e> <s> those people do not have any rights in statutes with regard to payments or settlement of their payments <e> <s> claims about the ability to turn to strike action are relatively meaningless in connection with a lot of the professions although i accept that in many fields strike action is a weapon which is available <e>", "<cs> i should like to point out that the noble and learned lord lord ackner has not quoted me correctly <e> <s> i said nothing about recruitment to the bar <e> <s> indeed the committee later heard that over the past years the bar has considerably expanded <e> <s> furthermore i point out to the noble and learned lord that apart from misquoting me in this context in many professions there are difficulties in recruitment related to various factors not only to salaries although often attributed to salaries <e> <s> it may be that a nasty suspicion creeps into my mind that it was not that he misunderstood me but perhaps understood me only too well <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that the secretary of state does not really have the power or the right under the act to order regional health authorities to expend money in this way or that unless he makes a special allocation but only to provide a total grant <e>", "<cs> my lords i always find it somewhat difficult when speaking on the subject of social security to refrain from lecturing the government on my own pet hobbyhorse of the reorganisation of social finance which would make it simpler better and so on <e> <s> this is not perhaps an appropriate occasion on which to do so but i could point out that simplification of the system has one overwhelming virtue <e> <s> we would not have every months sometimes months or at even shorter intervals yet another social security bill to go through both houses <e>", "<cs> i have some sympathy with the intention expressed in this amendment but i am a bit worried about the wording <e> <s> it seems to me that the crises which are likely to arise once tenders have been put forth and accepted are not altogether dissimilar to the sort of crises which are likely to arise now <e> <s> if these crises arise at the present time they will not arise because of natural disasters which occur and where special arrangements are made <e> <s> presumably in every contract for tender this type of thing will be taken into account <e>", "<cs> with due respect to the noble lord i think he has misinterpreted at least in part what was said <e> <s> first there was no criticism of direct labour in anything i said <e> <s> i would expect contracts frequently to go to the in-house labour force <e> <s> there was no criticism implied or otherwise of the labour that was involved following the hurricane <e> <s> in that respect i entirely endorse every remark the noble lord made <e> <s> i referred to snow clearance and i think it was slightly unfair of him to make those points <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has put it far more elegantly than i did when i suggested that they might be idle <e> <s> i take the point <e> <s> however it would seem to be an extremely expensive way of doing it <e> <s> a pluralistic approach which is what this amendment really advocates is nearly always more expensive <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that this bill has been brought before this committee with a long history of negotiation between a large number of authorities all of whom for different reasons have generally the same objective in mind namely to produce an authority that could cover the variety of functions laid out under clause a b and c which are the three main agreed functions of this bill <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord is suggesting that only three out of will be interested in conservation then he is almost certainly wrong because it is most unlikely that for example the members appointed by the local authorities or indeed the nine under the present bill appointed by the secretary of state would also be totally uninterested in this <e>", "<cs> i take the point in worrying about this amendment mainly with regard to its wording i understand fully the intention of the noble lord lord peston in moving his amendments and i share the anxieties of my noble friend lord campbell of alloway about amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> as regards amendment no <e> <s> in view of what was said in this afternoons debate i wonder whether it is necessary at all because surely there will be no proceedings taken here <e> <s> the true answer to the question how one would act as a librarian is that if one is as a librarian carrying out ones proper function and duty which is to get a proper selection of books including those of literary merit one would continue to select such books <e> <s> i do not believe that under this kind of provision which after all is only a restriction on local authorities librarians would have anything to fear <e> <s> i am sure we shall hear again from the minister perhaps i misheard him earlier that that fear is without any grounds <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will answer the question <e> <s> it seems to me that he answered his own question in his choice of words and so did the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington <e>", "<cs> my lords i yield to nobody in my support for the severely disabled but like my noble friend lord renton i am in a quandary <e> <s> i am slightly confused by the amendment tabled by the noble lord <e> <s> i should have preferred to say something after the minister had given us the benefit of the answers to some of the questions asked <e> <s> unfortunately that is <e>", "<cs> my lords i was going to make the same point as my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter and i should like to ask a further question <e> <s> there is nothing in the amendment although the noble baroness spoke at some length about it on the question of an appeal to a tribunal <e> <s> the amendment refers only to the parliamentary commissioner <e> <s> there is nothing in it about an appeal to a tribunal yet the noble baroness continued to refer to an appeal to a tribunal <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully understand why there is nothing in the amendment about an appeal to a tribunal but that was the matter to which the noble baroness was referring all the time <e> <s> in fact the amendment refers to the parliamentary commissioner and it is my understanding as it is that of my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter that social fund officers are subject to the jurisdiction of the parliamentary commissioner <e> <s> furthermore the parliamentary commissioner is no substitute for an appeal tribunal because as i understand it the noble baroness was really asking what an aggrieved party could do about a decision taken by the social fund not about the question of maladministration although doubtless that could come into some aspects of these cases <e> <s> in other words there is no way in which the parliamentary commissioner can say that a particular social fund decision is wrong <e> <s> he can say that the way the decision was taken was wrong but that is nothing to do with a tribunal <e> <s> as regards the amendment my understanding is that indeed they are subject to the parliamentary commissioner but i remain open to correction from my noble friend the minister when he replies <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord <e> <s> lord ennals sits down when he was in government he was concerned at one time with the introduction of cash limits <e> <s> at that time and ever since the term cash limits had meant particular accounting practices <e> <s> it also had particular financial consequences <e> <s> that is different from a budget <e> <s> if one sets up an office to administer the social fund in an area it must have a budget or it cannot function <e> <s> you cannot say let us operate a social fund according to a few rules here and there <e> <s> you have to say how much money it can use <e> <s> you have to say this is the preliminary target and that is how you budget for something <e>", "<cs> my lords before making any remarks i should declare my interest <e> <s> for the past years i have worked in the national health service and i think i am right in saying that at present i am the only actively practising hospital consultant in this house <e> <s> that does not of course alter my personal commitment to the national health service and what it stands for and we have heard a great deal about that today <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope to break the record for brevity in this debate <e> <s> the noble lord lord jenkins of hillhead in his interesting and enjoyable speech earlier this afternoon asked why universities were included in the bill at all <e> <s> if he had been with me at the association of commonwealth universities meeting in australia last month and i happen to know that he was not he would have been most interested to hear the debate on the relationship between the universities and the state and their role in national life in the last quarter of this century and on into the next <e> <s> i do not think he could then have suggested as he rather did today that the best of all possible things was happening in the best of all possible worlds and we could leave the universities alone to get on with it themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords we are told that the national health service is undergoing a review at the present time <e> <s> however i have not seen any rumours reported in the media or elsewhere of the place of public health in that review <e> <s> therefore it is very pertinent that the noble lord lord hunter of newington should raise the subject for debate <e> <s> i am sure that we are all grateful to him <e>", "<cs> we on this side have had very little to say on this subject <e> <s> we have allowed the opposition a fair crack of the whip <e> <s> i have some sympathy with many of the sentiments that have been expressed although it is difficult to encompass them <e> <s> we have been to the stars and back on this amendment which seemed so simple when it was moved <e>", "<cs> if the noble baroness looks at <e>", "<cs> so far as i know nobody in this committee has ever tried to defend geography <e> <s> perhaps i may suggest to the noble lord and not as a great defender of geography simply that it covers many of the things he is talking about the north-west awareness the environment meteorology and a host of other things <e> <s> geography is itself a broad subject <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord truly arguing that if a large number of people are miserable and a few people are happy we should all be miserable because in those circumstances nobody should be happy <e> <s> that is the basis of the noble lords argument at the moment <e>", "<cs> i agree with many of the comments made by the noble earl who has just spoken with regard to the practical nature of the matter <e> <s> however i think that he is expressing in part if i may use the expression with the greatest of respect some of the arrogance of the education planners <e> <s> the assumption always seems to be from planners and from professionals in most public sector areas i include doctors that the professional always knows best that teacher always knows best and that it is impossible for a parent to make intelligent choices <e>", "<cs> i understand that point <e> <s> however it seems to me that what the right reverend prelate is actually saying is that we have a series of difficulties in socially deprived areas and in the schools in and around those areas but we must make specific choices to force people to stay in certain schools simply for those reasons <e> <s> it seems to me that that is trying in such circumstances to engineer a situation of no change by which one does not promote improvement <e> <s> we can promote improvement by the involvement of parents <e> <s> that is central to this part of the bill <e> <s> despite what the noble baroness has said rather politely this is a wrecking amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say that i was pointing out the arrogance of professions i certainly was not criticising the noble earl lord baldwin of bewdley for arrogance in the way be spoke <e> <s> i stand by that <e> <s> i believe that professionals often put forward the suggestion that they and only they know be it in medicine the law or in educational establishments <e>", "<cs> i think that for once i perhaps agree with a great deal of what the noble baroness lady <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may take up a remark made by the noble baroness lady david <e> <s> surely that matter is largely covered in clause a which states <e>", "<cs> i listened with great interest to the speech of the noble baroness and i sympathise with a good deal of it <e> <s> she outlined some of the problems with which anybody taking over the management of what is a significant financial and administrative undertaking will be confronted <e> <s> in addition the directly educational teaching duties of such a person will be quite a burden <e> <s> however i feel stongly that financial delegation in most public sector areas including education is beneficial <e> <s> i say that for a number of reasons <e> <s> first and foremost for those who have worked at the other end of the telescope so to speak in this field it is extremely welcome to see those acting directly at the point of what might be called delivery in this case it is schools having a control over their own budgets <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all grateful to the noble lord lord molloy for the opportunity of discussing this important subject <e> <s> it is customary to declare ones interest when making a speech in this house and mine in this respect is quite simple <e> <s> i love nurses <e> <s> i have worked with them for more than years and my admiration and respect has if anything increased <e> <s> in fact i even married one and i can recommend that to those who are considering such a step <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the noble lord before he moves off the subject of project which i agree is most interesting whether he could explain or enlarge upon one aspect of his demands to the minister <e> <s> how would he deal with the per cent <e> <s> reduction in ward staffing from the service point of view which i believe is critical to the project <e>", "<cs> i should not have risen to speak except for the remark made by the noble lord lord peston that business people are so useless <e> <s> i do not find that acceptable and i disagree with him <e> <s> within the field with which they are familiar they are extremely valuable <e> <s> the major function we are discussing is education <e> <s> other bodies are stated as being represented for example the professions <e> <s> i draw to the attention of those proposing the amendment that the bill states any profession which allows for an extremely wide range of people <e> <s> i am not entirely certain of the definition of a profession or whether it can be regarded as any activity that calls itself a profession <e> <s> be that as it may i find the remarks of the noble lord lord peston to be slightly wide of the mark <e> <s> i do not believe that people who serve in business commerce or the professions lose sight of the importance of education <e> <s> indeed they are usually most keen upon educational attainments or whatever other skills they are looking for <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to turn this into an argument about whether businessmen are educated in one way or another but i do not accept any one of the three propositions about business people put forward in such general terms by the noble lord <e> <s> i too have experience of such bodies and i have not found that <e> <s> i have found that such people use their expertise usually fairly sparingly in areas with which they are familiar <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make a point to the committee <e> <s> every member who has spoken has said that the view is unanimous but it is not unanimous <e> <s> i for one also have considerable experience of this over years or more <e> <s> i believe that we are making a mountain out of a molehill because my attitude would be slightly different <e> <s> it would be who is the student representing the students <e> <s> we have had good ones when we only needed one and that one has made a tremendous mark <e> <s> we have had two when the two were good or the two were bad <e> <s> therefore it has been extremely variable <e> <s> it seems to me that if we are in this predicament where there is any slight division of opinion my noble and learned friend might consider discussing the matter with the secretary of state to see whether it is critical for the bill <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the comments of my noble friends <e> <s> this part of the bill follows the croham report whereby the ufc is substituted for the ugc with the deliberate intention <e>", "<cs> having listened to the discussion perhaps we can clarify the position <e> <s> we are talking about two different things <e> <s> surely these amendments do not really apply <e> <s> reinstatement is automatic if the internal procedures determine that no dismissal has taken place <e> <s> the academic is automatically back in post <e> <s> so how on earth can reinstatement apply to a situation where he has not been if i can use the word deinstated <e> <s> that is what the procedures are about <e>", "<cs> they are irrelevant <e>", "<cs> i shall not detain the committee for long <e> <s> i hope very much that my noble friend will look favourably upon this amendment <e> <s> there are a number of arguments which have already been adduced on both sides of the committee on this subject for example the relevance of the introduction of project and the fact that nurses will become students in full-time education in the same sense or we assume in the same sense <e> <s> we do not know yet the details of the actual introduction <e> <s> there is also the fact that this measure will be introduced at approximately the same time as the community charge comes into play <e> <s> there are some differences relative to scotland <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps he will consider the point that there is a difference between some of the types of education that he has mentioned and nursing education <e> <s> the basis of the case that was put forward was that nurses are at the moment paid employees and are also trained but in future they will be in full-time education <e> <s> that was the first point put to my noble friend the minister <e> <s> that is the difference between some of those to whom my noble friend lord renton was referring and nurses as they will be not as they are now <e> <s> this is not to be confused with the other point which is that of low pay although we should be grateful to the noble lord lord morton of shuna for pointing out to us exactly how to solve the nursing problem in england <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to rise again to interrupt my noble friend but he has missed my point <e> <s> for half the time a lawyer is training he is a full-time student <e> <s> he then does pupilage or works in a solicitors office and so on <e> <s> that is different from what a nurse does <e> <s> at present a nurse never does that <e> <s> a nurse is a full-time employee who also at times is trained <e> <s> that will <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down perhaps i may ask for clarification of that point <e> <s> in the case of my noble friend lord renton what if both registration officers decide that his main residence is in their respective areas <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down why is it not possible for him to take this back <e> <s> as in other elections for tax it is for the individual to decide <e> <s> in terms of capital gains tax on primary or secondary residences the individual makes the election to the tax authorities <e> <s> why is it not possible to follow the same practice <e> <s> my noble friend has suggested that times change <e> <s> in that case the election would have to change as well <e> <s> this is already the common practice and has been for years for all other matters of taxation <e> <s> if the practice were to follow exactly the same way i can see no reason why the matter could not be resolved and then the problem which the noble lord lord morton and i have raised would not and could not arise <e>", "<cs> with due respect to the noble lord lord morton this applies now in respect of capital gains tax and ones decision of residence <e> <s> in the case of my noble friend lord renton whose domestic affairs are being aired around the committee it is probably the case although i do not know his actual residence that for capital gains tax purposes he would elect to say that he lives in london rather than in huntingdon but the other way round if he were trying to carry out the procedures which the noble lord lord morton has just pointed out in regard to community charge <e> <s> if one made that election for both purposes one could not have different elections <e> <s> the election would have to be the same <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down i wonder whether he would consider another aspect which bears on the proposal to delay the introduction of the charge for a year <e> <s> i think it was on tuesday that the noble lord lord morton of shuna pointed out that over the year between there would be a net emigration of nurses from scotland to england <e> <s> it must be said of course that many of us in england would be grateful should this happen because it would solve the english nursing problem <e> <s> however although the further delay of a year would mean another year in which this problem might be <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to enter into the emotional content of the problems that have been outlined but it seems to me that noble lords opposite and those noble lords who have supported the amendment have not answered two fundamental questions partly put by the noble lord lord marsh <e> <s> the first is that if we pass an enabling bill in preparation for privatisation the company cannot be taken to the market if we say that it is still to be partly nationalised because it will be subject to the diktat decision or whatever of the secretary of state for scotland <e> <s> we should then be taking a hybrid company to the market and saying this is not truly a private company it will not truly have independence it will not truly be run by its board of directors it will have to be subject in a large part of its undertakings to the whim of government <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount give way <e> <s> he is misquoting the article in the <e>", "<cs> my lords it is unusual for me to be able to agree with so much of what has been said from the other side of the house but on this occasion i really do <e> <s> the noble lord lord peston is absolutely correct in saying that the breadth of a-levels should be expanded and that the very high concentration that is now put into what we call the two bs and an a result is incorrect <e> <s> if i may use a metaphor one now sees the almost hot-house product brilliant in two fields and virtually ignorant in many others <e> <s> i hope that as a result of the other changes in the bill this will tend to change and that there will be a much broader base from which to develop a-levels and the breadth of the a-level syllabus <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer and while not paralysed with ecstasy i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have great sympathy with the general tenor of the remarks of the noble lord lord flowers in proposing the amendment <e> <s> if i have any question it is simply to ask whether it is wise that what one might call fairly detailed instructions should be set in statute stone <e> <s> it seems to me that some of the arguments put forward for example that the recent allocation of ugc funds was based on a research-related review are perfectly accurate <e> <s> of course teaching came down the line one reason being that it was difficult to reach any form of agreement on how such an assessment could actually be made <e>", "<cs> my lords it is extremely difficult not to agree with the noble lord lord swann on his description of contracts and contracting <e> <s> in one sense he is referring to only part of the problem because the examples of contracts that he gave referred to departments not ugcs and universities not ufcs-to-be and universities but to departments and research groups <e> <s> those who recall his speech at committee stage will remember this <e> <s> he also referred to research councils and to any department dealing with the professions <e> <s> i drew his attention to some contracts drawn up by the dhss which were as bad or nearly as bad though i have not seen the argicultural examples to which he referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express my support for this amendment <e> <s> it is of course a pleasure to support the noble lord lord flowers on this occasion rather than to disagree with him even if mildly as has happened previously <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend the minister is aware that the number of overseas students of all varieties is steadily rising <e> <s> the regimes from which they come even if they are apparently fairly mild at the time when the students come here can change quite dramatically while they are here <e> <s> therefore it seems to be that what is proposed is not unreasonable <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment because it seems that it has two points very much more in its favour than the amendment discussed at committee stage <e> <s> first it is not asking the government to do anything specific at this time and neither is it asking them to grant to student nurses on the basis of being student nurses any particular relief <e> <s> at the committee stage the point was made that student nurses earn a certain salary and that many other people do not earn greater salaries yet they have to pay the community charge <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down perhaps i may ask him a question on this point <e> <s> i do not think that he addressed himself to the fact that this amendment is different to the one moved in committee <e> <s> this is an enabling amendment with discretionary powers to avert the possibility of a particular situation arising it does not contain a request as did the amendment which was moved in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i spoke at committee stage on this matter and i shall not repeat my comments <e> <s> however there are several points which are worth making on the new amendment <e> <s> i agree <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is being slightly ingenuous here <e> <s> in the first instance the powers refer <e>", "<cs> are we not getting slightly on to a cross-wired course here <e> <s> as i understand it the amendments can apply only to the successor company and corporation they cannot apply subsequently to the private corporation in the private sector although one could make some arrangement for them to be put as my noble friend the minister said in the printed paper office the library or somewhere else <e> <s> you cannot in fact apply these amendments as they stand to any company other than the successor company <e>", "<cs> this clause and the amendment apply to income generation and give various powers to health authorities via the secretary of state to generate income <e> <s> it says that the secretary of state can do a number of things <e> <s> to quote two of them he has the power <e>", "<cs> that presupposes that he expects that either they will switch positions or the secretary of state for social services will change <e> <s> the noble earl also hinted and it would be unusual for one of the speeches of the noble earl not to hint that if his advice were not followed desperate events would happen and the state of the nation would be at risk <e> <s> if i quote him correctly he said that he himself was not going to attribute this but that outside he would have great difficulty in persuading others that dark forces were not at work <e> <s> all these dark forces are at <e>", "<cs> yes i can <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that sir mark richmond and others including the noble earl are anxious about the substance of some of these contracts <e> <s> i am not arguing about that <e> <s> as i said in reply to the noble lord lord swann when he first moved that motion i accepted what he said about the restriction on academic matters of those particular contracts <e> <s> but i am arguing that this is not part of this amendment <e> <s> nobody is going to exploit anybody <e>", "<cs> i did not say and i do not say that i disagree with a lot that the noble lord has just said about contracts <e> <s> indeed it was said over and over again on many sides of the chamber throughout the education bill <e> <s> i am not disagreeing with the noble lord <e> <s> what i say is that this clause is about income generation and not about basic researchers rights or the dark forces of secretaries of state or anything else <e>", "<cs> i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord ennals on now being back on the rails and speaking to an amendment which is relevant to this issue <e>", "<cs> i understand the argument put forward by the noble lord with regard to the extent of the powers <e> <s> he is certainly managing to extend these powers on every part of this clause <e> <s> we have discussed paragraph f and that led us to contracts <e> <s> the debate on paragraph g led to discussion of a national health service review by my right honourable friend the prime minister which apparently could be introduced under paragraph f <e> <s> now bills of dollars could be introduced under paragraph h <e>", "<cs> i oppose these amendments for three reasons <e> <s> first they are impossible <e> <s> there is no way in which one can guarantee that the admission of <e>", "<cs> from this side of the committee it is a pleasure for once to he able to agree entirely with what the noble lord lord winstanley said about voluntary bodies <e> <s> i was rather surprised to hear that there were any problems arising because i should have thought that it was very bad management that did not take note of what voluntary organisations wanted to contribute and did not consult them in the manner of their contribution <e> <s> i can truthfully say that at least half of the high-tech equipment in my department is provided by charity <e> <s> it is not provided by the national health service as such <e> <s> without such enormous contributions it would be somewhat difficult to carry on at a level of service that one always hopes can be achieved <e>", "<cs> i object to the amendment on two grounds <e> <s> the first is that it sets up yet more councils and committees <e> <s> we are inundated with councils committees sub-committees sub-councils special committees <e>", "<cs> we are discussing or we have been discussing two different things in all the speeches put forward <e> <s> the first thing was the question of charges and their deterrent effect <e> <s> that has been referred to in general terms <e> <s> the proposition that has been put forward is a perfectly tenable one <e> <s> it was that there should be no charges whatsoever on any of these things <e> <s> that is a perfectly acceptable understandable and tenable position <e> <s> it is one i do not happen to share because i believe that there is no reason why those who cannot make some contribution should <e>", "<cs> offhand i do not think that i can answer that question <e> <s> perhaps there ought to be <e> <s> however i was making the point that there are many tests for which one might institute charges with a much better return <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord is a brave man <e> <s> not many politicians would come to either house and confess that they had recently had their mouths examined <e>", "<cs> we seem to be going round in circles as my noble friend said <e> <s> it is true that screening is useful and that we wish to encourage people to attend for eye tests <e> <s> earlier today the committee agreed that they should remain free of charge <e> <s> the noble lord lord winstanley who moved that amendment said that it encouraged people to go and have eye tests <e>", "<cs> it is somewhat of a pleasure for me to be able to support an amendment moved by the noble lord <e> <s> whether it has exactly the correct wording i am not sure but i support the principle of nurse prescribing certainly for the simpler preparations <e> <s> it has not perhaps escaped the attention of some noble lords who attend health <e>", "<cs> i feel that the noble lord has spoken to some extent about penalties rather than the cover of the clause <e> <s> in some ways i agree with him on that point <e> <s> as i am probably the member of the committee who lives nearest to mr van hoogstraten i must say that i have absolutely no sympathy or any defence to offer for such activities <e> <s> i should like to see such activities curtailed in every possible way <e> <s> nevertheless if one refers to page line five of the bill one will see that it provides part of an answer to the points made by the noble lord lord mcintosh <e>", "<cs> precisely <e> <s> the noble lord has intervened from a sitting position <e> <s> i agree that they are frightened <e> <s> that is an unacceptable situation <e> <s> however i am not sure that the amendments which are proposed will help the situation very much <e> <s> much of what has been said in relation to the amendments is covered by the lines which i have mentioned <e>", "<cs> i understand the point which the noble lord has made <e> <s> however he gave an example of a landlord who was fined <e> <s> that amount relative to the cost of property was trivial <e> <s> i therefore believed that he was emphasising penalties rather than stopping harassment <e> <s> i am sure that all of us would like to achieve that <e> <s> i re-emphasise the point that there is difficulty in framing legislation to achieve what we all wish to achieve at the same time that we help the housing market in general terms <e>", "<cs> is it not true referring to rents in the private sector that it would depend on to whom the tenancy was let <e> <s> the circumstances described by the noble baroness unfortunate though they may be would apply to the original letting of the tenancy <e> <s> if this were to both then it would apply to the deserted wife <e> <s> if it is not in both names it would not and could not be so certainly not in the present circumstances <e> <s> if that is to what the noble baroness refers surely that is how it applies <e> <s> is that not correct <e>", "<cs> i am a little puzzled by what the noble lord is saying and seek clarification of some of his points <e> <s> first he accepts i take it that the bill does not apply to existing tenancies <e> <s> i believe that that is common ground <e> <s> secondly the noble lord said quite rightly that when demand is much higher than supply prices tend to rise <e> <s> in general economic terms he is absolutely correct about that <e> <s> however if the purpose of the provision is to increase supply although the noble lord is obsessed with inner london to which he referred five times in his speech i can assure him that many other parts of the country have housing problems the increase in supply must be encouraged to level off demand <e> <s> i accept his argument that new tenancy rates may rise <e> <s> i accept his argument that where long-term tenancies fall in the landlord may prefer to use shorthold tenancies <e> <s> however i do not take the main argument in his speech first because the increase in supply is one of the main objects of the bill secondly because once that increase in supply is achieved it affects the level of demand and thirdly because this does not apply to the whole of london and does not apply to existing tenancies <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just say something about two points which have been made <e> <s> i cannot believe the figures that have just been quoted by the noble lord lord dean of beswick <e> <s> i know he quoted from an answer but he did not specify the question which was tabled <e> <s> if the figure was nationwide i find it impossible to believe that that was the actual figure <e> <s> secondly if he is referring to any new assured shorthold tenancies that cannot be true <e> <s> i must have signed nearly that many in the past eight years <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to be unsympathetic either to single parent families or spouses of broken marriages <e> <s> however there is considerable difficulty in the practical application of the amendments <e> <s> what is being advocated is a form of social letting whereby a private landlord who makes a private let agreement with a tenant also enters into obligations which are unwritten and unthought of with regard to a spouse a family a broken marriage and so on <e> <s> all of that would not normally enter into a landlords consideration of a straightforward economic or financial transaction <e>", "<cs> there is a significant difference <e> <s> i believe that as regards house purchases one of the reasons for employing a lawyer and this will appeal to the noble lord is to ascertain what hazards or difficulties may lie in the way <e> <s> for example there may be a right of way across the property or a right of access by a number of authorities <e> <s> that is why searches are undertaken <e> <s> those are entirely different matters <e>", "<cs> i said nothing of the sort <e> <s> if the noble lord took a tenancy with me and then decided to marry one wife divorce her and marry two more it would be nothing to do with me <e> <s> he is my tenant and i am his landlord or vice versa <e> <s> however if i sign a contract with the noble lord which creates a tenant and landlord situation and the noble lord then marries two or three other people even one will do and decides of his own volition to leave the lady he may then say the tenancy that i signed with you should now be transferred to her <e> <s> in those circumstances it would be perfectly reasonable if the agreement had been signed in their joint names <e> <s> however he is asking landlords to undertake duties which they would not normally expect to undertake when they sign an agreement with a single tenant <e>", "<cs> that equally is rubbish if i may say so <e> <s> the noble lord is trying to put words into my mouth <e> <s> i did not say and he knows perfectly well that i did not say that a person who has signed a tenancy agreement cannot change his social circumstances <e> <s> i am saying that if a person contracts for one particular obligation he should not automatically be expected to have contracted for two three or four other circumstances <e> <s> that is all neither more or less <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord permit me to intervene <e> <s> in the amendment it is proposed that there should be a written obligation on the landlord to take action which he would not presently have to take under an ordinary lease <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the noble lord lord mcintosh one question about this matter <e> <s> i believe that i fully understood his argument <e> <s> how long does he feel would he a reasonable time in respect of the landlords difficulties with regard to rent arrears as opposed to the tenants difficulty in keeping up with his rent <e> <s> they should be balanced out <e> <s> in this instance under this schedule it is three months <e> <s> if he believes that that is unreasonable as a length of time what length of time does he suggest is reasonable before someone goes to court or does he think that the matter should never go to the court and that some discretion should always be used <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i think that the noble lord may have misunderstood my point <e> <s> i understand what he was saying <e> <s> i referred to the weeks as it happens to be in the bill as it stands <e> <s> what i was asking the noble lord is bearing in mind the problems which small landlords in particular might face is it not better to put it another way to clarify the issue by putting in some specific date to show when it becomes virtually mandatory <e> <s> it seems to me that when one starts to refer to the discretion of courts in the private sector of letting one can frequently be absolutely ruining the landlord under these circumstances <e>", "<cs> there is a slight contradiction in what members opposite have been saying <e> <s> i understand that many of them do not like the concept of market rents and a free market in housing <e> <s> fair enough <e> <s> however for those who feel that the bill may make a contribution to an increase in general housing stock and help to alleviate the shortage it seems unfortunate to put too many trip-wires in the way of those who might otherwise be tempted to bring forward part or all of their own properties for rental <e> <s> i do not have in mind an enormous company owning hundreds of flats <e> <s> i have in mind the smaller landlord <e>", "<cs> someone is shouting ministry of transport <e> <s> that may be so as well <e> <s> there may be an equivalent or even larger number of properties with local authorities <e> <s> the bill is trying to increase the amount of housing stock that is available for the purpose of housing people <e> <s> one of the ways of encouraging one end of the spectrum the private sector to bring housing onto the market is by making the market as free as possible <e>", "<cs> i have sympathy with the amendment because it always concerns me when a court does not have freedom of action with regard to a penalty that it imposes in other words the penalty is mandatory <e> <s> that has two effects <e> <s> the first is that a court is much less likely to find for the aggrieved party merely because in its view the penalty is totally disproportionate <e> <s> it may therefore be inclined to say that it is better not to impose a massive penalty on a landlord and to leave the tenant as he is because everyone will have had a warning <e> <s> thus the purpose of the clause would be defeated and the law would be brought into disrepute which is never a terribly good thing to happen <e>", "<cs> my lords i spoke previously in support of the amendment passed in this house benefiting nurses <e> <s> if i have any comment to make on the amendment now before the house it is that it does not go far enough <e> <s> i cannot understand why the government have consistently been a little mean-handed with this branch of a respected profession <e> <s> i have heard arguments to the contrary but it seems to me that there is a distinction between the student nurse and the nurse who will move into the situation of full-time education and other trainees if one wishes to use that word <e> <s> perhaps i may point out that the nursing profession itself does not like the use of the term trainees <e> <s> nonetheless they are in training in one sense or another <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i cannot follow the noble baroness with her detailed knowledge of sandwell but if she gives her attention to clause she will discover that a resolution of the house has to be taken on this matter and that would be the appropriate occasion to hear in detail about the interesting area to which she referred and described verbally <e> <s> i understand she will leave pictures of that area in the library and elsewhere <e>", "<cs> on the noble lords last point there is an appeal both to the secretary of state and to this house on the establishment of hats as there is on the establishment of the proposal <e> <s> to take his first point i believe that there is much in what he said about high rise flats causing many of the problems <e> <s> i presume that the argument at that time would have gone something like this we do not have enough land to invade the green belt and we shall go upwards instead of outwards <e> <s> i always felt that that was a daft argument <e>", "<cs> i take the point and support the argument put forward by the noble lord lord cocks <e> <s> he has a point <e> <s> i remember his floating the idea earlier in the year and there is much to be said for it <e> <s> my difficulty would be the position that he has chosen to try to move this amendment namely in terms of clause at line on page <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may suggest that he is speaking on a slightly different point from that of this amendment which does not necessarily apply to university accommodation <e> <s> only approximately one-third of students at a university are accommodated on campus and that is the part that is used for conferences and so on <e>", "<cs> if i may take up the point which was made and return to the specific amendments i have some sympathy with the arguments put forward by those who have moved the amendments but the weakness of the particular way in which they have been written <e> <s> apart from anything which my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls said is that they are asking for two things to happen <e> <s> one is for an open-ended commitment which is always very difficult to give wisely in such a large field and secondly to perpetuate some of the problems which have arisen over the years in the field of renting namely distortions <e>", "<cs> my lords in many respects i have sympathy with the argument put forward by the noble lord lord ennals that this subsection should be omitted <e> <s> i am in something of a quandary on the matter <e> <s> as the subsection stands it certainly gives new and sweeping powers to the secretary of state which seem to me to be due in part to some confusion on the part of those who drafted the original legislation on the legal questions of patent law crown copyright and the rights to intellectual property <e> <s> be that as it may the purpose of this subsection indeed of the clause is to provide means by which additional resources and funds can be provided for the national health service <e> <s> i do not disagree with this aim <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will give way before he sits down <e> <s> as i understand it and i wonder whether this is his understanding my noble friend the minister has just said or i think i heard him say that it is not his amendment so it is not for him to decide whether or not the house divides but that he will take this paragraph back and bring back a different paragraph at third reading when it will be for this house to decide whether or not that is acceptable <e> <s> if that is what the noble lord is saying and i believe i am right in suggesting that this is the only thing he can say on someone elses amendment perhaps that would help to meet the noble lords point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to my noble friend for his helpful remarks about looking again at paragraph f and his agreement also to look at it in so far as it affected the other paragraphs in any way though of course they do quite clearly apply to subsection <e> <s> under those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the amendment <e> <s> although it may not carry us much further forward in certain respects with regard to some of the subjects discussed by noble lords on report it goes some way in terms of clarification <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to indulge in a long argument about patent law with the noble lord which i would doubtless lose but i do not believe that the amendment makes any difference to the rights of the individual under the patents act nor do i believe that it has any effect upon the rights of compensation or the appointment of arbitrators nor does it need another place to alter it and nor does it need any further question to be raised about the appointment of an arbitrator <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether we are not wandering slightly wide of the amendment and the purposes of this clause <e> <s> i agree with every word of the noble earl <e> <s> lord russell <e> <s> i agree entirely with freedom of publication <e> <s> in fact i think that it is the most important single aspect of research <e> <s> it is the lifeblood of an academic and researcher to follow wherever his work should lead him and he should have the right to publish that work <e> <s> it is as much his lifeblood as the greenback is the lifeblood of the banker <e> <s> people should appreciate how deeply this issue is felt among research workers and those in universities medical schools and similar institutions <e> <s> i share their views <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his comments and i also thank all noble lords for supporting me today in moving this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot understand part of the noble lords argument <e> <s> if one were making an application one would wish to know not only the statistical distribution of arrears of rent but the types of arrears of rent that might arise <e> <s> under these circumstances the application or the intentions might be changed <e> <s> in other words the information might influence the written intentions of the applicant <e> <s> it does not seem unreasonable to know what one is likely to be bidding for <e>", "<cs> my lords there is quite considerable consideration before the first step of the application is taken <e> <s> though it may apply to applications every public sector body and local authority would know that this step was coming <e> <s> what my noble friend the minister said may well have been correct <e> <s> the application is not going to be the first step taken by any putative private landlord <e> <s> the other point made by the noble lord would be covered by the regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may ask him a question for clarification purposes <e> <s> as i understand it he has really asked three questions in one <e> <s> first he is asking what happens in an average circumstance in an average house not at the top end of the housing market or anything like that where a market rent is set by the rent officer which is the guideline for the issue of housing benefit by the local authority <e> <s> i think that he made the point in regard to the previous amendment <e> <s> i believe that the minister stated in reply that one of the reasons for making the guideline was so that it would be quite impossible for an astronomical rent to be set and for astronomical housing benefit automatically to follow <e> <s> i take it that in this particular instance he is not referring to that issue and that he appreciates the point <e>", "<cs> my lords when debating a similar amendment last week i did not agree on the grounds that we would reduce the adapted housing stock and discriminate against those who did not have housing for the disabled <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i quite follow my noble and learned friends answer on why part v should not be included <e> <s> even if an emergency order lasts only eight days it has a significant effect on the life of a family and on the life of a child <e> <s> no one would disagree with that <e> <s> i find it hard to believe that anyone would issue an order without looking at and taking account of in whatever statutory form or obligatory form the so-called checklist <e> <s> everyone will agree with the checklist <e> <s> surely those issuing an emergency order will be checking from a to g with <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to come back to this point again but the noble and learned lord lord hailsham and the noble lord who has just spoken talk about an interim order an order that can last eight days <e> <s> surely one of the lessons of cleveland is that too much speed was shoved into this without sufficient consideration in many respects <e> <s> i cannot see what harm there is in writing into the clause that those concerned should look through the checklist <e> <s> that is a reasonable protection <e> <s> an interim order it may well be interim has a devastating impact on the family and on all concerned <e> <s> every possible protection should be considered <e> <s> one should not dismiss it by saying that it is only an interim order <e> <s> an interim order can affect the whole life of the person concerned <e>", "<cs> before my noble and learned friend sits down perhaps he could enlighten me on one point <e> <s> i am probably being very stupid but why is the provision under this subsection confined to these two particular categories of person from whom the court may or shall require a report <e>", "<cs> excuse my pursuing this matter further but does a local authority stand in that relationship with the court any more than other people <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to my noble friend for her comment <e> <s> i was wondering whether this is exclusive <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord can understand the point that if one makes an application whether for leave or an actual application or any other manoeuvre it is likely to cause disruption to the person in regard to whom that application is made irrespective of whether it is successful unsuccessful justified unjustified or anything else <e> <s> the mere fact that it has happened causes the disruption <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment which considers the effect function or consequence of the handicap rather than a list of ailments if i may so call them blind deaf dumb and so forth all of which are themselves subject to variable definition <e> <s> a deaf child does not have to be stone deaf to be deaf and <e>", "<cs> i do not disagree at all with what the noble baroness said <e> <s> i am convinced that there arc problems and that they need to be addressed <e> <s> i am quite convinced from all the evidence that i see and come across that there are a large number of people in that age group who for various reasons and i am not simply concerned with children who are discharged from care are getting into some difficulties <e> <s> perhaps the most needed change in social security is some flexibility <e> <s> there has always been some anxiety expressed by your lordships that at the time of the passage of the bill and the regulations a great deal of flexibility was lost with the introduction of such rigid criteria plus changes to the social fund which was essentially a loan fund <e>", "<cs> i have every sympathy with the intention behind the amendment but one or two points about it concern me <e> <s> first i should have suspected that if the paramount consideration is always that of the childs welfare that might well be covered by clause i where the paramountcy of the childs welfare would be taken into consideration in the type of accommodation that should be provided in the circumstances <e> <s> therefore i doubt whether this adds much to it <e>", "<cs> before going any further we have had two quite different bases for arguing about this amendment <e> <s> the first was what is referred to as defective eyesight which can mean a large number of things <e> <s> i think it would be nice to know i am not certain myself what is actually proposed in terms of the test <e> <s> there are a large number of conditions of the eye some of which are of course not correctable although the term uncorrected is used <e> <s> secondly we have had the phrase medical examination used in rather the same terms <e> <s> they are of course different things and apart from the burden this would impose upon opticians doctors or anybody else that is to say the administrative burden and the administration in the form of the licensing authorities has already been mentioned there is also the definition of precisely what test one would be passing <e> <s> for example the normal thing about reading registration plates at a distance anybody can check for themselves and most people know whether or not they can see well at a distance or whether they cannot read the london telephone directory because their arm is not long enough which is a pretty good test of certain problems <e> <s> but the fact remains that there are many other things that may not be detected on an ordinary test <e> <s> so i would ask what depth of test is actually envisaged by this term uncorrected vision <e> <s> i think that is important and perhaps it ought not to be confused with the term medical examination which of course is much wider <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my pleasant duty and a great pleasure on behalf of your lordships house to congratulate the noble lord lord butterfield on his maiden speech <e> <s> he brings to our debate in this field a very wide and long experience and an enormous expertise from a distinguished career <e> <s> i suppose that for most people to be a professor in one institution is enough to be a professor in three and a vice-chancellor of two universities and also a regius professor would seem to be almost excessive <e> <s> we are delighted that he has contributed to our debate tonight <e> <s> i hope as i am sure do the rest of your lordships that the noble lord will contribute again <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask my noble friend if he can to reassure us on a point which i think will concern a lot of people namely there is the possibility raised in the rather short outline of the white paper that he has given that hospital services going under the hospitals trusts could lead to a two-tier hospital service <e> <s> i am sure he will agree that one of the great functions of the national health service over years has been to disseminate talent and equality of care and good care all over the country <e> <s> can he reassure us that this will not be reversed that this process which has gone on for years will continue and that there will be no question of two-tier-type hospital services <e>", "<cs> my lords i also support the idea of research into any causation of accidents including visual acuity and other eye defects <e> <s> my anxiety about this amendment is that it would involve so many of the general medical examinations that apply to public service vehicle and heavy goods vehicle licence-holders at age and thereafter <e> <s> if one multiplies the number of drivers in those age groups it means that someone presumably the doctor has to carry out literally millions of tests and fill in millions of forms which will be a great load for people who are not driving in a commercial i believe that the term used was vocational sense <e> <s> for that reason the proposal seems unrealistic <e> <s> that is a pity because the first part of the amendment which requires research as the noble baroness lady gardner has just said is absolutely correct and something that one would support <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support a great deal of what has been said by my noble friend lady gardner <e> <s> everyone will agree that we wish to prevent accidents and if this is a proven means of doing so it should be encouraged to the hilt <e> <s> we need to encourage research into accident prevention and health-related problems <e>", "<cs> my lords i also support my noble friends amendment <e> <s> all the arguments have been adduced and i do not need to add to them except as regards one point that puzzles me <e> <s> if the law has been so acceptable for some time in one part of the united kingdom where it appears to have had some measure of success judged by the experience of the ruc why is such a measure so resisted in other parts of the united kingdom <e> <s> my noble friend may be able to tell me that there are plenty of powers that we already have that cover the possibility of introducing such measures under secondary legislation or by some other means <e> <s> i record my support for the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble lord lord hunter of newington for introducing the debate which i thoroughly welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords there have been many inquiries into the national health service and there is a mass of information available <e> <s> i should have thought that the review had done rather well to have got as far as this in the time that it has <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may finish this point i shall certainly give way to the noble lord <e> <s> we have needed some kind of reform and that is what we have been considering <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point and i understood it <e> <s> one of the major objectives of reducing waiting is the social cost of such operations which is what the noble lord is referring to <e> <s> this is one of the most important elements in the national health service but it is not the direct audited cost of that which happens within national health services premises no <e>", "<cs> in one moment <e> <s> my lords they may do so <e> <s> therefore i emphasise that it is a matter <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be impossible to decide to opt out if any of the large segments of working staff within a hospital were against doing so <e> <s> i could not operate a self-governing hospital without the consent of the nurses the staff the doctors and the administrators <e> <s> it would not work it would have to remain more or less the same <e> <s> many may do so for the good reason that for once they have corrected the membership and organisation of the district health authority <e>", "<cs> he must have been on this side of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords it so happens that the noble lord has chosen my own speciality <e> <s> if he wishes to say that people have died because of the lack of kidney machines which do not cost i should like to know chapter and verse to which patients he refers and the places where they have died <e>", "<cs> surely the argument here is not so much a legal one which seems to be agreed namely that there is a difference between the drug trafficking offences act and this bill <e> <s> i share the view of the noble lord lord harris that it is a pity that the measure is not in the drug trafficking offences act for the same reason that it is an equally unpleasant and offensive activity <e>", "<cs> my lords as one of those noble lords who on second reading had some reservations about the bill i too congratulate the noble lord lord rea on bringing the measure successfully through this house <e> <s> i do not think that <e>", "<cs> can my noble and learned friend answer one question that might seem a little odd at first sight <e> <s> what action is the commissioner supposed to take if in the course of carrying out his duties under clause he comes across some other irregularity other than that relating to a warrant that it is his immediate duty to investigate <e> <s> it is not clear to me from the clause perhaps i have overlooked the matter what action he would then take <e>", "<cs> i hope i am not being obtuse if i press my noble and learned friend on this matter <e> <s> i was not referring to where the commissioner comes across an irregularity in a warrant which is part of his duty and on which he may report to the prime minister at any time <e> <s> what is the position if in the course of his duty he comes across something that is not part of his duty to review the activities of the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> one could circumvent the proposal very easily merely by using the ordinary police force which is not designated special branch <e> <s> secondly are not complaints against the police subject to a different procedure <e>", "<cs> if one were to accept this amendment it would suggest that the membership of many organisations which might be regarded as dubious to say the least could claim an escape unless directly involved from any form of investigation <e> <s> i am the first to agree with the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones that guilt by association is not acceptable <e> <s> however i would submit that the sub-paragraph is saying in effect that members of an organisation that itself is suspect even though they themselves have not been proven or shown to have done something suspect nevertheless by the fact of their membership of the organisation are reasonably subject to inquiry <e> <s> that in terms of security does not seem to me to be unreasonable <e>", "<cs> i have now sat through the debate on this committee stage for six hours or more <e> <s> i am delighted that this is the first occasion on which i can fully agree with the comments made by the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington <e> <s> i was very puzzled during second reading to hear my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor suggest that because lawyers were most concerned with matters of truth and justice and were most involved with dealing with such matters they were therefore the most appropriate people <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful as i am sure are other members of your lordships house to the noble baroness for introducing this debate <e> <s> she started by saying that her remarks would probably be controversial <e> <s> her speech lived up to that promise in the sense that she made many severe criticisms of the social policy of the government <e> <s> however she was not as radical as i would have been had i ever been in a position to do anything about this matter <e> <s> i shall not pursue that line at the present time simply because i have mentioned it before and each time the minister who was due to reply squashed it quite properly <e> <s> my proposals were always regarded as far too expensive a solution and far too widely tax-based <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not like the noble earl to make a mistake <e> <s> that was not a statement made by the leader of the party but by a then civil servant <e> <s> it is quoted in the book of the noble lord lord rawlinson <e>", "<cs> as always i am nearly persuaded by the able advocacy of the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> once again i began to feel that perhaps he had a strong point <e> <s> i have sympathy with what was said by the noble lord lord jenkins of hillhead about secrecy in the civil service <e> <s> in fact i had sympathy with a good deal of what he had to say <e> <s> however two thoughts came to mind <e> <s> during the second reading debate one of the comments that appealed to all sides of the chamber concerned the balance of the bill <e> <s> it was first raised by my noble friend lord thorneycroft <e> <s> the problem with the amendment is that it tilts the balance of the bill so far that to a large extent great parts of the legislation would become practically meaningless <e> <s> the width of the so-called public interest defence would become so great that almost any advocate one would not need the noble lord lord mishcon or one of the other able advocates on the benches opposite addressing themselves to this matter could put forward a defence to anything a civil servant might wish to do <e>", "<cs> i have a doubt about this amendment in two senses <e> <s> first i am not sure that to qualify the word damage is helpful to anyone in deciding whether whatever they might say is serious <e> <s> if what is said will be damaging in any way then it should not be said <e> <s> if there is a choice between damage and serious damage they may make the wrong choice thinking something was not serious when it was later held to be serious <e> <s> in that sense this amendment might not have the effect that its proposers intend <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak as a potential consumer and also as a member of another profession <e> <s> that profession is also at present under scrutiny and much of what i heard this afternoon and this morning gives me a sense of <e>", "<cs> my lords in a moment <e> <s> the motto here is he who sups with the devil needs a long spoon <e> <s> it is that form of state intervention that may curtail many of the activities of lawyers <e> <s> i do not profess to know the answer as regards middle income legal accessibility <e> <s> for lawyers at least argue about it though they do it is a double-edged weapon of which they should be careful <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to be sidetracked into arguments about how independent are consultants in the national health service <e> <s> i feel independent <e> <s> as i am only half in the national health service and half outside it my independence may or may not be qualified <e>", "<cs> my lords part of the purpose of this bill is to protect official secrets <e> <s> indeed much of our discussion has been about what happens after someone has leaked them <e> <s> however it seems to me that the noble lord lord mishcon would have a much stronger point in putting forward this amendment if this bill covered as many pieces of information many of them minor and such a wide range of people as does the existing act <e> <s> it does not <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to my noble friend <e> <s> i was trying to make the point that the speech of the noble lord lord hunt of tanworth had already been quoted in aid of the amendment <e> <s> i was pointing out that he was covering a much wider field in his second reading speech <e> <s> he went all through the question of going to the senior civil servant to the head of the civil service and to the minister and so on a much wider field than is covered by this amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it would be possible to put to the mover of the amendment the point that it is certainly appropriate to have a representative committee which is really what he is talking about for certain functions <e> <s> but and i feel that he did not answer this question is it appropriate for this type of function <e> <s> i have nothing against having local authority representatives on this body or the others but i have some experience of running committees that are supposed to be independent of any particular interest <e>", "<cs> i shook my head because it seems to me that there is a confusion <e> <s> if one is an owner of land with certain claims on that land and others have certain duties and rights on that land and one sells the land the existing duties and rights do not necessarily change <e> <s> that is the first point <e>", "<cs> i was not going to help <e> <s> i was going to ask my noble friend the minister whether the rather simpler interpretation in the use of these terms which i have just given was accurate or inaccurate because it seemed to me that we are saying the same thing but using different words <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord rises again to speak on the issue i should like quickly to put forward three points <e> <s> first if a concern becomes a private company a plc it is not in the interests of that company to have bad labour relations <e> <s> i believe that he and i agree about that irrespective of other aspects on which we disagree <e> <s> secondly most takeover concerns and in one sense it would be a takeover lead to a better payment for severance call it what you will than usual <e> <s> that is because in terms of labour relations it is the right thing to do and the best thing in the interests of those concerned and of the continuing labour force <e>", "<cs> my lords in congratulating the noble earl on raising this important question i must apologise to the house for having missed the early part of this debate because of an unavoidable time factor <e> <s> i agree very much with the noble lords last words in his tribute to the success of the polytechnics <e> <s> i believe he put it very well indeed and i entirely agree with him on those points <e> <s> i am referring of course to his final words before the intervention <e> <s> they were absolutely correct <e>", "<cs> i am a little puzzled by the amendment because if one reads on to the following line one sees that the money shall be paid by parliament not by the consumer <e> <s> it states that <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down <e>", "<cs> i was about to ask the noble baroness to make some qualification to her statement <e> <s> it seemed to me that her assurance had been misinterpreted or massaged a little <e> <s> i know perfectly well as does the noble lord lord stoddart from many years in another place as well as in this chamber that governments do not make that kind of commitment <e> <s> as it was massaged very ably by the noble lord lord williams i am glad to hear that my noble friend has been able to clarify that point <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord asking that there should be some method of referral by these committees to the monopolies and mergers commission <e> <s> if that is so with respect it does not make sense <e> <s> but if he is talking about whether on request the consumers committees can give evidence then of course they can as can any other body <e> <s> but they cannot initiate a referral which is what the noble lord seems to be implying from his example <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may refer the noble lord to clause which covers some of the points he is asking about <e> <s> it concerns how the director and others may refer matters to the monopolies and mergers commission <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will glance at clauses and and to a lesser extent clause <e> <s> it seems to me that they render the amendment unnecessary <e> <s> it is true that independence is not written in but the independence of the committee depends upon its appointment composition and so forth which we debated earlier <e> <s> if the noble lord looks at those clauses he will see for example that clause states <e>", "<cs> further to what my noble friend says and i agree with what he says if we are to look at subsequent clauses then clause for example outlines the steps that a local authority can take which lead to an order by the secretary of state <e> <s> therefore in one sense the point of the noble lord lord mcintosh may be met <e> <s> in addition the correct channels of procedure would be used <e> <s> that would avoid parallel procedures causing confusion which was one of the other points which was raised <e> <s> however it seems to me that there is a channel by which those could be used <e> <s> as my noble friend said it would confuse the issue not to look at clause on its merits and see when we come to clause as we shall the fact that it gives the local authority those rights <e>", "<cs> i follow the noble lords argument and i think that i understand it but i wonder to what extent the amendments reinforce the powers of the director bearing in mind that he already has certain specific duties under clause which we have already discussed <e> <s> it seems to me that it is unnecessary to include these amendments <e> <s> the noble lord has not convinced me of the need <e>", "<cs> i agree with what the noble lord says about the duties of the director being scattered throughout the bill <e> <s> it would be nice if they were all to be found in one place so that we knew exactly what he is supposed to do <e> <s> however with respect to the noble lord he has not convinced me that the amendments are necessary to reinforce the general duties outlined under clause <e> <s> therefore i cannot see in what way they advance the powers independence or duties of the director <e> <s> that is the point on which i hoped he would persuade me <e>", "<cs> i sympathise with what the noble lord lord mcintosh said about compliance with the ec directives with regard to water supplies and what he said about lead and nitrates <e> <s> those are two examples only <e> <s> i declare an interest because i am more interested in the effect of aluminium <e> <s> it so happens that when in water aluminium causes dementia serious bone disease and so forth in patients with whom i am connected <e> <s> that is neither here nor there <e> <s> it happens to be but a small interest compared with this major measure <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend rises to make another comment is not the committee itself being a little unreasonable <e> <s> the term reasonable is frequently used in legislation <e> <s> it was used in the housing legislation in the legal aid bill and in the gas bill <e> <s> it has been used constantly and everybody knows what it means even if it is difficult to define <e> <s> the noble lord lord howie asked why we should not use a phrase with a different nuance that is not unreasonable <e> <s> unfortunately that is not logical <e> <s> if something is not reasonable it is unreasonable <e> <s> if it is not unreasonable it is reasonable <e> <s> there is no way round that sort of semantic proposition <e> <s> it is not the same as saying not less than because not less than could mean two things more than or the same <e> <s> that is not so with reasonable <e>", "<cs> i wish to comment on two points that have been made <e> <s> the first is that i entirely agree with my noble friend lord renton that it is important for this to be included in the bill <e> <s> it is a significant fact and an important part of the general way in which we live in this country that this matter should be given due consideration <e>", "<cs> no i did not say that <e> <s> i carefully said that only in circumstances where one must make big changes in coal-fired power stations where it were difficult to obtain the coal or where there were transport costs and those costs rise would they approach that of nuclear power <e> <s> in other words nuclear power is at present much more expensive to produce unit for unit <e> <s> i was making that point and was not trying to suggest that it was cheaper nor would it be in the immediate future <e>", "<cs> i am somewhat unhappy about this amendment for two reasons <e> <s> first what company would not look at all the options of how it was to proceed in a major investment particularly the necessity of such an investment before making plans to proceed <e> <s> secondly if it were making plans to proceed it would clearly prefer other things being equal a low cost to a high cost production <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will let me finish <e> <s> thirdly the assumption here is that unless a whole series of probably non-economic reasons and they may be social or environmental are put forward it is assumed that any company would not consider those matters <e> <s> i am querying the necessity for this amendment at all because it strongly suggests to me that the noble lord is saying to a large extent that he would expect people operating those companies to be short-sighted and incompetent <e>", "<cs> assuming that the noble lord is right in what he said about various constaints there is no option anyway <e> <s> in fact that is the point that the noble lord is making <e> <s> all these constraints will force the companies to choose one way or the other irrespective of the economic circumstances <e> <s> therefore it is not a question of low-cost or high-cost but a question of if there are no constraints i must choose x <e> <s> it is hobsons choice <e> <s> my whole argument about the amendment is that if these reasons are true and assuming what the noble lord said is accurate it is unnecessary <e> <s> on the other hand if what the noble lord said is not accurate it is irrelevant <e>", "<cs> i too feel very strongly about the matter <e> <s> as i recall th august is better known in history as the black day of the german army as described by ludendorf <e> <s> it was the day it began its retreat <e> <s> i believe this is a very important question <e> <s> i am deeply concerned that we manage to maintain levels of research and development <e>", "<cs> the noble lord talks about self-regulation being a bad means of carrying out things and that it is an open sesame to cowboys <e> <s> however was he present at question time when <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is saying just that <e> <s> he says that he needs to consult his lawyer before he brings in his plumber in case the latter is not properly registered <e> <s> is not the matter becoming a little farcical <e>", "<cs> i am puzzled by one factor which has been put forward by both benches opposite and that is the assumption that if one meters the amount of water which is consumed it will inevitably cost more than a flat rate <e> <s> it would not be very difficult for a water undertaker to set two rates one a flat rate and one a metered rate <e> <s> the only rate that the consumer could control in any way would be the metered rate <e>", "<cs> with due respect to the noble baroness i am sure that she is right in what she says but one would like to know the basis of this so-called experiment or test <e> <s> is the comparison being made with current water rate charges <e> <s> is it being made on the assumption that wakefield would charge a <e>", "<cs> my noble friend was far more athletic than i and was on his feet in a flash <e> <s> the reason why i asked a specific question was not because it was relevant to whether you have choice <e> <s> i always tend to favour choice when this can be exercised <e> <s> my view is that in practical terms exactly what the noble lord has described is going to arise <e>", "<cs> i very readily accept the description which the noble lord lord ross gave when he said that the amendments were a fallback position <e> <s> it seems to me however that they have probably been very effectively superseded even in the noble lords own mind by the statement made by my noble friend on the front bench about minutes ago <e> <s> it appears to me that the rules of the contest at the moment have been slightly changed and that therefore we have to recalculate the sums <e> <s> as i understand it the proposals put forward by my noble friend represent one of the possible solutions to a problem which it appears some members of the committee do not wish to consider <e> <s> that problem is that one way or another some billions of pounds will have to be found in the future <e>", "<cs> i did not misunderstand the noble lords argument at all <e> <s> i know his argument about public investment and public service <e> <s> i do not particularly wish to prolong this debate <e> <s> however i must say that i conceded this very point <e> <s> i recognise where the noble lord stands on this matter <e> <s> i also recognise that one of the great difficulties is that so long as one depends upon public investment the same situation will occur with water as has occurred previously a per cent <e> <s> cut in that so-called investment <e> <s> that is what happened in the late s for all sorts of no doubt at the time excellent reasons such as economic pressures <e> <s> i do not wish to make a specific party point on the matter but it is a fact that that is what has happened in public investment in this particular public service <e> <s> therefore one has to look at other solutions to the problem <e>", "<cs> i wish to add my support for the amendment which i think is a good one <e> <s> i personally reject the evidence given and comments made by the noble earl lord baldwin as i think the case for fluoridation has been well proven on a number of scores <e> <s> i therefore support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords despite the passionate intervention of the noble lord lord ross it is clear that the case which my noble friend lord renton made against the amendment stands <e> <s> it is impractical and if i may use the word somewhat stupid <e> <s> it must be absolutely evident that the national rivers authority will have to do this not only for the transitional period mentioned in the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down he said just now that it was contradictory to free the number of employees but to control the remuneration terms and all the rest of it <e> <s> we had the example of cars <e> <s> in many circumstances in the public sector or the quasi-public sector numbers are very often not dictated by the treasury although they are paid by the treasury where the total global sum is distributed by the authority concerned usually on a fixed rate of the basis of remuneration terms and conditions but not specifying numbers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord again but with respect what he is saying is not so <e> <s> this is the method by which large parts of the public sector expenditure are controlled <e>", "<cs> my lords i seem to have a sense of <e>", "<cs> my lords i have only one quick point to make especially as i know that the noble lord lord mcintosh trusts neither doctors nor lawyers <e> <s> the amendments that he proposes so tighten the activities which can be carried on that we run the risk that the undertakers would only be able to do those things which conserve the environment flora and fauna and so forth <e> <s> i understand the point of the amendments <e> <s> but surely there is a risk of the wording being so tight that it becomes self-defeating <e> <s> for that reason i have some reservations about the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i share many of the sentiments expressed by my noble friend lord renton with two reservations <e> <s> the first is a purely practical one namely that facilities change <e> <s> what may be appropriate at the present time may not fall into a development which takes place subsequently after the water companies have taken over <e> <s> it would concern me if the proposal was put on the face of the bill in this way or if the subsection was left out in other words if either of the alternatives in amendments nos <e> <s> a or was adopted <e> <s> it could restrict plans or operations which might be introduced for recreational purposes i am not talking about profit or the delivery of the service but simply about recreational and other facilities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> i think he did not quite answer the point that i for one have raised in pointing out that there is a grey area around these matters <e> <s> off the top of my head i can give one example <e> <s> let us suppose that there is a rather low-grade car park in a field for which no charge is made <e> <s> it is sited alongside a reservoir where swimming or whatever is allowed to develop <e> <s> if that car park is upgraded and a facility is put alongside it may be difficult to say whether a charge should be made <e> <s> it is indeed the same car <e>", "<cs> my lords i have great sympathy with the amendments and the intention behind them which is the elimination of discrimination <e> <s> i accept what my noble friend lord stanley and the noble lords lord ezra and lord mcintosh said <e> <s> where i am left somewhat confused is whether this will be the effect of these amendments <e> <s> underlying the amendments has been the intention to protect against discrimination rural consumers of water <e> <s> if the amendments were to be put on the face of the bill as i read it it is possible that the people who would then be disadvantaged are the urban communities <e> <s> that is a risk that we have to bear in mind <e> <s> if the purpose of the amendments is to remove discrimination on the cost of water supply it is not much good removing it from rural consumers and handing it over excessively to urban consumers <e> <s> that appears to be a possibility in the light of the wording of the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i support my noble friend lord renton in putting the amendment forward if the argument he has deployed with regard to what we might call secondary charging is valid under subsections and <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend assures me that he has it right on this occasion too <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a perfectly valid point that improvement of the verbiage of these particular subsections may be possible <e> <s> however groucho marx also said that he would not be prepared to belong to any club that would accept him as a member <e>", "<cs> my lords i spoke briefly on this matter in committee <e> <s> as that was as the noble lord lord monson pointed out at an unearthly hour i was extremely brief and possibly slightly sharp with the noble earl for which i now apologise <e> <s> i think i was unduly sharp in making my comments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most obliged to my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> i think that it goes a very long way to produce the assurance which was the purpose of this amendment <e> <s> i therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords does not my noble friend agree that it has been widely welcomed that the resource management initiative will help very considerably to answer the question as regards the true level of funding as well as the true required level of funding so that future discussions on this subject <e>", "<cs> i have a slight anxiety about these amendments in that they are confusing <e> <s> they certainly follow on from what my noble friend on the front bench has said but there is a difference between energy generation and energy saving <e> <s> of course i agree with the noble lord lord ezra that it is necessary to stimulate energy efficiency programmes and energy saving <e> <s> i do not argue with that <e> <s> the argument i have with this series of amendments is simply that we are including that which is not generation with that which is for example in amendment no <e> <s> subsection a refers to <e>", "<cs> i have some reservations about this matter <e> <s> very simply they are related to treaty rights <e> <s> it seems to me that it is extremely unlikely that whatever the intrinsic merits of the amendment from the point of view of the british nuclear industry and so forth it conforms to treaty rights <e> <s> i do not have the connections or the knowledge in this field of the members of the committee who have just spoken but of course from the point of view of the industry as my noble friend lord peyton has just said it might be very beneficial in some respects particularly for the british nuclear industry and to pass the amendment would encourage it in some ways <e>", "<cs> i support the nuclear power industry too <e> <s> however the noble lord is saying that the way to support that industry is to give it some kind of special protection <e> <s> that is contrary to what will probably be required under the rights of the treaty within two-and-a-half years time <e>", "<cs> it seems that the noble lord has put one or two words into my noble friends mouth <e> <s> as i understand it she stated that today when electricity supply is in the public sector if one buys one unit of electricity at a cost of say p to make matters simple under the system on which the levy was introduced the cost of one unit of electricity to the consumer would still be p <e> <s> the difference would be that it would be declared more accurately to be a cost of p from fossil fuels and a cost of p from nuclear power <e> <s> however the total cost to the consumer would be unchanged <e> <s> in other words the total bill is unchanged <e> <s> there is now to be identification of the cost from fossil fuels and the cost from non-fossil fuels <e>", "<cs> i take the point that the noble lord is making <e> <s> obviously my noble friend will say whether or not she thought that words were being put into her mouth <e> <s> i thought she was saying that the total cost to the consumer would not be different <e>", "<cs> may i draw the noble lords attention to the fact that the whole clause from subsection where the director may down to subsection where it states <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i should like to put a point to him <e> <s> this situation is not altogether different from the custom in most public sector authorities <e> <s> it is similar to an internal complaints procedure that does not preclude a citizens rights before the courts at common law or under any other statute <e> <s> it refers only to the decision made by the director under these specific circumstances <e> <s> therefore it does not rule out the right of the citizen to appeal to a court on other grounds relative to compensation <e>", "<cs> my lords i have every sympathy with and understand the anxieties expressed most eloquently by the noble lord lord graham of edmonton <e> <s> we all know that there are problems concerned with football and no one doubts that <e> <s> the debates which have taken place on the bill have been concerned with dealing with those problems and the noble lord contributed materially <e> <s> i deny the remarks made earlier by the noble lord lord hatch that no one from this side of the house had criticised or commented on the bill <e> <s> some noble lords who did so are present <e>", "<cs> i wish to ask the noble lord one question <e> <s> he said there was no other system upon which this matter could be operated except that of marginal cost on which it has been operated <e> <s> will he explain to me why he thinks that it could not be operated on any other cost system <e> <s> part of the reason for the provision is the high basic cost of nuclear stations <e> <s> will the noble lord explain to me why he makes that statement when there are other cost bases on which to operate <e>", "<cs> i have some amusement in one sense in following the noble lord lord joseph who preceded my noble friend because years ago i think i made his speech in another place and he got up and rejected it <e> <s> he may not recall the occasion but at that time and subsequently i have not seen any reason to change my point of view the failure to tie together the insurance scheme the taxation system and the benefits system led to these complications where there are so many winners and losers when benefits are changed <e> <s> he described the welfare archipelago which arises <e> <s> one gets into a tangle <e> <s> it may look like a perfectly straightforward system but when one increases something like child benefit in the end you have to reduce another benefit under the family credit scheme by the same amount as the noble lord pointed out <e>", "<cs> i have listened to this exchange with interest and some fascination <e> <s> am i right in thinking that when a claimant is warned and as that case goes to the adjudicator the benefit ceases but that if it is decided subsequently by the adjudicator that the warning was invalid so to speak the benefit is restored for that period of time <e> <s> then of course benefit will continue <e> <s> if however the adjudicator decides that the claimant was unjustified he does not get any benefit <e> <s> the point which was discussed at cross purposes was that the decision is taken before the adjudicator has decided and only if he decides in favour of the claimant is that period then restored to the claimant <e> <s> i think that was the point that the noble baroness and my noble friend on my <e>", "<cs> the noble lord quite accurately said that he wandered broadly over the subject but he did not address or justify the wording of his amendment <e> <s> he talked at great length about the propriety or otherwise of advertising in the press or on television <e> <s> he has a point but there is a difficult line to draw between public service advertising advertising in the sense that one is preparing for a flotation however that may be spelt and what one might call direct pr from the point of view of image building for the post-privatisation image of the successor companies <e> <s> however this is not what the amendment refers to <e>", "<cs> in answer to the point just made i believe that it is fair to draw my noble friends attention to paragraph of schedule where it is clear that there must be a resolution of the other place <e> <s> i believe that the nod and a wink that he was requesting is probably taken care of <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to keep the house at this late hour but i believe that certain statements made from the opposition benches have really rather exaggerated the situation <e> <s> the speech of the noble lord lord mcintosh began by implying that nothing is happening now yet we have heard endlessly during the proceedings on the bill that improvements are even now taking place <e> <s> further investment is taking place and various examples <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not dream of attempting to rival the noble lord lord callaghan in his knowledge of the docks <e> <s> however perhaps i may remind him of a fact of which i think he is aware which is that i was one of the backstops of the medical services which were offered in part of the london docks for many years <e> <s> therefore i was familiar with the docks <e> <s> i first worked in the docks shortly after the introduction of the national dock labour scheme <e> <s> that was of course also shortly after the introduction of the national health service <e> <s> both those schemes made a considerable practical difference as regards the development of medical services <e> <s> the national health service made a general difference which applied to all sectors of the community <e> <s> however the facilities provided under the national dock labour scheme undoubtedly improved the medical facilities in the docks <e> <s> there was no question about that <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is a bit quick to say hear hear as i am just about to disagree with him totally in his interpretation of this amendment <e> <s> i agree that clause seems to suggest that the transitional period is to be decided by the secretary of state <e> <s> whatever one may think of any particular secretary of state or of any particular government one must assume that if they set out on a particular course they do not at the same time put mine fields all the way up the road ahead of them to blow themselves up <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to pursue the tremendously general comments made by the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon <e> <s> i feel that they were exaggerated in the sense that the actions of trade unionists here and their treatment here are not truly comparable with the treatment of solidarity a few years ago <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord knows that <e>", "<cs> i have great sympathy with large parts of the amendment the aims are entirely laudable <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend lady faithfull as i do with members of the committee who have spoken from the other benches that there are difficult and serious problems that we have to tackle <e> <s> what concerns me is whether the amendment produces a suitable answer in this field <e> <s> what i mean is that as i understand it and as i read the amendment and i am sure that somebody will correct me if i am wrong the basic aim is to revert to the old system <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble lord i do not believe i said that <e> <s> i was trying to say that we knew the defects of the previous system <e> <s> i did not say that nothing should be done <e> <s> i was merely suggesting that we should ensure that we do the right thing whereas previously we were not doing the right thing <e> <s> it was known that under the previous <e>", "<cs> i have a feeling that the noble baroness has answered her own questions to some extent <e> <s> irrespective of the points she was making about the worthiness of the war widows and the war pensioners which i accept and entirely endorse if i read the amendment correctly it suggests to me that the discrepancy will be perpetuated rather than evened out <e> <s> as i understand it the noble baroness is moving the amendment to try to even out the discrepancy <e> <s> the wording of the amendment suggests to me that that discrepancy would continue and that the distress that that caused would be continued <e> <s> i believe the wording needs to be changed <e>", "<cs> i may have misread the terms of the amendment <e> <s> i take the point that the noble baroness has made <e> <s> i think i was looking at an earlier draft of the amendment <e> <s> i apologise if i have made an error <e> <s> however i think the amendment does not change the fact that any disregard as regards housing benefit still depends upon income <e> <s> that makes a considerable difference <e> <s> the matter is also left to the local authority concerned as that is the authority which pays the further disregard at the present time <e> <s> the disregard is paid centrally <e> <s> therefore as i think the noble baroness said the matter becomes rather more complicated than it appears on the face of it <e> <s> i believe too that one should look at this matter further <e> <s> however i question whether this amendment will achieve the objectives that the noble baroness quite laudably sets out <e>", "<cs> my lords i have some anxiety about these amendments on two grounds <e> <s> first in a number of different places in the bill the statement is made that electricity shall be provided without discrimination <e> <s> clause a for example states that the prices charged to tariff customers shall not <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down i wish to ask whether the point is covered by paragraph c which states that <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not disgree with the comments made by my noble friend lord norrie or the noble lord lord ezra <e> <s> i would be the last to suggest that the environment is not of overwhelming importance it needs to be mentioned in the bill and as my noble friend said not lost in a schedule <e> <s> i do not wish to prejudge any discussions that we may have subsequently on schedule but i am concerned that i am not sure what this amendment actually means <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the noble lord lord mcintosh on the way in which he presented the proposed new clause <e> <s> i also associate the noble lord lord ezra in those congratulations for his remarks because they are indeed seductive <e> <s> however i prefer to address myself to the amendment and its consequences rather than to an argument about the wholesomeness of water <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall give way in a moment <e> <s> it effectively takes away from the secretary of state that is not immediately apparent but it is apparent if one reads carefully between the lines of the amendment powers with regard to the price date and timescale of water privatisation which as my noble friend said the house has in principle approved <e> <s> the noble lord lord ezra wished to intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for those comments <e> <s> i do not think that they contradict anything that i have said <e> <s> i congratulated the noble lord on the persuasiveness with which he spoke on the wholesomeness of water <e> <s> i do not disagree with what he said <e> <s> i am addressing the amendment <e> <s> he addressed a general principle with which many might agree <e> <s> he then jumped a huge intellectual step and said the amendment will achieve those objectives <e> <s> i do not think so <e> <s> that is the point of our difference <e> <s> it is not with regard to the achievement of satisfactory water <e> <s> i certainly do not disagree with him on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with everything that the noble lords lord carter and lord allen said <e> <s> i was not aware until two minutes ago of the actual figures which were quoted by the minister <e> <s> i do not think i am that worried by the figures and the discrepancy between those quoted by him and those of the noble lord lord carter for this reason <e> <s> one of my anxieties about the amendment is the drafting <e> <s> perhaps i may refer to the third line <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may finish my point and then of course i shall give way to the noble lord with pleasure <e> <s> many people are virtually unable to walk <e> <s> it may be that it would be reasonable for people to argue then that this should be part and parcel of the definition of the allowance it should be defined more clearly so that we know what we are talking about <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i am aware of the last point he made <e> <s> however my point was that that itself has given rise to some difficulty even when dealing with much more clear-cut physical matters <e> <s> i suggested to him that he might consider changing the wording in this amendment or in a subsequent amendment simply for the sake of clarification <e> <s> clarification is quite important in reducing the distress of appeal <e> <s> that was the point of raising the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords at committee stage i made some remarks concerning a similar amendment moved by my noble friend <e> <s> i believe that i was mistaken both in the interpretation that i gave to the amendment at the time and in one or two of the remarks that i made <e> <s> i support what she has to say now <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will be kindly disposed towards this amendment with which i agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i am rather sorry that we are discussing amendment no <e> <s> without considering amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> to leave out the clause in a sense goes with the other amendment <e> <s> it means that we are exchanging the clauses <e> <s> i accept the fact that it makes acceptance extremely difficult <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to detain the house by intervening again in this debate but i think that the noble earl has slightly misquoted the point in the argument that i put forward <e> <s> when i referred to the taxpayer i was referring to the social security payments not claimed back <e> <s> i did not at that point deal with the question of contributory and non-contributory benefits in social security payments <e> <s> i was referring to the taxpayer in general <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to intervene on two grounds <e> <s> one is that i do not like this amendment <e> <s> i believe that on practical grounds if no other i accept entirely the theoretical grounds put forward by my noble friend many members of this house must at one time or another have been either a political candidate for the other place of have assisted in canvassing for friends who were standing in one interest or another for the other place <e> <s> noble lords must recognise how very difficult it is to avoid in anything that one says as a result of ones own political activity or in promoting that of ones colleagues or friends involving the local authority in the area in which one is active or indeed perhaps local authorities generally <e> <s> that is extremely difficult <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome this bill <e> <s> i must declare an interest because this is a field in which i exercise my professional activities <e> <s> i deprecate and deplore the circumstances that give rise to this bill <e> <s> i share the hope of the noble lord lord winstanley that the bill will help to prevent similar recurrences in the future <e> <s> i believe it is extremely unlikely that such things could happen in the national health service which is one of the questions that the noble lord lord ennals asked <e> <s> i shall not press my noble friend the minister today on the subject of the reports because disciplinary proceedings or inquiries are taking place and it would therefore be improper to inquire further into the nature of reports which if made public might prejudice those proceedings <e> <s> it will be a totally different matter if the proceedings are completed shortly as they probably will be then to request their publication <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad to hear that because i agree with the noble lord on that point <e> <s> i join the noble lord lord winstanley in welcoming the bill unreservedly <e> <s> i wish like him that i could say that on many other occasions as <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the noble lords problems as regards why donors do not end up donating their kidneys is this <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes to donate he must die in the right place at the right time in the right conditions of the right diseases in the right hands and in suitable circumstances <e> <s> that is the difficulty with regard to the wishes of the donor and donor cards <e> <s> forty million cards are carried <e> <s> one million people may die but only a few end up donating their kidneys <e> <s> it is the sheer complication of the situation <e> <s> it has nothing to do with the relatives permission or otherwise <e> <s> on that latter point he may think he stands alone <e> <s> but my view of a man is that he stands in relationship to his family and he should not forget that fact even in death <e>", "<cs> i hate to disappoint the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> i am one of those who in general does not like the idea of political assistants <e> <s> i accept that they have a part to play and i accept that since the late s or possibly early s they have <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should have said that it would have been predictable for the noble lord to try to change the numbers or make them flexible in the sense that a local authority should decide how many it wished to appoint <e>", "<cs> although i agree with the noble lords comments i should point out to him that it is the convention both in another place and in this chamber for members to declare interests which reflect in some way on the matter under discussion <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that the observance of this convention may have changed slightly but i believe that if the noble lord looks through the rule book he will find that that rule is applicable to this chamber also <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for those kind remarks <e> <s> i hope that his kindness continues for many months and even longer <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house i thank the noble lord <e> <s> i hope that in his case also the honeymoon period will be prolonged <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i am of course aware of the case mentioned by the noble lord lord kennet <e> <s> i should prefer not to comment upon it <e> <s> it happened before the bill <e> <s> i hope that i can satisfy him on two points about which he asked <e> <s> the first was about the authority that will be set up <e> <s> it will be the unrelated live transplants regulatory authority which will comprise of about a dozen people <e> <s> there will be a medical chairman and a majority of health care and medical pesonnel on it <e> <s> at the same time there will be lay members who will be able to provide the influence and opinion of lay people in an area which has considerable moral as well as medical overtones <e> <s> i hope that that will satisfy the noble lord on the point <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to thank the noble lord lord rea for the kind words that he uttered when he started his speech <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble lord lord ennals for his remarks which were a continuation of those that he made earlier this afternoon when i said in reply that i hoped the honeymoon would last longer than the recess <e> <s> my noble friend lord henley will wish me to associate him with these thanks to both noble lords and to thank them for the kind comments about his services as health spokesman in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be very nice to know that the standard of living was rising so fast that even though one increases the price of a product by per cent <e> <s> nonetheless one can afford it even more easily <e> <s> if we treble the price of something and increase peoples income by six times it will be very beneficial <e> <s> we then wander into a terrifically difficult area in which in one field the freedoms of individuals are significantly curtailed with regard to costs and prices <e> <s> and yet the same people would be very unhappy if their freedoms were curtailed in other directions <e> <s> one must bear in mind the balance of freedoms in this kind of matter <e>"]
