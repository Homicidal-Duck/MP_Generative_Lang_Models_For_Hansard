["<cs> my lords i hope that in addressing your lordships house for the first time i may have your indulgence and particularly if i should unwittingly transgress any established custom or tradition of the house <e> <s> all who have any connection with cathedrals must be grateful to the noble lord lord sudeley for introducing this report to the house and providing the opportunity for this debate <e> <s> i speak particularly from the experience acquired in five years as dean of worcester cathedral but in addition to that of course i now live only a few yards from chichester cathedral and last year concluded a formal visitation spread over a period of six months <e>", "<cs> my lords we must all be most grateful to the noble lord lord glenmara for providing the occasion for us to debate this important subject of the state of education in our country <e> <s> it is the concern of all of us and particularluy of those who have children still at school or university or who have responsibilities in higher education and i speak as one in all those categories having a child still at school and a child at university and a child who has just left university and is unemployed and being also chairman of the governors of an institute of higher education <e> <s> i speak also because the church of england has a long-standing concern and responsibility in the field of education through our own church schools and in many other ways but i wish to emphasise that we are not just concerned with re but with education in the broadest sense <e>", "<cs> my lords in that part of my speech in which i referred to the teacher/pupil ratio i was referring not specifically to west sussex it was later in my speech that i made such a reference <e> <s> however as this matter has been raised may i say that in the years which the noble lord has quoted my wife was teaching in one of those schools and she was attempting to teach french to a class of and i think that that was happening as regards other subjects <e>", "<cs> i regret that i was unable to be present at second reading but i have read the account of it very carefully and have read twice over both speeches of the noble lord the minister <e> <s> i have been trying to compare what he said with my own experience in relation to the two housing associations connected with my diocese and also in relation to the brighton housing trust of which i am a patron <e>", "<cs> my lords we now return to the debate on the motion of the noble viscount lord buckmaster <e> <s> i welcome what has been said on the motion by other speakers <e> <s> it is particularly helpful that we should have an opportunity to discuss this subject in an atmosphere which is not clouded by some recent riot or some recent serious racial trouble <e> <s> may i apologise for the fact that i have to leave the house for another engagement shortly after six oclock and that i may therefore be unable to stay for the end of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish briefly to give support to the motion from these benches <e> <s> i have been interested in how very often at the social gatherings which follow confirmations and similar occasions i am asked about the proceedings of this house <e> <s> people are very interested when i try to explain how we are a self-regulating body and the atmosphere of courtesy that prevails <e> <s> if further proceedings of this house could be televised i am sure that it would do a great deal to help the understanding of the house in the country at large and to remove prejudice and misunderstanding <e> <s> it is perhaps worth remembering that some proceedings of the house are already televised on the occasion of the state opening of parliament <e> <s> it would be an additional advantage for people to be able to see that we do something else besides this great ceremonial occasion that we are a working body <e>", "<cs> my lords i yield to no one in my respect and regard for the prayer book as one of our chief standards of doctrine and in my affection for its language as a vehicle of worship <e> <s> as required by the canons i read matins and evensong every day and i choose to do so from the book of common prayer usually with a lesson from the authorised version of the bible <e> <s> but it is the merits of a bill and not the merits of a book with which we are concerned this evening <e> <s> i will ask for your lordships patience if i begin with a brief survey of attempts to control public worship by parliamentary legislation since the middle of the last century when a combina-tion of social change and theological renewal began to make the pattern of worship which had prevailed in the two previous centuries increasingly unsatisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure we must all be grateful to the noble lord lord brimelow for this motion and for giving us the opportunity to debate this report <e> <s> the existence of the first lom convention was for many of us an important factor in commending the european community at the time of the referendum <e> <s> i am sure we are also grateful for the encouragement which has been given to the recommendations of the report by the noble baroness lady young <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add a few words from these benches <e> <s> the bishop of rochester was able to express some of our feelings last week when i myself was unable to be here <e> <s> brighton is in my diocese and i was privileged to be able to share in the service held yesterday morning and in the afternoon to visit in hospital the two members of the other house who have been mentioned <e> <s> i should like to add my tribute to their bravery and courage in facing not only their own physical condition but also the great anxieties which they naturally have about their families <e>", "<cs> my lords at this hour i shall try to be brief <e> <s> i should like to begin by recalling that the voluntary societies and organisations have a long history in our country <e> <s> back to the time when i was dean of worcester <e> <s> i was <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a privilege to follow the noble earl and to be the first to offer congratulations to him on his maiden speech <e> <s> the noble earl lord longford has anticipated this by an account of the contributions of the noble earls father in this house <e> <s> i can only say therefore that a great tradition is being maintained <e> <s> we are helped greatly at the beginning of this debate to have a speech giving us so much informed and sensitive advice from someone who is in a position really to know about the subject <e> <s> we hope to hear the noble earl on many further occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak in this debate with a considerable degree of reluctance partly because i have not been present at the debates on previous bills of this kind and also because it is not pleasant to have to discuss the personal affairs of individuals least of all of those whom one does not know <e> <s> i have tried to study this bill <e> <s> i know that the bill itself although it is a private bill concerning the marriage of two persons puts the whole matter in the realm of public policy <e> <s> paragraph of the preamble on page lines to of the bill says that the parties <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to speak in the debate but as i think the only member of these benches who has been responsible for running a cathedral i should like to say a word about the business of cathedral shops <e> <s> i was not able to be at the second reading of the bill but i have read the report of that debate and i noted the fun that the noble baroness lady trumpington was having with the bishops on that occasion <e> <s> i am tempted to reply in the same vein that bishops have next to no control over their own cathedrals <e>", "<cs> i should like to suggest that there is a difference and quite an important difference between the relationship of parent and child and the other relationship that has been mentioned <e> <s> many of the arguments advanced by the right reverend prelate the bishop of birmingham in connection with the previous amendment arguments concerned with the need to protect the family and to have rules to protect sexual relations within a family apply equally in this case <e> <s> at this late hour i do not propose to weary the committee by repeating them all over again <e> <s> the right of the individual to marry whom he or she chooses cannot be absolute <e> <s> it is already limited by consanguinity which has among its other purposes the promotion of the right relationships within the family and protecting them and helping to provide the right setting in which people grow up <e> <s> similar considerations apply to affinity <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i can answer that question without having time to think about it <e> <s> my immediate reaction is that there is some difference between the two <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the representatives of the church of england have repeatedly expressed themselves in favour of a fixed easter <e> <s> does he not agree that if there is to be a whitsun bank holiday it would be more logical to have it at whitsuntide than at some other period <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful as we all are to the noble lord lord blake for introducing this subject to us this afternoon <e> <s> i am particularly grateful for this debate as chairman of the group which prepared the cathedrals measure to which the noble lord referred and which is now before the general synod <e> <s> therefore i am grateful to have the opportunity of speaking to your lordships about that measure and about some other legislation which will follow it <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may intervene i did not say that the legislation was any of those things <e> <s> i said that those were words used by correspondents to me about the people who dealt with applications and about the way in which they were being responded to <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may associate my colleagues on these benches with the expressions of distress and sympathy <e> <s> the most reverend primate the archbishop of canterbury has already issued a statement asking all church people to remember in their prayers now and over christmas all those who are suffering as a result of this terrible disaster <e> <s> i am sure that we shall all respond to that plea and bear in mind not only those who are suffering but those who are involved in the exacting and harrowing rescue work <e>", "<cs> my lords it may seem a little the strange for a bishop of a see so far away from the area in question as chichester to intervene in the debate <e> <s> however the right reverend prelate the bishop of lincoln is not a member of your lordships house <e> <s> i am a lincolnshire man born <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may express my thanks to the two noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> this is the end of a long process over cathedrals and it is gratifying to find the measure so warmly welcomed <e>"]
