["<cs> my lords i am sure that this is completely out of order but i should like to add my voice to that of the noble lord lord walston in thanking the noble earl for his remarks about new zealand <e> <s> i can assure the noble earl that they will be very sympathetically received in the country to which he referred <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may resume this slightly staccato debate first may i thank the noble earl lord kimberley for introducing this subject which has already aroused considerable interest in your lordships house and which i would suggest is of increasing and very urgent importance <e> <s> it interests me too that yesterday we should have had a debate on drugs introduced by the noble earl lord denbigh <e> <s> after all alcohol is a drug <e> <s> however in the thoughts of most of the people who are concerned with these matters it is becoming separated from the hard drugs <e> <s> it is <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister consider in view of the public interest in this subject and the divergent opinions expressed that perhaps time might be made available for a proper debate and discussion instead of this question-and-answer business <e> <s> would he not agree that at the moment it seems that her majestys government are doing the right thing in the wrong way and most of the olympic bodies the wrong thing in the right way <e>", "<cs> my lords i personally wish to give this bill my wholehearted support <e> <s> i have listened with intense interest this afternoon to the many views put forward not only by the noble lords my medical colleagues but also by noble lords and if i may say so even more ladies whose lay knowledge of the health service has been unique and extremely stimulating <e> <s> in this connection i too should very much like to congratulate the noble baroness lady mcfarlane on the way she dealt so wisely and so simply with a most complicated subject <e> <s> we all know her vast experience but to be able to express the views she did so delightfully i think was a great treat for this house <e>", "<cs> my lords even as early as this in the debate i get a feeling of <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister be willing to consult the medical commission on accident prevention who have looked into this subject for the past years who are very knowledgeable about it who run a number of very successful courses in the southern counties and who voluntarily give a certificate to those who become trained up to the point which we are discussing <e>", "<cs> first i should like to resume the courtesies of your lordships chamber which we appreciate so much <e> <s> as co-sponsor of the amendment i wish most strongly and warmly to support the noble lord lord nugent of guildford <e> <s> whatever might be our views on the subject and i do not think that they are nearly as contentious as would seem from the debate so far we would all admire the noble lords pertinacity and perseverance in carrying on with this measure from year to year from session to session to him it must seem almost illimitable <e> <s> i feel that today he has at last brought us to a point of decision i sincerely hope so <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel as has already been said that one speaks with considerable trepidation after what one has already heard <e> <s> i hate to differ from the noble baroness lady macleod of borve but i feel that it is only right that we should look at the other side of the matter <e> <s> i am not an obstetrician and i never was but i have had a good deal to do with obstetricians over a long life both inside and outside the royal college of obstetricians <e> <s> i have no difficulty or doubt in saying that the consensus of their opinion would be what i was taught and what i have always believed ever since that pregnancy is a normal physiological process <e>", "<cs> my lords like my noble friend lord richardson i feel i must declare an interest in that i speak to you as an ex-junior hospital doctor very <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it is probably poetic justice that i should have the privilege of following the noble lord lord wells-pestell in this debate for it is the first time that this has occurred when we have been talking about medicine <e> <s> on every occasion we have differed very considerably which has not worried either of us because i believe that at heart we are aiming at the same end and we have become firm friends <e> <s> despite the fact that it would seem that the noble lord directs the busy little bee in his private practice bonnet directly at me every time he speaks about it i hold no whatever and i shall not reply in kind except very indirectly later in what i have to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the compliment <e> <s> i am sure that i voice the feeling of all noble lords when i say how much we owe to the noble lord lord hunter of newington for his very well-informed and very challenging speech which opened up this debate <e> <s> i was glad to hear it because when i read his motion on the order paper i felt a little sad that we should yet again be considering how we could improve the national health service and how we could make a critical appraisal of yet another reorganisation which incidentally is still not finished <e>", "<cs> i am glad the noble lord made that point my lords with which i entirely agree <e> <s> in fact i served in lcc hospitals for quite a while <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we must all be very grateful to the noble lord lord bellwin for giving us the original direction and stopping us discussing the original act and sticking to the business of this morning namely the regulations concerned with that act which is of course an enabling act <e> <s> i still have a vague feeling of nero fiddling while rome is burning <e> <s> i say that because it is more than a year since the seat belt bill was passed in this house <e> <s> there were a number of discussions prior to that as your lordships know well <e> <s> it will be at least another six months before the regulations can possibly come into force <e> <s> i cannot help thinking that in the interval since the seat belt act was passed there have probably been something up to deaths and thousands of <e>", "<cs> no my lords i certainly cannot agree because i believe that they will prevent a lot <e>", "<cs> my lords when first i saw the question put down by the noble lord lord kilmarnock i wondered whether he planned to discuss only generic drugs <e> <s> but when i examined the question more closely and saw its reference to the greenfield report it became quite obvious that the discussion this evening would be more general and would deal with the different methods by which money could be saved in the prescribing of drugs in the national health service in other words a comparison of other methods with the limited list a matter in which i personally am more interested <e>", "<cs> my lords until i came here this afternoon i was not aware of the batting order of speakers tonight <e> <s> it was only after i arrived that i learnt that i was to follow the noble lord the minister <e> <s> this your lordship may be surprised to hear i consider to be a privilege though it is equally a very difficult task because i disagree with a great deal of what he has said <e> <s> his speech was as ever gracious lucid and comprehensive but i sympathise with him for having had to make it so many times and in so many different forms over the last three months <e> <s> i could almost make it myself but not nearly as efficiently <e>", "<cs> my lords i am fully aware that in all courtesy i should make some definite reply to my noble friend lord monson particularly after that very detailed very well thought out and delightful speech that he has just made <e> <s> but if your lordships look at the list of speakers you will realise that i am in a very invidious position <e> <s> i am as it were like a simple nut between the two very strong jaws of a rather potent nutcracker because after i have said my few words i am to be followed by my noble friend lord balfour of inchrye who holds very similar views to those of the noble lord lord monson <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment <e> <s> as an ancient medico and way down the batting list i feel that it has an awful lot of good common sense and a message of health that we have not heard here for a long time <e> <s> most points have been brought out already but i should like to put two very minor points that i believe to be of importance because they refer to teaching children <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness withdraws her amendment if she does i should like to put a few points on this suggestion because i think it is really something quite new <e> <s> i am not sure that all that has been said so far really puts across what we are aiming at <e> <s> it seems to me that this is a completely new concept if we accept it <e> <s> the bill gives us a golden opportunity as a government rather than perhaps as local authorities to do something new something constructive and to improve the education system which i rather imagine most people here will feel has not had great success in the past few years <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord bottomley for fathering this motion and for his rather ingenious method of introducing what has really become a mini-debate on the nhs <e> <s> i do not imagine for one moment that in this debate it is necessary to express an interest but i should like to say that i have man and boy for the last years been involved with british medicine <e>", "<cs> my lords i am bound to say that i was absolutely shocked when i saw this amendment down today particularly to see that it had the support of such eminent noble lords and noble baronesses <e> <s> i must declare a direct interest as i am a director very much a non-executive director of a pharmaceutical company <e> <s> but if as there seems to be little doubt the proposers of this amendment are suggesting a specific exclusion of the pharmaceutical profession from the possibility of using a defence that anybody else can use the development risks defence then i suggest to your lordships that that is illogical unfair highly discriminating and very much against the benefit of the community <e> <s> those i realise are harsh words but i mean them <e> <s> i am not at all biased or on one side of the picture <e> <s> in fact because i have made this statement i should like to put some words on the other side of the picture <e>", "<cs> my lords with permission let me say that drugs are not protected except that there is a ceiling an upper limit for which compensation can be given <e>", "<cs> my lords thanks to the initiative of the noble and perhaps this afternoon slightly bellicose lord lord ennals we are again discussing the state of the national health service <e> <s> medically speaking i feel that that state is such as to give rise to acute anxiety <e> <s> the nhs seems to be suffering from an extensive number of serious diseases <e>", "<cs> my lords for what seemed to me two very good reasons i had not originally intended to take part in the debate <e> <s> first long before the date of the second reading was announced i had accepted an invitation to a very interesting medico-pharmaceutical occasion which i imagine is now pretty well over <e> <s> secondly and much more to the point my medical status is now at best that of a rip van winkle and at worst that of a methuselah <e> <s> further whatever i may say will probably be considered miles out of date <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe there are about members of your lordships house who are on the active list and over years of age <e> <s> it is hardly surprising that we do not see many of them with the notable exception of the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby <e> <s> i must say that i enjoy appreciate and envy the cogent diatribes of the noble lord <e> <s> however nothing in the world would make me try to emulate the noble lord <e> <s> i must say however that i am myself rapidly approaching the portals of that eminent club the nonagenarian club <e> <s> that is quite a mouthful <e> <s> i hope your lordships will therefore bear with me if i voice a few thoughts which go wider than the white paper and its consequent legislation on the nhs which has been so much to the fore in recent months and has been the sole subject of this debate so far <e>"]
