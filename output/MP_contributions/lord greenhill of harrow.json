speakers who have taken part in the debate and have come to share their views and very occasionally they have come to share mine <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord wolfenden i am a new member of the noble baronesss committee and i look forward to working under her chairmanship <e> <s> i enjoyed working with her in the foreign office a few years ago and i am sure this pleasure will

foreign secretary agree that one of the main objectives of the students is to prevent the emergence of an iranian government which could take a more or less normal and reasonable place in the society of nations <e> <s> it is not only the welfare of the hostages that we have to consider but the fact that the terrorists are trying deliberately to prevent the emergence of a government which could settle the problem in a reasonable and satisfactory way <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am sure you will agree that <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that we should thank the noble baroness for drawing attention to an important aspect of the subject that we are debating tonight and we should reflect carefully on what she said <e> <s> one finds that people are rather reluctant to speak about this aspect and are even more reluctant to do anything about it <e> <s> we should be very grateful to the noble baroness for drawing our attention to it <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not a subject on which i would normally consider myself in any way qualified to speak but the noble viscount lord sidmouth reminded me recently that together more than years ago we served an apprenticeship on the north-eastern railway and he seemed to think that that experience would entitle me to speak and to express some views <e> <s> my recollection of a brief railway career in the s is of an industry which despite the depression consisted of a dedicated and even enthusiastic work force who had a great sense of loyalty to their individual company and to the public <e> <s> they were not very commercially-minded and were more interested in playing trains than in making money <e> <s> i do not know how far those attitudes have persisted though i guess they have now been eroded <e>", "<cs> my lords it is late <e> <s> i shall be very brief and i hope that what i say you will not consider to be frivolous <e> <s> the message which comes to me from this characteristically lucid report is two-fold <e> <s> it is first that the fund is not achieving its objectives and secondly there is very little chance of significantly improving the position <e> <s> this i fear is the message which today all too frequently comes when the workings of the community are examined by subcommittees of this house <e> <s> shortcomings are identified but for political reasons it is virtually impossible to rectify them and this situation will surely become even more difficult after the enlargement of the community <e> <s> dissatisfaction with the present situation is not peculiar to this country to the british but is felt by many members of the community who share it with us <e> <s> even the germans have come recently to express some of their misgivings <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but is he drawing a clear distinction as perhaps he ought between what the community does through its community machinery and what it does as individual member states <e> <s> i think that the picture he is giving is rather misleading because he uses the term community sometimes referring to the machinery of the commission and so on and sometimes referring to the member states <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad <e>", "<cs> my lords members of the committee will draw great satisfaction from the debate which their report has stimulated today <e> <s> if it has ranged more widely than the subject of the report this is what we expected <e> <s> indeed this is what we desired <e> <s> on hehalf of the committee i should like to thank very much those members of the house who have found the time and the wish to intervene in this discussion and at times to speak kindly of the report and its conclusions <e> <s> the impression that i take away from this six hour long debate is that there is a very large measure of consensus within the house about this extremely important subject <e> <s> the fact that this consensus exists is a matter for encouragement and hope for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is appropriate at this time to congratulate the bbc television programmes on their coverage of the royal wedding yesterday <e> <s> it reminded us what an excellent and professional organisation the bbc is <e> <s> but it is no reflection on the bbc external services i think to say that probably the television programmes yesterday achieved in one day more than even the dedicated efforts of the external services could do in many months <e> <s> that bears out what lord campbell of alloway said in his maiden speech that vision is much more effective than radio in convincing people of what is going on and that the future lies more <e>", "<cs> my lords i am perfectly aware of that and i took it into consideration when i said what i did <e> <s> i still think i am right in the proposition i made which was that as far as attitudes to this country are concerned it achieved more in one programme than the external services could do over a period of time <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him to clarify one point <e> <s> if he is in favour of unifying the embassies of the eec would it not follow logically that the overseas broadcasting services of the eec countries should be unified <e> <s> is that what he is advocating <e> <s> or would each country have its own broadcasting service although only one embassy represented all the members of the community <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect i do not see that that follows at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i will be extremely brief and all the more so because not for the first time in my life i find myself so much in agreement with what has been said by the noble lord lord soames <e> <s> before i proceed may i say how much i welcome although in sad circumstances the transfer of the noble lord lord belstead to the foreign office where his talents are particularly suited to the work he will be called upon to do <e>", "<cs> my lords as the lord

agriculture one former minister of overseas development an internationally acclaimed expert on european affairs and the most successful and admired food retailer <e> <s> all these have added greatly to the authority of the report and i acknowledge now to the noble baroness lady white that the committee was wrong in hesitating to bring this subject for debate on the floor <e> <s> i think that the debate has been extremely useful <e> <s> thank you very much <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness a rather different question <e> <s> i have in the past been a member of the security commission but i do not think that the point which i am going to raise comes within the scope of the commission <e> <s> the point is this <e> <s> will the government please recall the cases of blake and the russian spies the krogers who were wrested from this country by the actions of the russians and thereby enabled to escape the consequences of their actions <e> <s> so long as the russians can recover from this country the spies that they have employed it will be an encouragement for further recruitment <e>", "<cs> my lords there are many speeches to follow in a subsequent debate and it would be unfeeling of me to speak for more than a moment or two <e> <s> but on behalf of the sub-committee i should like to thank the house for the kind things that were said about the report <e> <s> the committee will be very happy that it has prompted speeches revealing and reflecting great experience profound erudition compelling sincerity and even sometimes a little prejudice <e> <s> i should particularly like to thank the minister for his painstaking and characteristically clear answer to the debate <e> <s> i am sorry if he regretted my reference to the copenhagen timetable <e> <s> i do not complain about the timetable i doubt whether the train will run on time <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw <e>", "<cs> my lords i share with the majority of the house the great admiration that there is for this lucid and comprehensive report <e> <s> having served on lord franks staff in washington and having known him for over years it came as no surprise to me <e> <s> but i hope your lordships will not consider me flippant when i say that the whole episode of the committee and the report reminds me irresistibly of the late stanley holloways famous monologue albert and the lion <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not speak for more than three minutes <e> <s> i am quite sure that even the government themselves would admit that in the matter of the overseas students they handled the situation in a particularly insensitive way <e> <s> the old system was indeed unsatisfactory and was abused but the manner in which it was terminated caused damage to individuals to famous institutions such as the school of oriental and african studies and to british commercial and international interests <e>", "<cs> my lords i have hesitated to intervene in this debate because i am no longer in any way involved with wilton park and my close connection with the institution ended nearly years ago <e> <s> but i was attracted by the controversy in the press and i have done my best to ascertain the situation <e> <s> the conclusions to which i have come are not the same as those which have been expressed by the noble lords lord banks and lord beloff and lord beloff has the advantage of being a member of the advisory committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for being absent from the house during the speeches of some of its most authoritative members but i was trying unsuccessfully to reconcile my duties as a member of the select committee with the privilege of taking part in this debate <e> <s> i did however hear the maiden speech of the noble lord lord stoddart and i congratulate him on it <e> <s> so much has been said about the matter of grenada in parliament and in the media that it is difficult to separate fact from fantasy and fair judgment from prejudiced politicking <e>

down may i ask him about one point which he made <e> <s> he said that the source of authority in the commonwealth was the commonwealth secretariat <e> <s> i wonder which member of the commonwealth would agree with that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord said that the source of authority in the commonwealth was the commonwealth secretariat <e>", "<cs> my lords it was a great privilege to sit on the committee under the chairmanship of the noble viscount lord rochdale <e> <s> his long and authoritative connection with the shipping industry far from breeding prejudice

points prompted by the report first the role of the commission in this matter and secondly the chilling paragraphs to headed state of british shipping <e>", "<cs> my lords it is tempting to take advantage of the last word but i will resist it <e> <s> on behalf of the committee i would like to thank the noble lords who have complimented us on our report <e> <s> the report i hope will continue to be useful but tonight it prompted a debate of the kind which we had very much hoped for <e> <s> i should like particularly to thank the noble lord lord bruce of donington and the noble lord lord ezra for the excellent start which they gave to the debate <e> <s> i did not envy the minister the task of replying to such a long debate but he did so with his customary zest and fluency which sometimes strengthens his arguments and sometimes conceals their weakness <e>", "<cs> my lords i share with you the very great pleasure at being present at the introduction of the noble earl lord stockton this afternoon <e> <s> it is appropriate that he should enter the house on a day when we are discussing foreign affairs of which he was such a master <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his answer which i think is disappointing <e> <s> would he not agree that the republic of south africa should be a priority target for the bbc not only because of the differences with the south african government that we have and that the south african press have but also because in south africa

situation in the afghanistan area <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that we need to know more about this island <e> <s> the past is a good deal more familiar than the present <e> <s> does she not agree that small colonial territories like st helena for which we have full responsibility should have first call on our aid money <e> <s> the island is without natural resources and our <e>", "<cs> is the noble baroness aware that the requirements of the island are comparatively modest and that <e>", "<cs> speech all right <e> <s> is she aware that they are comparatively modest and in particular will she examine more closely whether the islanders should be given

know that it is very difficult for her to be precise about future expenditure <e> <s> would she not agree however that it is most important to give sufficient assurances of her majestys governments

my lords your lordships will not wish me to prolong the discussion tempting though it is to take up one or two points <e> <s> i think i can speak for the noble lord lord adrian when i say that both committees will be very satisfied with the debate which these reports have provoked <e> <s> there is clearly a wide area of agreement on which future policy can be built <e> <s> i should also like to thank all noble lords who have participated in the debate and sat until this very late hour <e> <s> we are very fortunate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord lord buxton has raised the question of st helena and in such an eloquent way <e> <s> it is inevitable that i shall repeat some of the things he has said though probably a good deal less effectively than he has said them <e> <s> i dare say there are many people who think there are more important matters for this house to discuss than this island but here i think is something where it lies within the power of her majestys government to make an overdue advance and to make it at no great material cost and without international argument and debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join other noble lords in paying tribute to the noble earl lord birkenhead <e> <s> he has to maintain a very high family reputation for speech-making and i think we would all agree that he did much this afternoon to uphold it <e>",

perforce repeat some of the points that have been made this evening although no doubt i shall do so far less eloquently than the speakers who have already had their time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his reply which is not unsatisfactory <e> <s> can <e>", "<cs> my lords in the debate on

noble viscount lord sidmouth is sitting next to me on the cross-benches this afternoon <e> <s> most people who have once been involved in the railway industry remain interested in it for the rest of their lives <e> <s> it exercises a strange attraction <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful for this debate and in particular for the persuasively argued speech of the noble lord lord home of the hirsel <e> <s> his speech was impressive all the more so because it was based on a lifetime of experience of soviet negotiations <e> <s> i hope that it will be noted by the soviet embassy in kensington palace gardens and drawn to the attention of mr gromyko who cannot doubt the bona fides of the noble lord and who has never concealed his personal respect for him <e>", "<cs> my lords i

i have seen that mr wigram was ever told by his seniors that those contacts were not to be continued <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very late and i shall speak very briefly <e> <s> however before doing so i should like to thank the noble lord lord mottistone for his initiative <e>", "<cs> my lords after the contributions of so many influential and experienced speakers it is difficult to make a constructive contribution to the debate at this stage in the afternoon but i should like briefly to try to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i greatly regret that i shall not be able to be present at the end of this debate <e> <s> i therefore apologise to the noble lord lord young for my absence and to the other members of the house who will take part in our discussions <e> <s> i am extremely glad to be able to hear the maiden speech of the noble viscount lord trenchard who brings very recent business experience to this house from the past years that he has spent in japan <e> <s> this will be a great asset to us all not least in todays discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords this is indeed an important and somewhat disquieting report <e> <s> it has already provoked an interesting debate <e> <s> before proceeding i pay a special tribute to the noble lord lord kearton whose remarkable physical and intellectual effort enabled us to cover a very wide field and to do so as the noble lord lord butterworth said in very agreeable meetings <e> <s> the noble lord has characteristically and effectively summarised the report <e> <s> i do not want to go over it all again <e> <s> but i should like quickly to make one or two points <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage of the debate there is bound to be a certain sameness about the speeches <e> <s> i apologise in advance should i repeat some of the points that have already been made even if i do so less eloquently <e>", "<cs> my lords from common departmental experience in whitehall i know the noble lord lord shepherd to be a modest man <e> <s> i do not wish to embarrass him by repeating the well deserved compliments of other speakers <e> <s> however i shall say how agreeable it was to serve on a committee under his chairmanship for which he was so well qualified <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with others in paying tribute to the presentation of the report by the noble lord lord kearton <e> <s> as a junior member of the committee i do not have a great deal to add to what he stated so well <e> <s> however i should like to speak very briefly on some points <e>", "<cs> my lords fears of unification privately or publicly expressed as the french among others have already found out produce a reaction in germany which is the reverse of what is hoped for <e> <s> my first point is that no one should be so foolish as to believe that a unified germany can be neutralised nor can it be anchored that is the word used by journalists to the community against its will <e> <s> but the movement towards unification is i believe we all agree irreversible <e> <s> the split of the country was never intended but as the noble baroness lady blackstone said the situation is rather like the entry of the british into the erm <e> <s> it is not a question of whether but when <e> <s> however the pace and form of unification have yet to be discerned <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the cross benches may i associate myself with those who have paid tribute to lord stewart <e> <s> as a former member of the foreign office i pay a special tribute to him <e> <s> when he came to the foreign office he was little known to anybody <e> <s> in a short time he earned affection and respect <e> <s> i travelled abroad with him many times <e> <s> i never heard the british case more cogently presented to our opposite numbers abroad <e>", "<cs> my lords i would like to apologise to the leader of the house and to the <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that we should all be better off if the general had not wilfully blocked our entry to the european community <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief <e> <s> i hope that what i have to say is not inconsistent with the report <e> <s> as a member of the committee that prepared it i agree entirely with its findings <e> <s> i do not believe that at any time in history have there been so many related international negotiations in progress and pending and so many governments seeking solutions to profound questions which will affect their futures in the next century <e> <s> the ec/efta negotiation is not the most important it is just one of several of those negotiations and the report clearly illustrates the difficult problems involved <e> <s> they have been repeated in the speeches today <e> <s> i wish that i felt more confident about the successful outcome of the negotiation within the timetable which has been set <e>", "<cs> my lords i was in two minds about whether to speak today until my former colleague the noble lord lord bridges who is at present in europe got in touch with me <e> <s> i decided then to speak <e> <s> much of what i shall say also reflects the noble lords views <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to join in the many tributes being paid throughout the country to the foreign secretary mr douglas hurd <e> <s> the majority of noble lords consider that he is serving the country very well with great energy and distinction <e>", "<cs> my lords we are also filled with admiration and sympathy for the hostages still held there and the patience of their families in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords all members of the committee are grateful to the noble lord lord aldington for his magisterial chairmanship of it and to the noble baroness lady serota for her calm oversight of all that we were doing <e> <s> as one of the least qualified members of the committee i shall speak simply and briefly <e> <s> most of the technical aspects of the problems have already been brilliantly discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for his informative summing up <e> <s> i thank also the many members of the house who have taken part in the debate <e> <s> its most useful result has been to establish the need for a further full-scale debate on the subject next year well in advance of the meeting in harare <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the motion <e>"]
