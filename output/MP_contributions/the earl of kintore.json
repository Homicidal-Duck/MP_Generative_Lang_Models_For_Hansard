["<cs> my lords i want to begin my few remarks by congratulating my noble friend lord armstrong on his very fine speech in particular because i come from further north and further east than he does and the points he made are most applicable in my part of the world <e> <s> otherwise by now most of the points that i was going to make have been made by other noble lords much better than i could have made them and i merely want in passing to underline just a few without going into them again <e> <s> as many noble lords have said it is an obvious and sensible thing to cut out waste and conserve materials which are in short supply and i very much agree with the noble viscount lord simon that we ought to be thinking <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to talk really about only one aspect of this problem the nuclear energy side of the question and in that regard the fast reactor and the safety angle <e> <s> i said a few words on this not very long ago <e> <s> i should like to say now that i think there are tons of uranium lying in stock <e> <s> the only way you can use that is in a fast reactor <e> <s> it is fertile and it is not fissile <e> <s> unless you put it into a fast reactor how are you going to use it <e>", "<cs> my lords i want first to thank the noble earl for giving us the opportunity of discussing the enormous subject of energy <e> <s> the only thing is that in a short debate you cannot really do more than talk about very few aspects <e> <s> i think i agree with almost everything he said in particular his remarks about a co-ordinating body <e> <s> this appears to me to be very lacking <e> <s> there are a number of obviously cost-effective opportunities for saving fuel and money <e> <s> are they being pursued with vigour <e> <s> it does not appear to me that sufficient vigour is being deployed <e>", "<cs> my lords the heat pumps that we had to utilise up north had to be obtained from germany <e> <s> i do not say that they are not obtainable here but one can get a better deal at least so it is deemed from germany <e> <s> that is a matter which requires to be looked into <e> <s> i am not saying that one cannot get a heat pump in this country of course one can <e> <s> however t hedevelopment of the heat pump is lacking <e>", "<cs> i certainly thought that a ratepayer had the right to see the accounts <e> <s> i had these accounts with my rate demand this year <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say what happened to the successful experiments of controlling grey squirrels by the use of warfarin baits <e>", "<cs> my lords when the minister replies can he tell me the position of oil companies and the storage of pipes machinery and so on which is often dumped ashore in various places <e> <s> there are times perhaps when changing ownership when they have a lot of equipment lying about which may be sold may not be sold may change ownership or something else of that sort <e> <s> not being a lawyer i find this clause difficult to understand <e> <s> if the minister would be kind enough to put me right on that i should be obliged <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to support the amendment but i want to be clear to renew my memory <e> <s> the valuation that is placed on shootings and fishing also i think is the average bag over the last five years <e> <s> if that is correct if you do not use shootings and i am thinking of the dog-and-stick farmers who are poor men and whose bag over the last five years will be nil then it is surely difficult for the assessors and i speak with feeling about this because i served on a valuation appeals committee for quite a long time if you put in a nil bag for the last five years because the average of nil is nil <e> <s> therefore i do not see what justification you have for rating a nil value <e>", "<cs> having gone through the local government reorganisation in scotland when the government succeeded in greatly accelerating the cost to local government satisfying nobody i hope that this time they will really look at all points of view <e> <s> for example our people who represent cosla do not <e>", "<cs> my lords we can be paid for the trip there and back once a week if one has only one car and no transport whatever otherwise than that <e> <s> that applies if one has to take the car and your wife has no car to use until you return <e> <s> that problem has been recognised <e> <s> and there is this provision once a week <e> <s> that would be fine if we could limit our trips to attend the house to only once a week <e> <s> but that is not the case <e> <s> i live a long way from an airport and the second time that one makes the trip one has to pay for it oneself <e> <s> i do not think that that is very logical nor awfully just <e>", "<cs> can my noble friend the minister answer one question <e> <s> does the amendment which he has accepted include the provision of tapes in common market languages so that visitors whom we try to attract would by pressing a button have an explanation of an exhibit in their own language <e>", "<cs> i want to make it clear that i agree that the power of making a charge must be left in this bill <e> <s> there is no reason why there should not be one or two free days during the week <e> <s> however those who do not want to have quite such a scrum and want to be able to see exhibits by paying should be able to reserve the opportunity and also add to the funds of the museum by so doing <e>", "<cs> the question of european water has been raised and i should like just to mention that from aberdeen we supply many thousand tonnes of water to russian trawlers and also to all kinds of shipping <e> <s> at the moment it is not fluoridated <e> <s> there is another point that i should like the noble baroness to take note of and that is that for instance in the grampian region there are something like different sources of water <e> <s> there is the question of the practicality of fluoridating a small water supply if you are told by a health authority that you have got to do it <e> <s> i hope this is only a local argument which will be decided by the regional council and the regional health board <e> <s> i hope it is not an overall direction which can just be walloped on to us because in some cases it is not impossible but it would be totally uneconomic to fluoridate a supply for say three crofts or something of that sort <e>", "<cs> my lords although i do not have my name down to speak i should like to ask my noble friend a question in general terms <e> <s> can he tell the house what is the modern equivalent of beating the spear into a ploughshare <e> <s> how does one beat a nuclear weapon into a ploughshare <e> <s> it appears to me that one method would be to convert those weapons into fuel rods for nuclear plants <e> <s> i should like to know what the governments thoughts are on this matter and whether they are making any proper provision <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this idea but i would point out that it sometimes takes five or six years to put in the services required for houses <e> <s> wild ideas about building houses here there and everywhere are very apt to come out but this pays no regard to the services and the cost of putting in those services which is a very great fraction of the total cost <e> <s> i think that this is an excellent idea but that services should very definitely be considered <e>", "<cs> certainly in the last years when i was in local government whenever the quinquennial revaluation took place it was known in local government circles as the quinquennial confidence trick <e>"]
