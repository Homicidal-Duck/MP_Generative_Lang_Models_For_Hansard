["<cs> i am not my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure what the etiquette of the house is about congratulating a noble lord on his maiden speech from the back-benches but certainly i should like to congratulate my noble friend lord leonard on his maiden speech from the back-benches <e> <s> i am sure that all your lordships appreciated the fact that on this occasion he had to do his own homework <e>", "<cs> my lords i referred to the figure for not for this year <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord for repeating the statement which is being made in another place by the secretary of state <e> <s> i felt that on the whole it was rather an ungracious statement bearing in mind the fact that thousands of postal workers worked very long hours over the weekend after a long week of work in order to clear the backlog of the mails <e> <s> the present situation as the noble lord has said is the cumulative effect of a number of factors coming together <e> <s> perhaps the most important of these was the closure of the birmingham sorting office during the past few weeks <e> <s> i understand that only today for the first time was this office opened fully <e> <s> this has meant that mail has had to be sorted in all kinds of inconvenient and unsuitable places in birmingham such as in drill halls <e> <s> this is important as that particular sorting office is the fifth largest office in the country <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will not forget and we should not forget that until the recent problems the post office had been achieving over per cent <e>

lord for explaining in detail the contents of these two orders <e> <s> i am sure that noble lords will be interested to read in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house will again be very grateful to the noble lord this time for explaining the draft regulations and for telling us about the new margins of solvency required at lloyds <e> <s> judging from the noble lords explanation the proposed solvency margins seem to be very reasonable indeed <e> <s> i feel that the fact that as from st august lloyds has to comply with these regulations can only help to underwrite the worldwide reputation of lloyds as an institution <e> <s> furthermore people who deal with lloyds will know that lloyds is having to comply with these new regulations and that will give them added faith in the institution <e> <s> i believe that particularly in view of reported large claims against lloyds in recent times this proposal will be beneficial to the institution <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all noble lords <e>", "<cs> from the point of time when the aircraft arrives on the stand <e> <s> my lords the consultative committee is in a sense run as an organisation which has had a certain connection with the greater london council and is representative of the authorities in the area and other user groups ordinary users such as the consumers association and so on <e> <s> it can be said to be an independent body in the sense that it does not represent the airlines as such <e> <s> they recommended in their report of that the home office be asked to consider increasing the number of immigration officers at heathrow particularly for terminal arrivals and to look further into alternative methods of organising queues to accommodate short-stay non-british passport holders and thus improve service to all <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely accept what the noble lord says but the debate that has been initiated by the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with the noble earl lord selkirk in thanking my noble friend lord northfield for raising despite the lateness of the hour a matter which is <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to say anything on this unstarred question but having listened to the noble earl lord grey introduce this question and to the noble lord lord de freyne suggesting that it might have tourist features i believe that it is almost implicit that i should rise and add some remarks to this short debate <e> <s> i shall read with very great interest in <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly do not wish to detain the house too long at this fairly late hour but it is ironic that on the day when the post office announces a profit of million we should be debating the noble lords unstarred question <e> <s> of that profit about million is derived from the postal services <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord lord lyell very much for that innovation of not introducing the acronym <e> <s> for many years i have waged a campaign against new-fangled words which none of us understand <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always suspicious of grandiose plans in the planning field <e> <s> having been involved in planning problems in london for more than years and having seen the developments which have taken place one becomes even more suspicious of grandiose plans <e> <s> in particular i can think of two of the major problems in london with which i have been associated the problem of the redevelopment of piccadilly circus and the problem of the redevelopment of covent garden <e> <s> both of those areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i sometimes feel that we expect perfection of some of our national institutions and that we enjoy attacking the post office british rail or british airways <e> <s> perhaps this is because we all have our own personal experiences of where things have gone wrong <e> <s> the noble earl lord kimberley certainly enjoyed himself this afternoon <e> <s> he raised the important question of whether british airways strategy was adequate for meeting the problems facing the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank the noble viscount for repeating the statement on the industrial democracy experiment which is being made in another place at the present time <e> <s> i can only regret the contents of this statement <e> <s> it is as i see it harmful to industrial relations as it puts the clock back and it is certainly ironic at a time when the country is seeking better worker participation that this experiment should be curtailed <e> <s> it is also ironic that only months ago sir william barlow was writing in the annual report of the post office <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord lord trefgarne for explaining these two orders <e> <s> may i assure the house that i will not take minutes in replying to his speech as i know that there is an important function later this afternoon <e> <s> it is certainly very convenient for us to take these two orders at once and i was grateful to the noble lord for his explanation <e> <s> indeed i found his explanation more satisfactory than the explanatory note attached to the two orders which leaves one slightly bemused as to exactly the purpose of the two orders other than to alter the rates of levy for the reasons which have now been made clear by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for explaining the provisions of this order <e> <s> i am sure that noble lords will be pleased to know that from st january it will become legal to purchase small quantities of milk in little individual packs <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his remarks <e> <s> my reading of the paper was that they were only legal at millilitres if made up before st january <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for explaining this draft order and i am sure people will be pleased to know that it will be possible from st january to buy a kilogram sack of french coal <e> <s> i have always felt it very odd and regrettable that a country such as ours which has had its industrial past built on coal should be conceiving a situation when we would be wanting to buy kilogram sacks of coal but to conform with eec regulations it is obviously right and necessary that this proposal should be agreed to <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for repeating the statement made by the secretary of state in another place this afternoon <e> <s> for almost years we have had indecision on the question of future airports policy by various governments <e> <s> i cannot but agree with the statement that the time is long overdue for a settlement of the airports question <e> <s> i only hope that the government will be able to stick to their decision and that their decision is the right one <e> <s> the statement says <e>", "<cs> may i press the noble lord on this point my lords <e> <s> my recollection was that there would have to be a public inquiry into the planning application by the british airports authority for their proposed development at stansted <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for explaining the regulations and also for placing in the library the background paper on the aviation security fund second amendment regulations to which he referred <e> <s> i am sure that those noble lords who have seen the paper will have found it very useful <e> <s> certainly on the face of it an increase of almost per cent <e> <s> in the amount of the levy is very inflationary and indeed the noble lord himself referred to it as a huge rise <e> <s> one can well understand the concern of the airlines at this increase and their feeling that they could do the job more cheaply <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble viscount lord trenchard for explaining the constructive parts of the bill <e> <s> if it were not for the fact that clause was included in the bill i could welcome it but clause abolishes the price commission without proposing that its powers responsibilities investigative techniques and ability to act quickly be transferred to any other body and the reserve powers under clause to which the noble viscount referred seem to be quite inadequate <e> <s> that is most regrettable particularly at a time of rising inflation <e> <s> when the second reading of the bill took place at the other end of this building the rate of inflation was per cent <e> <s> today it is edging up to per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord robbins is quite right in saying that there are areas which are not included <e> <s> i have indicated some of the areas which in my view have not been included in the bill <e> <s> i regret their omission and in fact i hope that when we come to the committee stage these areas will be included in the bill <e> <s> indeed the noble viscount opposite has given a specific example of where he proposes to come forward with amendments and i shall come forward with others <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it will undoubtedly depend what particular restrictive practices the noble lord is referring to but certainly i would wish to see all restrictive commercial practices brought under the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish at the outset to thank the noble lord lord trefgarne for giving the house the opportunity of debating at this early date the question of airports policy and for so comprehensively introducing the debate <e> <s> as he rightly says this is a question on which there are many strongly held individual points of view and i have no doubt that the government will be under considerable pressure from different sources to change their decision on this matter but i hope in this case that the flexible approach outlined by the noble lord will be one which the government will stick to <e>", "<cs> i want to add just one word <e> <s> i was very surprised to hear the remarks of the noble viscount opposite about inflation <e> <s> i think it is largely unproductive to quote figures because everybody quotes different figures on different bases <e> <s> but what is absolutely undoubted is that inflation has shown a substantial increase since the government came into office and a lot of that increase was deliberately induced by increasing the rate of vat from to per cent now it would not be so objectionable that this clause should be included in the bill if later on in the bill there were adequate powers to deal with prices <e> <s> however these powers are not there <e> <s> a number of amendments have been put up to deal with them but in the absence of any adequate substitute for a price commission we feel that this clause should not stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> may i thank the noble lord for his explanation and say at this point that i was pleased to see a number of the amendments which the government have put down subsequently to this clause <e> <s> in the circumstances i am happy to beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> we welcome the fact that the noble lord has tabled this particular amendment as we believe that it is a very useful one <e>", "<cs> unlike the noble lord opposite i thought it might be for the convenience of the committee if in welcoming his amendment no <e> <s> i referred to my amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> we welcome the fact that amendment no <e> <s> has been put down and indeed it meets a number of the points raised in my amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> our feeling was <e>", "<cs> this amendment deals with a preliminary investigation by the director general and the intention of the bill which seems right is that this should be a speedy investigation <e> <s> my feeling is that this amendment would have the effect of very much delaying and extending that initial investigation and therefore on the whole my view is that the government view is probably the right one on this amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his remarks <e> <s> it was not my intention to press the amendment to a division <e>", "<cs> the point i wished to make earlier was first to thank the noble lord lord trefgarne for saying he will look at this again without holding out any great hope that he will be able to come back with a favourable answer <e> <s> i would point out that the amendment moved by my noble friend lord jacques refers to unnecessary and unreasonable expense <e> <s> it does not refer to the fact that the reference was unnecessary or unreasonable <e> <s> what it states is that the reference should never have been made an absolute situation <e> <s> therefore i hope when the noble lord comes to look at this that he will be able to take that into account <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble viscount takes that attitude to this amendment for it seems to us that this is a very worthwhile amendment and i had hoped that in fact we would have a constructive response to it from the noble viscount <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his remarks <e> <s> i persist with my amendment but will not press it to a division <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his remark <e> <s> i shall not press the amendment to a division <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his remarks <e> <s> i understand that there are a number of legal problems involving the amendment particularly in regard to the retrospective nature of it <e> <s> in view of the undertaking <e>", "<cs> my lords nobody misunderstood the noble viscount <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to thank the noble lord lord sudeley for his initiative in allowing us to debate the english cathedrals report by the english tourist board this evening <e> <s> i am only sorry that this debate has come on at such a late hour i feel a duty is put on me not to be overlong in my remarks this evening <e> <s> the only quarrel i took with his introduction to the debate this evening was the remark which he made that the english tourist board cannot lobby for aid <e> <s> my knowledge of the working of the english tourist board is that they are continually in and out of the department of trade lobbying for additional aid <e> <s> i should also like at the beginning of my remarks to congratulate the right reverend prelate the bishop of chichester for his thoughtful maiden speech with which i found myself largely in agreement <e> <s> i very much hope that we shall be hearing from him again soon <e>", "<cs> my lords many bills have been brought <e>", "<cs> my lords i fail to follow the noble lords argument <e> <s> he complains of the enormous size of the nationalised industries and says that this is one of the reasons why they cannot react quickly to market trends <e> <s> yet the proposal here is that british aerospace will remain exactly the same <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord largely for repeating the remarks which he made during the committee stage of the bill <e> <s> i hope that his examination of ways and means under the landlord and tenant act to solve this particular problem will eventually meet with success <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am slightly surprised at the remarks of the noble viscount <e> <s> he is quite right that we have been over this ground before <e> <s> the fact is that the clause as now worded as he calls it an absolute reserve is such that it will never be used <e> <s> we would in fact like this clause to be worded in such a way that it is capable of being used <e> <s> while accepting the general principle of the government philosophy that competition is better than price control this amendment proposed by us would bring the clause within the field of a clause which could actually be used for the purposes for which it is proposed rather than of a clause which would never be used <e> <s> it seems to me that the clause as at present worded is in a sense a sop to the public it is a sop to your lordships but does not in fact come into the area of a clause which would be used <e> <s> our amendment is to bring this clause within the area of a clause which could be used by a secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord for this amendment and the subsequent amendments <e> <s> i am glad to know that the difficulties have been resolved and <e>", "<cs> my lords i am slightly confused by the noble lord because amendment no <e> <s> is in the name of the noble earl lord caithness and others and is not in his name <e>", "<cs> my lords these three amendments are <e>", "<cs> if i may interpose for a minute my proposal was why in fact the bill could not say that the assets should be transferred to british aerospace not that they should be transferred straight away <e>", "<cs> if i may support my noble friend lord wynne-jones the noble lord lord trefgarne said that he assumed that a purpose of this amendment was to ensure that british aerospace would continue to do all it now does <e> <s> he turned it round and said it was a restrictive amendment <e> <s> in fact we never got from him an assurance that british aerospace would continue to do all it now does <e>", "<cs> i shall not press this amendment to a <e>", "<cs> this underlines the whole problem of the bill <e> <s> we shall come to many amendments with which the government will agree in principle and say that they are a good idea but that they cannot write the particular points into the bill because they are matters for the articles of association <e> <s> that is the problem <e> <s> this is a very important national industry and it is one of our national industries which is being passed into private ownership <e> <s> there are a good many suggestions with which the government agree which we think should be adopted by the new public corporation when it comes into being <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is quite right in his supposition but of course the secretary of state will not be disposing of just one share <e>", "<cs> am not satisfied with the noble lords answer but it is not my intention to press this particular amendment to a division <e> <s> there are other amendments later which deal with the question of the size of the shareholding some of which i may feel inclined to press to a division <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw this particular amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not intend to press the amendments to a division <e> <s> the proposal was not that the company should be in a privileged position but that the normal sort of commercial relationship which might exist between a company and a major shareholder should appertain in this case <e> <s> however in view of what the noble lord said i beg leave to withdraw the amendments <e>", "<cs> the noble lord made a very odd remarknationalisation without compensation <e> <s> full and fair compensation has always been paid by any labour government since labour governments have been in existence <e>", "<cs> i think that he would be speaking from the rostrum not from the platform <e>", "<cs> i must apologise but mr clive jenkins is not a member of the national executive committee and he would have been speaking from the rostrum not from the platform <e>", "<cs> i am waiting for the noble lord lord trefgarne to spell out his attitude to this amendment before i reply <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i say that what i am seeking clarification of is the governments attitude to the amendment moved by the noble lord lord balfour of lnehrye <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord <e> <s> i was interested to know what the government thought about this particular amendment and no doubt the noble lord lord balfour of inchrye will withdraw it on the undertaking given by the noble lord lord cullen of ashbourne <e> <s> let me be quite frank with your lordships <e> <s> when i looked through the amendments to be moved today i thought i could well lend my support to this particular amendment and i did not actually see that in fact the debate on this particular amendment would revolve around the question of whether or not a labour government would pay full or fair compensation <e> <s> i think that from a worker-shareholders point of view the much greater problem facing him is whether in fact the shares in the company which he buys today by the normal operation of market forces will in fact be more valuable in five years time or less valuable and he will have to make that particular assessment for himself <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his explanation in this matter <e> <s> this is not an amendment which i intend to press to a division <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord trefgarne has said that this is an amendment of principle <e> <s> despite the various minor points he put about this amendment and some of the side effects that it might have i will seek to divide the committee on this amendment on the point of principle that the government should retain a per cent <e> <s> holding in the company <e> <s> i believe that it would be in the national interest that a holding of that size should be retained in the company <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his explanation but i wonder whether i could press him a little further <e> <s> in making his explanation he said that under the clause the secretary of state would havea short periodin which to dispose of his surplus holding <e> <s> i wonder whether he could state what he means bya short period <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his explanation <e> <s> i understand he is saying that bya short periodhe means that the secretary of state would have to dispose of the shares within a month of becoming <e>", "<cs> may i thank the noble lord lord cullen of ashbourne for his full explanation <e> <s> the noble lord lord morris has slightly misinterpreted the point of my amendment <e> <s> i certainly have no desire to help to draw up the memorandum and articles of association of british aerospace limited <e> <s> indeed it gave me comfort from the reply of the noble lord lord cullen of ashbourne to learn that in fact the articles of the public company are almost drawn up and that they will be available for noble lords to see in the library before we reach the report stage <e> <s> that is a small step forward <e> <s> i hinted at a number of remarks which were made by the noble lord lord cullen of ashbourne when i moved the amendment that the articles as tabled were placed in the library by the government at the end of last year <e>", "<cs> in his reply the noble lord indicated that a reason why he disliked this particular amendment was that it included the wordsand resident in the united kingdom although he said that it was certainly the view of the government that all the directors should be british citizens <e> <s> in view of that i might be well advised to table an amended amendment at report stage <e> <s> however i have noted what the noble lord has said that he feels that this is not something which should be written into the bill <e> <s> our strong view is that items like this should be written into the bill <e> <s> however in view of his particular remarks about the defectiveness of this amendment i beg leave to withdraw it at this stage <e>", "<cs> the reply which the noble lord has given is not unexpected and in view of the late hour i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his explanation and i shall read his detailed reply with interest in <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his reply and do not intend to press this particular amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i thank the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> which i shall study with interest in <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord for explaining this amendment to the house <e> <s> as he says it is a technical amendment and we have no objection to it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has reiterated in his initial speech from the dispatch box the undertakings which have previously been made elsewhere <e> <s> he has also told us why it was unnecessary to include these undertakings within the bill <e> <s> but he has not given us a full reason as to why we could not give statutory force to these particular undertakings <e> <s> i would have thought that the ingenuity of parliamentary counsel could have provided a means for giving a statutory force to these undertakings <e> <s> in view of the noble lords attitude i have no option but to force this particular amendment to a division <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry at that reply from the minister <e> <s> he is right that my amendment would introduce an element of doubt but i regard it as an element of flexibility <e> <s> i confess that i am disappointed at the reply of the noble lord and i would have hoped that at least he could give us a considered explanation of his interpretation of the clause as at present drafted <e> <s> i do not propose to press the amendment to a division i do not think it would be profitable to do so <e> <s> but i am concerned that if at a future time a sort of burmah oil situation arises and there is a

arising <e> <s> i am fortified in the support for my amendment which i have received from the noble lords lord lloyd of kilgerran and lord robbins <e> <s> as i said i do not intend to press the amendment to a division but in view of the doubts that have been expressed from all quarters of the house i hope that the noble lord will have another look at the question of whether the present wording is really the right wording <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord has read the recent report of airlines in america

this afternoon on the standard of service provided by the post office <e> <s> one always has a fear when we debate a subject such as this that the post office will be treated as a whipping boy and

my lords i am sure we all hope that it will not come about <e> <s> it will certainly depend on the rate of inflation more than anything else <e> <s> i should now like to come to the third aspect with which the noble lord lord campbell dealt and which i do not think he said very much about the question of bad areas <e> <s> here in particular we think about the position in central london where there has been continual criticism of the postal services <e> <s> but the criticism is not only of the postal services in london <e> <s> there have been criticisms of london transports services and of the

long unscheduled debate i rise with i fear a slightly longer speech than the two or three or four which have immediately preceded it <e> <s> i should like first of all to thank the noble earl lord

noble lords have dealt with detailed aspects of these controls this afternoon and i shall not reiterate them save to say i believe that the bill does nothing for the vitality of local government <e>

the outset to welcome the noble lord lord trefgarne back from his extended tour of south america <e> <s> we note how quickly he has been put back into harness in having to move the second reading of a major bill so soon after his return <e> <s> we have had a number of fascinating and erudite speeches this evening but i am afraid i must bring your lordships back to the hard reality of the major purpose of the bill which in part i is designed to make british airways <e>", "<cs> at this hour i intend to be very brief <e>", "<cs> i have a great deal of sympathy with lord ferrier in his amendment <e> <s> as other noble lords have said this would impose a statutory obligation on the fourth channel to report daily on parliament <e> <s> one of the problems with the present reporting of parliament is that the present services achieve only a superficial level of reporting and tend to centre on the highlights of particular contests which take place in parliament <e> <s> my fear is that if the amendment is accepted in the terms in which it is written it will in fact lead to repeats of the present form of reporting of parliament <e> <s> i do not think that it would entirely achieve the objectives which lord ferrier has set out in his amendment <e>", "<cs> i was thinking particularly of the programmes to which the noble lord was referring <e> <s> there is of course an additional reporting to that <e> <s> i was adding that i thought that if the amendment were accepted as it stood that we could in fact see a repeat of the present forms of reporting <e> <s> my feeling is that this is something we would want very much from the fourth channel that it should innovate and experiment with forms of reporting our proceedings <e> <s> but if one proposed to tie it down in the terms of the amendment one might not achieve the objective which the noble lord lord ferrier seeks and the noble baroness lady trumpington made a useful contribution showing why the fourth <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> he is quite right in saying that the addition of the words in my amendment would not give any more powers or authority to the fourth channel than are proposed at present <e> <s> the purpose of the amendment was to make certain that some specific structure was established but i entirely accept the noble lords remark that for the structure to be established it is not necessary to have the amendment <e> <s> the remarks that i have made and the remarks <e>", "<cs> may i thank the noble lord for his remarks and for his almost per cent <e> <s> assurance that in fact these rights will be in the articles of association of the company <e> <s> indeed the intention of the amendment was to put down a marker to make certain that that was so <e>

objectives with a slightly different amendment at report stage <e> <s> therefore i beg to withdraw the amendment as it stands <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may very briefly support what <e>", "<cs> my lords in response to the statement made by the noble lord i am glad that the government have at last acknowledged the reality of the present financial uncertainties affecting the profitable operation of all airlines <e> <s> i am surprised that they did not acknowledge this earlier <e>", "<cs> in his reply the noble lord said that he does not think there is a need for such elaborate arrangements as are detailed in the amendment but i hope he will agree that it is necessary for proper arrangements to be made to protect the situation of individual members of staff and if in fact district councils are recruiting additional staff there should be some preference or priority given to county planning staff who become redundant as a result of this legislation <e> <s> it may be that the details as proposed are not necessary but i should have thought it was necessary for some protection to be made for the county staff <e> <s> to pay redundancy compensation when it need not necessarily be paid if a transfer could be arranged seems to be not necessarily the most sensible arrangement <e>", "<cs> i will look at what the noble lord has said in his reply and possibly return to this at report stage <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in view of those remarks i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i would hope that perhaps the noble lord himself might come forward with the amendment at report stage as in the case of an earlier amendment that i was talking about where there were defects <e> <s> i think that would be useful <e>", "<cs> before i withdraw the amendment i hope that the noble lord can assure the committee that he will use such pressure as he possesses to see that this legislation is brought forward sooner rather than later <e>", "<cs> may i withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the amendment which has been tabled by the noble lord and which we are taking together with amendment no <e> <s> a limits as he has said the areas in which urban development corporations can be established <e> <s> this amendment was tabled on friday th october that is only a very few days ago <e> <s> one wonders why this specific amendment was tabled <e> <s> most of the authorities caught within the terms of this amendment are labour controlled <e> <s> one wonders whether this amendment has been tabled in these terms because of the political complexion of the vast majority of the authorities concerned <e> <s> conversely one notices that all the authorities in greater london except one which are excluded from this amendment are tory controlled <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i ask him whether he is saying that bristol southampton and nottingham are not great cities <e>", "<cs> irrespective of any views which may be obtained on the hybridity issue we find this amendment entirely unacceptable and we will press it to a division <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his remarks <e> <s> i entirely accept that consultations have been taking place but we feel very strongly that the fact that there should be consultations should be written into the bill <e> <s> therefore i shall press amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> the amendment tabled by the noble lord lord evans of claughton has been tailored to meet the particular situation in merseyside and while the principle of the amendment is something which we wholeheartedly support that there should be members of the local authorities appointed to the urban development corporation the particular figures included in the amendment while they might be applicable to an area such as liverpool would find great difficulty in being accepted in areas such as the dockland boroughs <e>", "<cs> i have noted the remarks of the noble lord <e> <s> it is not my intention to press this particular amendment to a division <e> <s> i understand the point which he makes that this could cause grave problems to a particular plan of the udc but on the other hand i feel also that it is necessary to protect the aspirations of the local authorities in particular areas and i will look at his remarks and see whether there might be some more appropriate amendment which could be submitted at report stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not press this amendment to a division <e> <s> i feel that the powers are stronger than are necessary <e> <s> i also feel that the analogy drawn by the minister which he rightly says goes throughout these various powers from the new towns act is not a true analogy <e> <s> a new town is an entity established very largely on a green field site <e> <s> it is not an entity in a decaying urban area as is the intention here <e> <s> a great many principles and ideas do not apply <e> <s> this particular clause is a good example of that <e> <s> although i do not agree i do not intend to press this amendment <e>", "<cs> all i wish to say is that i support what the noble lord lord gainford has said <e> <s> i was glad to hear the reply from the government and i am sure that we shall look forward to the amended clause to be tabled on report <e>", "<cs> this amendment no <e> <s> as the noble lord has said and i am not sure whether he was speaking to this amendment or to another amendment had been for a long period in gestation <e> <s> this amendment was tabled by the noble lord lord bellwin on th september <e> <s> it first saw the light of day as far as other noble lords were concerned on th september <e> <s> this was one week before the committee stage of the bill started <e> <s> that was a comparatively early tabling of amendments compared with some of the other amendments which we are being asked to consider this evening <e> <s> many of the amendments before us this evening were tabled by the government after the committee stage of the bill had started <e> <s> looking through todays marshalled list which is the fifth marshalled list we have had <e>", "<cs> we have been discussing a number of clauses in the last half hour or so dealing with different powers which are to be given to the urban development corporations <e> <s> i rose on a previous clause which was giving planning powers to an urban development corporation and questioned the wisdom of that particular clause <e> <s> i must confess that i can see the logic in giving the planning control powers to an urban development corporation to enable it effectively to carry out its operations and indeed i said that if these powers had been given by agreement we would not be objecting <e> <s> but i think that an entirely different case applies to the question of housing powers <e> <s> housing is something which tends to be of far greater local concern <e> <s> it is a matter about which people are particularly concerned that in fact adequate housing policies are carried out in the area in which they live <e> <s> there seems to be very little logic in the proposal that these powers should be allocated to an urban development corporation <e> <s> i do not see that this can be regarded as a wrecking amendment <e> <s> it would be quite possible for the existing local authorities in agreement with the urban development corporation to carry out such housing schemes as may be necessary within a particular area <e>", "<cs> the noble lord said that this is a technical amendment <e> <s> it is the kind of amendment on which we would appreciate a note bearing in mind that in its present form it has appeared on the marshalled list for the first time only today <e>", "<cs> i found a slight difficulty in hearing the noble lord lord gainford in moving this amendment and i fear that a number of noble lords on this side of the committee did too but i should like to support the noble lord in this particular amendment which he has moved after clause <e> <s> there is a real problem here <e> <s> there is the joint docklands development committee and all the jobs on that committee will become redundant a chief executive has been appointed for the new urban development corporation from outside the ddo and senior members of the staff of the joint docklands development <e>", "<cs> i think that what the noble lord lord strathcona is saying is that this clause as it stands creates the power and the ability in the government to create an urban development corporation but does not in the bill set up an urban development corporation for docklands and therefore there is no need to set up the machinery to meet the particular need set out in this amendment <e> <s> but of course as my noble friend lord pitt says we all know and the noble lord lord bellwin has repeated this this evening the intention <e>", "<cs> i do not intend to press this amendment to a division at this time of night <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall study the noble lords reply with interest <e> <s> the particular point of his reply is that the powers are there and in fact the home secretary can demand any additional details or the authority can demand any additional details which are felt to be necessary <e> <s> my view of that would be that these are details which should be made available publicly <e> <s> i hope the noble lord is right that there is a sufficiency of detail which will become available <e> <s> my feeling is that the details which have so far been made available are not sufficient <e> <s> having considered the terms of his reply i shall probably come back to this at report stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble lord for his response to this amendment which i shall read with great interest in <e>", "<cs> i hope that the government have got it right <e> <s> ten years seems an appropriate period of time for a local radio station in say truro or one of the less populated areas of the country <e> <s> it might be too long a period for some of the urban areas <e> <s> on the whole my view is that years is the right period for a radio station which is on its first contract but that if one had a situation where a station was a reapplicant there would be a case for a shorter contract <e> <s> the problem here of course as we know is that the initial costs of setting up a station are considerable and it should be a sufficient period of time to enable a station with all the different circumstances which may take place in different areas to know that it has a period of tenure in which it can recoup those initial costs and move into a profitable state <e> <s> that will be a shorter or a <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord lord drum-albyn might still say that we ought to take amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> it is not my intention to press the amendment <e> <s> i will read the noble lords answer in the <e>", "<cs> in that case i am happy to beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> in that event i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> technically i do not move it <e>", "<cs> i still strongly believe that it is right that this power should be conferred on democratically-elected bodies <e> <s> i have heard what the noble lord lord bellwin has said <e> <s> in view of the fact that we are on the seventh or eighth day of the committee stage of this bill i do not intend to press the amendment to a division <e>", "<cs> i am pleased to hear that <e> <s> my antennae had not informed me of that as they sometimes do when the government are going to accept an amendment <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> enterprise zones will offer major inducements to developers particularly through the rating exemption <e> <s> if these inducements stimulate the development of industrial or commercial enterprises then unless they have moved directly from one area to another that will be a positive gain and will not undermine similar developments if they exist outside the enterprise zone <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord bellwin for his full and earlier reply and i am very glad that he accepts that there is a problem here and that he is exploring the ways how it can best be dealt with <e> <s> in the circumstances i withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> i am sorry he maintains the position which he displayed earlier in our considerations during this committee stage that it is <e>", "<cs> i have put down an amendment to leave out clause for the purposes of securing a general debate on part i of this bill <e> <s> when we were discussing over the past seven days the local government planning and land no <e> <s> bill for the better order of business we found it of considerable advantage to discuss the general principles of a section of the bill before proceeding with detailed amendments <e> <s> i have done this particularly today because we are now in a rather different situation on the first part of the bill from what we thought when we were debating it at second reading at the tail end of this summer <e> <s> it then appeared to the government that they needed this legislation in the current session of parliament to enable them to proceed with the business of selling british airways <e> <s> that is no longer so <e> <s> in the second reading debate it was made clear that the government were retaining flexibility as to when they would market the shares in british airways and it was also clear that one of the major issues was that that flotation should be successful <e> <s> that flexibility has been extended as the government announced on monday that they would no longer be in a position to market the shares in <e> <s> the earliest date that they can be marketed is in <e> <s> for those purposes the government would not need to have this legislation on the statute book in the current session of parliament <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend lord beswick has indicated we accept the necessity for this amendment <e> <s> all i wish to say at this stage is that i hope the government will have as relaxed an attitude to borrowing limits for the british airports authority when we come to later amendments in the committee stage this afternoon <e>", "<cs> having considered the response by the noble lord lord trefgarne i think that my right course of action would be to return to this amendment at the report stage <e> <s> we feel very strongly that the government should exercise their responsibilities as the major shareholder <e> <s> however as the amendment is perhaps not framed in such a way as would achieve the objectives that we have in mind i think that the best course of action would be not <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> as the noble lord lord trefgarne has said amendment no <e> <s> covers very much the same point <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> would write into the bill the necessity for the secretary of state to retain per cent <e> <s> of the issued shares at all times <e> <s> we know that this is the governments general policy at the present time <e> <s> we have had statements from the minister saying that we still have sufficient confidence to maintain our per cent <e> <s> shareholding <e>", "<cs> the problem with the articles of association with any company is that they can always be altered <e> <s> i know the government have tried hard to ensure that these particular articles of association which are not before your lordships today are foolproof in that respect <e> <s> however our view is that it would be a more satisfactory situation on that point and on the other points which have been mentioned in the debate if there should be written into the bill a majority shareholding or a per cent <e> <s> shareholding and therefore i wish to press the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has raised a point of difficulty but my view is that any decision for a flotation should be based on economic advice not political advice <e>", "<cs> the best economic advice <e>", "<cs> in view of the remarks made by the noble lord and particularly in view of his final assurance i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> that is right <e> <s> it was at the end of the session at about the latest time it could be made in parliament before the conservative party conference of that year <e> <s> but there is an opportunity here for the <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his response to this amendment <e> <s> i shall study his reply and decide whether or not i shall come back to it on report stage <e>", "<cs> i must say that i find the noble lords reply slightly tortuous <e> <s> he agreed that if as i suggested in moving the amendment the three airports were charged separately there would be a reduction in costs at heathrow and an increase at stansted and gatwick <e> <s> he said this was part of the overall campaign to get airlines to move from heathrow to gatwick and stansted <e> <s> the thing that has concerned me for a considerable time is the fact that various charges at heathrow are such that we have a continuing situation where there is a danger of airlines not moving from heathrow to gatwick and stansted but moving from heathrow to amsterdam or to some suitable european airport <e> <s> i think the government must accept that if they are to change the user patterns at heathrow this should not be done through higher charges as the noble lord was suggesting here but by getting the agreement of the airlines to switch to gatwick <e> <s> otherwise one runs into the other danger that airlines will move away <e> <s> basically his argument was that as the control systems in the whole of the london area were so intertwined it was impossible to separate them out although in the previous sentence he had agreed that in some way one could in fact separate out the charges <e> <s> i do not intend to press this amendment this evening <e> <s> i will look at his reply and possibly come back to the amendment at report stage <e>", "<cs> we are still on the question of air navigation charges and i want to raise the matter of eurocontrol <e> <s> the eurocontrol system far from providing a co-ordinated traffic control system in europe simply acts as a billing agency or clearing-house between the airlines and national aviation authorities like the civil aviation authority <e> <s> the present system allows a two-year time lag between the year on which costs are based and that in which they are collected it is an historical costs system <e> <s> this was devised during a period of monetary stability low inflation rates and a steady increase in traffic and assumed that any increase in costs between the cost reference and the collection year would be offset by traffic growth <e> <s> this system has come under increasing strain principally due to the slackening in traffic growth rates and to the wild fluctuations between the european currencies and the dollar in which eurocontrol deals <e> <s> the united kingdom in particular has suffered from the latter and has not been recovering the full cost of the civil aviation authoritys services <e> <s> because of this it has recently been proposed to implement a new system from st april and there is considerable concern about the effects of this new system and the way in which it calculates costs <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his response <e> <s> i am glad to know that his friendly secretary of state has received the report and broadly accepted the recommendations of the report <e> <s> i will read his reply very carefully and in the light of that i will decide whether or not to return to this issue at report stage <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am aware that there is a legal case in progress <e> <s> as i understand it one writ has been issued and another are on the way and i hope that i shall not impinge too much on that <e> <s> i think this situation has come about as a direct result of government policy <e> <s> it is entirely at the governments door and any consequences of this dispute for the travelling public and for tourists will arise from that <e>", "<cs> that probably would be the best course to follow though the noble lords remarks about the lateness of the hour make those of us who are involved with the local government bill smile because this is the earliest hour we have had for some nights <e> <s> i feel very strongly that this is something we must discuss because it is a facet of the bill which does have very serious implications it has particularly serious implications in my view for the virility of the tourist trade and it is not something to be swept under the carpet <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i thank the minister for his very encouraging response to the debate <e> <s> on the whole i still feel that the establishment of a training board would be the most effective way of ensuring that adequate and effective training takes place <e> <s> for my part i shall read his reply with great interest and decide whether i wish to proceed with my amendment further at report stage <e> <s> if however the noble baroness should decide to press on with her amendment this afternoon i would certainly support her <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord for making that statement which records decisions taken by the secretary of state on four appeals by airlines against decisions of the civil aviation authority <e> <s> one of those appeals was allowed with the consent of the civil aviation authority one was allowed against the judgment of the civil aviation authority and in the other two cases the secretary of state agreed with the decisions of the civil aviation authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> i felt that it was rather unsatisfactory but i shall study it with interest <e> <s> there was a particular area of concern which the noble lord did not recognise in his reply <e> <s> he said that the fund only had the duty to pay out expenses which had been properly incurred <e> <s> as the noble lord knows and as all noble lords know when one is trying to apportion costs there are very often many different ways in which particular costs can be apportioned <e> <s> if the airlines had more information made available to them as to how these amounts were arrived at i think that an element of the dissatisfaction could be cured <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his very full reply to the moving of this amendment <e> <s> i will need to study his reply in detail but for the present i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords surely amendments nos <e> <s> a and b have been moved by my noble friend lord mishcon

point though is which authority will make the application <e> <s> will it be the urban development corporation or will it be tower hamlets <e> <s> i should be very happy if the noble lord could say that the urban development corporation indeed some of the amendments which we discussed earlier today would have that effect would consult with the local authority if they had decided to make an <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly withdraw the amendment at this stage <e> <s> i have specifically in mind that when an urban development corporation is designated it should be written into the designation that they should consult if it is proposed that an enterprise zone should be established <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am glad that the noble lord is seized of the problem indeed he told us so during the committee stage <e> <s> one wonders whether the answer to the problem is that the local authority with such powers as it has over the enterprise zone would be very much concerned with what effects this could have and perhaps something could be written into the proposals in that way <e> <s> however if the noble lord has any further ideas perhaps we can come back to them on third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his reply which unfortunately i do not find very satisfactory <e> <s> he does not appear to be seized of the particular problem that local government officers feel that they are being less fairly treated than were their predecessors when similar enactments affecting their job prospects were enacted <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> i have been encouraged by the support which i have received from this side of the house and although it had not been my original intention to press this amendment to a division i now intend to so do <e>", "<cs> my lords the civil aviation industry is going through a difficult time <e> <s> during the passage of the bill i have wondered how relevant this bill is to the problems of the industry <e> <s> as a result of the passage of this bill british airways have been faced with a new uncertainty in that they do not know whether they are within or without the public domain <e> <s> they know that that uncertainty is going to continue for a considerable period of time because as the government have stated there will be no flotation of british airways in indeed it may not be until or beyond that a flotation is finally made <e> <s> although the government have indicated that they intend to retain a per cent <e> <s> shareholding in british airways after the initial directors have been appointed they are not going to appoint any directors themselves although in contrast to that when we discussed the new british aerospace corporation we learned that there are to be two government-appointed directors on the board of british aerospace <e>", "<cs> my lords the point on which i was seeking assurance was that the word grants in this paragraph includes retained secondary rental <e> <s> from his reply the noble lord was clear that retained secondary rental will be regarded by the iba as a grant and i am glad to have that assurance <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> i think there is still some

house on either of these two amendments at this time of night but i warn the noble lord that i may return to the second of the two amendments at third reading <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for tabling these consequential amendments to the amendments that i moved on report <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry the noble lord is not in a position to give those undertakings <e> <s> as i have said in earlier debates we have had on this issue the establishment of these major retail users within enterprise zones can have a very serious

not been able to give the undertakings which i have asked for this evening and i shall divide the house <e>", "<cs> my lords at third reading stage it is difficult to withdraw an amendment to reword a particular part of the amendment to take account of a specific word which the noble lord mentioned in his reply <e> <s> i refer to whether the word powers or duties should appear in line of the amendment <e> <s> therefore while accepting that the amendment might be defectively worded it is not in a sense open to me not to seek the opinion of the house as a whole at this stage because of some

i should perhaps say that the noble lord lord mccarthy was to have been present to do so but he is unable to be with us <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the house would like to thank the noble lord lord glenkinglas for introducing this debate this afternoon so enabling your lordships to have a comprehensive discussion on the aviation industry <e> <s> over the past year or two we have had a number of debates on different aspects of the industry but the motion before us today enables us to look at the aviation industry as a whole <e> <s> as the noble lord said in his final remarks your lordships house has in particular excelled itself in acting as a watchdog for the consumer interest travellers interest and that work has been spearheaded by the noble baronesses lady burton of coventry and lady trumpington on many occasions in this chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord tell us exactly what the matter is which is <e>", "<cs> my lords we all appreciate very much this standing order of the house and we all want fully to comply with it <e> <s> i attempted i believe to comply with it fully in the speech which i made <e> <s> however it seems to me that the matter before the court is primarily the right of the british airports authority to increase its charges <e> <s> that is the issue in dispute <e> <s> i should have thought a comment on the level of charges was quite different from the matter which is to be taken before the court <e> <s> neither i nor the noble lord are lawyers so it may be that we should seek advice elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords in supporting the noble lord lord sandys the point of the <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord inform the house whether any accompanying reduction in services is being monitored as a result of the cuts <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to thank the noble lord lord trefgarne <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> he referred to the fees for the registration of business names as currently being and but my proposal was that they should be increased to those figures <e> <s> the present fees which are quite inadequate are and i think p for a search <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether by the time we reach the committee stage the noble lord will be able to say what level of fees would cover the cost <e>", "<cs> other noble lords have underlined their reservations about clause and the noble lord lord rochester has made certain proposals for improving it <e> <s> the noble lord lord hinton of bankside has said as i was going to say that clause is a miscellaneous clause at the end of a miscellaneous bill and that engineers rightly feel that this is a very odd way to be treated it demeans their profession <e> <s> as the noble lord lord howie has referred to the letter from the presidents of the engineering institutions i would only add that the letter did underline to the secretary of state their dissatisfaction with this clause and with these proposals as they stood <e> <s> to be successful an engineering council needs to be supported by the employers the professions and the trade unions but it seems unlikely to happen with the proposal in the bill at the present time as clearly it does not have the support of the profession <e>", "<cs> the noble lord should do so now <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for repeating that statement which does not cause us any surprise <e> <s> i was glad to hear the statement indicate that the government wish to retain control of cable and wireless and will market something <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not wish to go over all the arguments which we had at committee stage on this particular clause but i think it is fairly obvious to your lordships that there is considerable concern about clause as it now stands <e> <s> it seems to me that the noble lord lord hinton of bankside has made out a very powerful case for an amendment to this clause in the particular form which he has indicated <e> <s> it may be that some other form of amendment to this particular subsection is possible for example indicating whether all or only some of the members of the council for the time being need be appointed by the secretary of state <e> <s> but in view of all the arguments which we have had about this particular clause i hope that the noble earl will either be able to convince the house that the clause is correctly drafted as it stands at the present time or will be able to look at this particular point again <e> <s> i shall certainly listen with great interest to what the noble earl has to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for explaining this draft order and i am sure all your lordships will agree that the same maximum limit should apply to domestic carriage as to international carriage and certainly that that applying to domestic carriage should not be less than that applying to international carriage <e> <s> i note that the new limit is to be sdrs special drawing rights <e> <s> i must confess that this term of a special drawing right is a new form of currency to me <e> <s> prior to this evening i was not aware of this particular new currency unit <e> <s> one wonders why this liability limit could not be expressed in some more common currency such as an ecu or an emu two units of currency of which we have some knowledge as opposed to this particular unit the sdr which i feel that few of your lordships will know about at all <e> <s> further one wonders why it is necessary for there to be an upper limit at all <e> <s> one would think that the possibility of individual passengers wishing to claim more or the relatives of individual passengers wishing to claim more <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord very much for his very full reply to my comments <e> <s> i was particularly interested to know what <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord has amended the instruction on the order paper as i was concerned that we might have to consider clause twice <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran in moving this amendment <e> <s> it is a paving amendment for the deletion of clauses and and the substitution of clause by amendment no <e> <s> and also for amendment no <e> <s> which deletes the reference to the repeal of the business names act <e> <s> the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran has given a lawyers point of view of the effect of the abolition of the registry <e> <s> i think it can be said clearly that if the registrar is abolished there will be no central register of unincorporated businesses <e> <s> this means there will be no access to information about a business other than from the business itself <e> <s> the point has been made already that there is no reason why the registry should not become self-financing and there have been many indications from businesses themselves that there would be no objection to a considerable increase in the size of the registration fee and a considerable increase <e>", "<cs> may i pick up a point raised by the noble lord <e> <s> on the basis of staff it would appear that the average staff costs would be approximately under <e> <s> in there were new registrations <e> <s> on that basis a fee of p would cover the staff costs and that is not taking into account any additional income from inspection charges which could raise a considerable additional amount <e>", "<cs> i do not feel so strongly about this amendment that i wish to press it <e> <s> i take the noble lords explanation which i shall read with interest and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this motion to leave out clause is consequential upon the decision of the committee earlier today and i understand that the government accept the consequences of the vote we took then <e> <s> therefore i beg to move that clause be left out <e> <s> for the convenience of the committee and i am not quite certain what the correct procedure is i would also although it is out of numerical order beg to move amendment no <e> <s> which is to leave out clause and insert the words as printed <e> <s> this is also consequential <e> <s> it seems to me that otherwise we should be dealing with a number of amendments to clause which as a consequence of the earlier vote would not now be in the bill <e> <s> i understand that <e>", "<cs> i think the correct procedure would be for me not to move all of the amendments standing in my name between no <e> <s> and no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble and learned lord for his reply which i will study in detail <e> <s> the intention of the amendment was to clarify the situation and i will see whether in fact his remarks meet that situation <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i thank the noble and learned lord for explaining the purposes of amendments nos <e> <s> to <e> <s> he rightly anticipated the views of the committee in moving the amendments in saying that the committee would have been much happier if these amendments had been included in the bill when published <e> <s> as it is tonight we are virtually engaged in a second reading debate on these clauses because they are very substantial in their effect <e> <s> we have no particular objection to the purpose of these clauses but shall want to examine each of them carefully and possibly come back with amendments of detail at report stage <e>", "<cs> as has been said by previous speakers this is an unsatisfactory situation which has characterised the whole progress of this bill through this house <e> <s> as my noble friend lord wedderburn said we had a whole series of amendments tabled just before the start of the committee stage and certainly we are far from satisfied with the position as it exists today <e> <s> in making this statement the noble lord lord trefgarne no doubt hoped that he would be saving a considerable amount of your lordships time but in view of the woolliness of his statement t think your lordships will want to debate in detail today some of the amendments which have been tabled on this subject <e> <s> indeed i believe that the view of the committee on these various amendments could help to crystalise the governments views before they table their own amendments <e>", "<cs> i am sure it is for the convenience of the committee to speak to these three amendments at the same time <e> <s> they cover the same point as my amendment no <e> <s> and we certainly agree to amendments nos <e> <s> and being made <e>", "<cs> it does not surprise me to hear from the noble lord that it is the intention of the government to return to this matter on report stage <e> <s> i hope however in view of the wide support for the principle of this series of amendments that the government will seriously think how best to tackle this problem <e> <s> the government will no doubt be very much aware of the wide range of organisations which have reacted adversely to the governments proposals to abolish the registry <e> <s> in returning to this again at report stage i hope that the government will take this very much to heart <e>", "<cs> i entirely accept the last point that the noble lord lord trefgarne made that this is quite a different situation from all the other new amendments which the government have been tabling during the course of this bill <e> <s> the concern of your lordships house was that a bill presented to your lordships house at second reading one would have thought reflected the governments opinion in a fairly advanced stage of what should be in the bill <e> <s> no sooner have we had second reading than we have pages of amendments being tabled to the bill <e> <s> subsequently we learn this afternoon that other vast new amendments are to be tabled to the bill <e> <s> the government should have crystallised their views on this situation before the bill came to second reading in your lordships house <e> <s> with regard to these amendments this is quite a different situation because the government are reacting to a view of your lordships committee which maybe they could not have anticipated in advance <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say that from our point of view we accept that whatever be the decision on this amendment it will follow on in relation to amendments nos <e> <s> and and later amendments <e> <s> however i must say that i think the government are very unwise to reintroduce this amendment at this time <e>", "<cs> my lords we have accepted that the debate on this amendment is a debate on the whole principle of the retention of the registry of business names <e> <s> as i understand it and i speak as a relative new boy to this house it is a convention of your lordships house that the same amendment or virtually the same amendment is not introduced in the house at report stage when it has been decided by noble lords and in this case by a vote of all your lordships at committee stage <e> <s> it would appear to me that the government are ignoring that convention <e> <s> i accept that the government would wish to seek to reverse the decision of your lordships at some later stage in the progress of the bill <e> <s> i believe that the government have been badly advised to seek to do this in this house because inevitably they will be faced with a further problem on this amendment when the bill goes to another place <e> <s> indeed as i see it the effect of their seeking a further vote from your lordships on this particular amendment is to waste further government time <e> <s> i had thought that the intention of the government was to seek to get their programme through as quickly as possible and not to waste time <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may revert to the question of the principle of the registry of business names the noble lord lord trefgarne has given the government view as to why they believe the registry should be abolished <e> <s> the fact is and i am in danger of repeating what i said on committee that without the registry of business names there will be no central register of unincorporated businesses there will be no access to information about a business other than from the business itself and objective information is vital to trade creditors to protect them from the risk of dealing on open credit terms with businesses that they know nothing about <e> <s> as we said at committee stage abolition of the registry is unnecessary because it can easily become self-financing <e> <s> there are many indications and we had some debate about this in committee that if the search fee were increased from p to and if the registration fee were increased from to or it would bring the registry into a solvent position <e> <s> therefore from the point of view of the cost of the running of the registry that side of the problen could easily be solved by the government being prepared to increase the fees which are charged <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i say this <e> <s> i know that the compliance levels have improved from conversations with a former minister at the department because procedures instituted by the previous government have increased the level of compliance <e>", "<cs> my lords one would have an annual registration fee which would pay for that <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not object to this amendment today it is consequential upon the passing of an earlier amendment today by your lordships house without any commitment that we may not wish to return to this again at a later stage <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble earl said in introducing the bill this bill has four objectives to separate the post office into british telecom and the post office as a separate entity secondly to give the secretary of state power to introduce the sweeping changes the government wish to see to the telecommunications monopoly thirdly to introduce parallel powers to reduce the post office monopoly and a new power to suspend that monopoly at any time he wishes and finally to give the treasury power to sell shares in cable and wireless <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may make just one brief comment on the remarks of the noble lord opposite i thought that in raising the objections which he did to the amendment set down in my noble friends name and in my own name he in fact himself made a very good case for the establishment of a central registry of some sort and i found him a very powerful advocate in that cause <e> <s> of course this amendment is not concerned with the establishment of a central registry but with the establishment of a local registry <e> <s> but what i would hope is that the government would realise the very great concern by the business community as a whole that there should be some form of registry <e> <s> we have accepted as has been made clear by my noble friend lord mishcon that the old registry of business names under the act is quite dead <e> <s> we accept that situation but i think there should be some form of registry <e> <s> i would hope that the house would look with favour on the amendment which my noble friend lord mishcon has moved as it attempts to establish the principle of some form of registry <e>", "<cs> my lords in moving that this bill do now pass the noble lord said that he thought it was a better bill than when it entered your lordships house <e> <s> it is certainly a larger bill than when it entered your lordships house <e> <s> i think that our initial debate at the beginning of the third reading today showed one of the reasons for the dissatisfaction of the house at the way this bill has proceeded through the house <e> <s> the bill which your lordships have before you today is a bill of pages with clauses <e> <s> when it was brought before the house at second reading it had only pages and clauses <e> <s> it has increased by per cent <e> <s> during its passage through this house <e> <s> there have been new clauses added to the bill since the second reading <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl for his remarks and i am glad to know of his general support for forms of collective agreements within british telecom <e> <s> this amendment was tabled specifically to ensure that the door was not closed to industrial democracy at main board level and to have that written into the bill <e> <s> i shall read with great care the remarks which the noble earl made in response <e>", "<cs> may i thank the noble earl for his response to my amendment <e> <s> i was particularly pleased to have the assurances he gave at the end of his remarks and i will read in detail his particular remarks in response to this amendment <e> <s> in the meantine i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i take exactly the opposite view from that of the noble lord lord orr-ewing and in fact find myself very much in agreement with the remarks made previously by the noble earl lord de la warr <e> <s> i think that it is quite essential that british telecom should have the means of carrying out end-to-end testing of telephone lines in the interests <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> to sum up i think one can say that the prime instrument policy as envisaged in the bill would be strongly in the customers interests in terms of cost service and practicability <e> <s> the noble earl lord de la warr also very properly referred to the disadvantages which would fall to british industry if in fact the prime instrument policy was to be abandoned <e> <s> the vast majority of telephone instruments which are available other than those from british telecom are of foreign manufacture and it is likely that to abandon the prime instrument policy would result in a large share of the new market going to overseas manufacturers with a consequent loss of jobs for british industry and an increase in imports <e> <s> therefore this prime instrument policy also protects the overall national interest <e>", "<cs> in responding to this debate the noble earl has taken much the same line as his honourable friend the minister of state took in another place but in the earlier part of his speech did admit that there was a problem here <e> <s> he went on to point out as i did in moving the amendment that there were indeed loopholes in the amendment <e> <s> i asked the noble earl for an undertaking that he would look at the problem to see whether he was able to come back on report with an amendment which covered this issue <e> <s> his view which your lordships have heard is that in fact no amendment is necessary <e> <s> the view which we take on advice is that in fact an amendment is necessary <e> <s> in that case i should like to press the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to argue this evening the question of cash limits <e> <s> as i said earlier i know that there are specific amendments relating to this later in the committee stage <e> <s> i think i must be quite frank that what we are concerned about here is that knowing the complexion of the present government and of their propensity to sell off national assets whenever they see some potential commercial advantage in doing so they take that course of action <e>", "<cs> of course british telecom has enormous assets and what immediately comes to mind is that prestel could be formed into a subsidiary company and sold off but there are many others <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble earl for his reply <e> <s> i was interested in what he said in response to my moving of this particular amendment <e> <s> i intend to study his reply in detail and possibly come back to it on report <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it must be of concern to all noble lords that the derbyshire a modern ship built in by a well-known firm of shipbuilders swan hunter should disappear without any trace in the pacific with the loss of lives <e> <s> this ship was equipped with all modern navigational aids magnetic compass gyrocompass automatic pilot radar echo sounder speed log and satellite navigator <e> <s> it had according to the investigations which have been made complied with all standards that are laid down and yet the disaster occurred <e> <s> this contains a lesson for us in that we have to be continually vigilant and continually ensure that those safety requirements are being updated all the time <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to thank the noble earl lord cranbrook for introducing this report and indeed for chairing the committee which produced the report <e> <s> in his introduction the noble earl highlighted many of the points which i would have wished to bring to your lordships attention this evening and indeed i have no intention of wearying your lordships at this hour which i suppose is a relatively early hour compared with some of the hours to which your lordships have been sitting recently by repeating the points which he made <e> <s> other points which i had thought of raising this evening were drawn to your lordships attention by the noble earl lord gosford <e>", "<cs> my lords battersea is in the borough of wandsworth and i apologise if i have lumped the whole of the southern area in the word lambeth <e> <s> of course concern was expressed by the tuc to the committee and this is the only point that i had underlined which was not mentioned by other noble lords <e> <s> the tuc was very concerned about the proposals and particularly the proposals in relation to blue asbestos <e> <s> it thinks that if the importation of blue asbestos is allowed even though it be in the form of manufactured goods pipes and so on it would be a retrograde step and should be resisted <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl used the words blue asbestos it would be simpler <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> of course the purpose of our amendment was to restrict the secretary of states powers in relation to the proposals in the beesley report because we are very concerned about a number of the proposals there <e> <s> it was our desire in moving this amendment to limit the potential area of damage <e> <s> i do not intend to press this amendment to a division this evening <e> <s> i shall read what the noble lord said in reply to this debate and also what his noble friend lord gowrie said in reply to the previous debate because to some extent they both touch on the beesley report and decide whether to come back to this whole issue at report stage <e>", "<cs> this certainly clarifies which subsection is referred to <e>", "<cs> the amendment would have the effect of giving the secretary of state a guideline when deciding whether to grant a licence <e> <s> as the minister said the secretary of state is bound to consult the corporation <e> <s> he is not however bound to take the views of the corporation into account before granting a licence so we felt it was necessary to include <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl for his response to my amendment <e> <s> i shall look carefully at his reply to this amendment and at his response to the earlier debate and will possibly come back to this at report stage <e>", "<cs> i have not personally consulted the members of the fund or indeed each and every one <e> <s> but i am informed that the members of the fund believe because of the views of the trustees that if additional expenses were incurred that would <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl the minister for his sympathetic response to this amendment <e> <s> i accept his point that there must be some solution to this particular problem but when he referred to the problem of disagreement among the trustees i believe he really meant that there could be problems if there were a disagreement between the secretary of state and the trustees rather than it being a case of the trustees disagreeing among themselves <e> <s> the noble earl the minister repeated the assurance which was given by the minister of state in another place that no member of the fund would lose any entitlement or suffer any decrease in his pension as a result of a splitting of the fund <e> <s> my concern is that if one effect of the splitting of the fund is that there will be additional costs placed upon the fund then at some time or another that is bound to have some effect on those who are members of the fund <e> <s> while accepting the noble earl the ministers major thesis this other point still remains <e> <s> however i shall look very carefully at what the noble earl the minister has said in response to this amendment and shall possibly come back to it at report stage <e>", "<cs> no doubt the noble lord will explain to us the purpose of this amendment <e>", "<cs> we appreciate the new power that is being given under the subsection and we appreciate too the reasons for it which the noble lord lord trefgarne enumerated in his reply <e> <s> they were very similar to the reasons that i gave as to why the new powers were being granted under the clause <e> <s> however i still feel that the powers could be exercised in an illogical way <e> <s> i accept many of the ministers arguments but i feel that this is a matter that i shall want to look into further and return to on report <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not think that it would be fruitful to take to a division a matter which has already been decided <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl for his response to my amendment <e> <s> i shall read closely what he has said in <e>", "<cs> as i indicated when i moved this amendment i do not at this stage intend to press it to a division but i shall take another look at the whole structure of clause after it has incorporated the various amendments which are being moved <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i find that reply by the noble lord not at all satisfactory <e> <s> i have in mind that what is not provided for in any way in his reply is how somebody who receives a communication a christmas card shall we say which is grossly delayed in its delivery is to know to whom to complain <e> <s> one part of my amendment would have made it easy for such a complaint to be lodged <e> <s> the noble lord might be able to be more helpful to your lordships if he could indicate what sort of conditions would attach to the granting of a licence <e> <s> would there be some of the sorts of conditions which i think i indicated should be attached to the granting of a licence in the series of amendments which i moved <e>", "<cs> i am not thinking about anything so extravagant as the noble lord suggested such as a legal action about the late receipt of a christmas card <e> <s> surely the point here is that there may be a number of charities who involve themselves in shall we say <e> <s> the delivery of christmas cards and as somebody who receives christmas cards unfranked with no identification falling continuously through ones letter box in the pre-christmas and also the post-christmas period one will be very interested to know in fact what sort of service is being given by the various organisations and charities who are doing this and who in fact they are <e> <s> i really cannot see the problem of identification marks being put by the carrier on to the particular class of mail which is being delivered <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord trefgarne is always very helpful to your lordships and indeed i am mindful that in earlier debates on other legislation this year there were matters which were not suitable for primary legislation and he was able to help your lordships considerably by placing in the library certain details and what particularly comes to mind is the articles of association of companies which it was proposed to set up <e> <s> so your lordships were able to see what the noble lord and his department had in mind in regard to particular items of legislation <e> <s> i think it would be very useful to your lordships if the noble lord could place in the library before report stage the sort of conditions which would attach to the issuing of a licence <e>", "<cs> in view of the noble lords remarks and his promise to be as helpful as he can in letting your lordships know by one means or another the sort of conditions he would envisage attaching to the licence i do not intend to press this amendment this evening <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl lord gowrie for introducing and explaining the technicalities of the iron and steel bill and also for explaining the governments intentions about the bill <e> <s> we welcome the financial provisions of this bill but we have strong reservations about the disposal of public assets that could become a possibility under the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords we welcome the proposals to write off the investment itself but what troubles me is the plants concerned being allowed to fall into disuse so that if they were subsequently needed they would not be available <e>", "<cs> this is perhaps not the most important bill we are discussing this session but it is of great importance to many groups of people we have heard reference to womens institutes boy scouts and girl guides and there are co-operative womens guilds and many other organisations which depend for much of their vitality and livelihood on being able to produce food in their own homes for sale at sales of work jumble sales and so on and the intention of the bill has the wholehearted support of the opposition <e> <s> my only concern is whether if the amendment were made we feel it is a worthy amendment it would in any way impede the ultimate progress of the measure on to the statute book <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that there obviously will be concern that work on the second terminal at gatwick should proceed quickly once a decision has been taken <e> <s> one would hope that the noble earl would be able to advise the house if it would be possible for a decision to be available before the summer recess <e>", "<cs> my lords the implications of this amendment as the noble earl said in moving it are that local weights and measures authorities are to be the enforcement authority for clauses and in respect of all apparatus whether marked or unmarked <e> <s> this implies the purchase and testing of equipment and the undertaking of prosecutions all of <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble earl for his explanation and for his indication of how he would see the secretary of state using his powers <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> order <e>", "<cs> i think it is by leave probably my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has explained very fully this package of amendments <e> <s> this makes it unnecessary for me to make the speech which i was going to make on my amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> that amendment was tabled specifically for the purpose of finding out what is the present state of the governments thinking with regard to the splitting of the fund <e> <s> i am glad to know that the government are still maintaining a very flexible attitude and that they intend to move with the fullest support and co-operation of all those involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the tabling of these amendments and i am only sorry that the government have not been able to see fit to extend the range of counter services which the post office could provide to the private sector as well as to the nationalised sector <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord has not felt able to accept the spirit of these amendments <e> <s> he is quite right that a person who receives a communication late can ask the sender to whom he entrusted it <e> <s> but it is not always easy to get in touch with the sender who may not be on the telephone or who may have moved away <e> <s> there are various problems one can think of in getting in touch with the sender in order to complain <e> <s> i have some comfort from the noble lords reply when he indicated that these could be conditions which are imposed when the licences are granted <e> <s> i confess that despite the arguments he used i fail to see how these minor suggestions would not be applicable in all cases <e> <s> nevertheless it is not my intention to divide the house on this issue <e> <s> i shall look once again very carefully at what the noble lord has said to see whether there is any further progress which we might be able to make on this <e> <s> it was my intention to move amendment no <e> <s> c and the noble lord seemed to indicate that would be accepted if i did so <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i find that a very odd argument because in fact included in clause are the words in writing <e> <s> they are there in the bill and therefore i should have thought that for the sake of consistency if it is the intention that licences in either case should be issued in writing there is really no reason why the government should not accept this very minor amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not wish to add anything further to what he has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i find the argument rather difficult to follow <e> <s> i certainly would not press this amendment to a division but i shall smile if the government themselves come back with their nd amendment on third reading adding the words in writing i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i did not expect for one minute that the amendment would be successful because as the noble earl lord gowrie says it strikes at the very heart of the bill and we as noble lords will know do not agree with the ideology of privatisation <e> <s> i was surprised that the noble lord lord rochester said that he would never have nationalised the steel industry in the first place <e> <s> i always felt that despite any ideological arguments there might have been about the nationalisation of the steel industry in the s there was very good industrial logic for it to take place at that time because the areas of operation of individual steel companies were far too small to make industrial sense <e> <s> i do not think any noble lord has maintained that if you had kept the steel industry in private hands it would have done any better than british steel has done <e> <s> that argument is not an argument which i have heard used <e> <s> i do not intend to withdraw this amendment but on the other hand i do not intend to press it to a division <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble earl for his response to this particular amendment <e> <s> once again i was not in any way surprised by anything that he said <e> <s> our view is that the present section of the act should stand as it is unamended <e> <s> we feel that these specific amendments to the act have been tabled for ideological reasons and we object to them <e> <s> i do not intend to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to comment briefly on why we believe that clause <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl for his reply which again does not surprise me <e> <s> it is not my intention to press this particular matter to a division <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down i should like to echo the remarks of the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran about the warm response that the noble earl gave to many of the amendments moved on this bill <e> <s> but i should like to point out that of the amendments tabled were tabled by himself <e> <s> all of these were accepted but not one of the amendments tabled by the opposition many of a constructive nature received any constructive response at all <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble viscount for explaining this order and for the detail of his explanation <e> <s> i note as he said that both this order and the subsequent order have been considered by the joint committee in their th report and that they have found that the element of retrospection in the order is such that the interests of the redundant shipyard workers are fully protected by these orders <e> <s> so far as we are concerned we welcome the laying of the orders and hope that the house approves them <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first of all join with other noble lords in thanking the noble baroness lady burton for asking this question and yet again express admiration as many noble lords have already done about her persistence in raising this issue <e> <s> her case was so persuasive when she spoke that it is difficult to know what can be said in addition to what she has already said <e> <s> i am sure that your lordships primary concern must be that the consumer interest of air travellers is catered for in that they all have the ability of being carried as cheaply and as safely as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the chief whip is quite right in thinking that we have reached the point in our consideration of this bill at which it would be appropriate to terminate our proceedings <e> <s> i am sorry that we have not got as far as the noble lord had hoped but we have endeavoured to move as quickly as possible this evening <e> <s> there are a number of intricate and difficult points which your lordships have had to consider <e> <s> i am sure that it was right and proper that we should have taken the time necessary to consider the various amendments which have been before us this evening <e> <s> i am certain that when we resume the report stage of these proceedings on the transport bill next week we shall endeavour to make sufficient progress so that we shall be able to complete the report stage of the bill then <e> <s> i entirely agree with the noble lord the chief whip that this would be an appropriate time to adjourn the proceedings this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord lyell for explaining this order <e> <s> may i say on behalf of the opposition that we welcome the laying of this order and that i was glad to learn that it has been considered by the joint committee on statutory instruments <e> <s> as the noble lord said our relationship with yugoslavia is a unique one <e> <s> to demonstrate its uniqueness i noted that the preamble to the co-operation agreement states that the agreement is between the community and its member states on the one hand and the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia a non-aligned european mediterranean state and a member of the group of developing countries on the other hand <e> <s> this shows the uniqueness of yugoslavia <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first of all thank the noble lord for repeating the statement made in the other place detailing the governments reaction to the mmc report that is the monopolies and mergers commission report published almost a year ago today and based on evidence taken in <e> <s> this is an appalling statement <e> <s> it flies right in the face of the expressed wishes of the national consumer council the manufacturers the gas industry and the gas consumer council <e> <s> the only part of the industry which i understand is in favour of this statement is the retailers <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i was seeking to intervene a few moments ago when the noble lord lord trefgarne was replying to my noble friend lord noel-baker when he referred to the monopoly situation revealed in the mmc report <e> <s> what i wanted to draw to his attention was that this report was based on the retailing position in the industry in five years ago and since that time there have been considerable additional outlets for gas appliances outside the showrooms of the board <e> <s> the other point which the noble lord took me up on regarding safety and its being times more likely for there to be an accident if an installation is made by a non-employee of the gas board i would agree with the noble lord that i should have referred to a non-gas board employee as opposed specifically to somebody working for a corgi firm <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord for repeating the statement and informing the house that the secretary of state has completed the consultations concerning the proposed transfer of <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord for moving the regulations so expeditiously <e> <s> i have had an opportunity of reading the details of the proposals which he was kind enough to send me in advance today and indeed am able to express my gratification that the price of something has actually come down <e> <s> although as the noble lord explained the reason for this was that the previous increase was partially brought about by the need to pay off the deficit it is nevertheless gratifying that this should happen <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord blease who is unfortunately unable to be with us this evening i should like to thank the noble viscount for explaining this order <e> <s> we on this side of the house welcome the order in so far as it beings northern ireland into line with legislation in great britain for the payment of capital grants to private industries for the construction of industrial premises <e> <s> whatever may be the benefits in the long term to northern irelands industrial potential it would seem unlikely in the short term that this legislation will provide the kind of assistance which is urgently required to promote productive employment as unfortunately spare factory space is not all that scarce a commodity in northern ireland <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will be able to assure your lordships that development sites will be released by the appropriate authorities in new towns where land is nearly all vested in a public body <e> <s> perhaps the noble viscount would also be able to define for your lordships what he means by a qualifying industrial purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first of all thank the noble earl lord kinnoull for allowing us on this auspicious day although rather late in the evening the opportunity to discuss this report which unfortunately we were unable to discuss last week <e> <s> i should first of all like to associate myself with the condolences which he expressed to all those who were bereaved as a result of this appalling accident <e> <s> secondly <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord for making that announcement <e> <s> i hope that the effect of it will be that we shall get home half an hour earlier on thursday <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord lyell for so fully explaining the purpose of this particular order <e> <s> as the noble lord said there is a considerable division of opinion within the industry as to whether the action <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord leaves the question of the eady levy could he say if he has the figures to hand how much that levy is producing for the film industry now as compared with say years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for his good wishes for the recess and certainly i wish to associate those of us on this side of the house with his wish that the staff shall have a restful recess <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble earl for repeating the statement made by the secretary of state in another place <e> <s> i must confess that i found the statement a very ungracious statement bearing in mind the fact that the secretary of state has been found guilty of unlawful conduct in a court of law <e> <s> i should have thought that in the circumstances he would have come to the house with a very different statement from the one which the noble earl has just repeated to us <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for explaining the amendment in detail and for bringing it forward <e> <s> we regard this as an improvement to the bill as it meets some of the fears expressed in committee and on report particularly by my noble friend lord mishcon post-registration change of name instead of pre-registration change of name provides an element of protection <e> <s> while having welcomed this proposal we would on the whole have felt it better had the government stuck to the present system which allows subjective assessment of an individual name to be made on registration <e> <s> nevertheless we regard the amendment as an improvement to the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords we welcome this particular amendment <e> <s> as the noble lord said it meets a number of the criticisms that were made in your lordships house in particular by my noble friend lord mishcon and it will indeed help the consumer in being able to trace any defaulting business <e>", "<cs> my lords the enforcement of the control of the use of business names is the subject of this amendment and in a sense it is self-evident that there needed to be an enforcement procedure <e> <s> however following the doing away with the registry of business names and the consequential saving of staff in the light of the introduction of this new clause involving the necessary enforcement of the two previous clauses one must ask how many people will be involved in the enforcement procedure <e> <s> it could well be that the enforcement procedure will reflect on the strength not of the civil service but perhaps the local authorities <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble and learned lord can give your lordships any idea of the number of additional staff which the enforcement procedure will involve and say whether there is any net saving at all in staff <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell your lordships what in fact will now happen to the records <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> a as an amendment to commons amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> a as an amendment to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord for that explanation and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for repeating the statement <e> <s> we on this side on the house believe that the bbc should be financed by a proper licence fee to ensure its independence and maintenance of proper standards <e> <s> however we are also concerned that the licence fees should be raised and that proper provision should be made for those who find television indispensable to any enjoyment of life as indeed the minister recognises in his statement <e> <s> we are particularly concerned about the old and the disabled <e> <s> the increase of approximately per cent <e> <s> over a three-year period suggests that the government do not see inflation falling into single figures during the remainder of their period of office <e> <s> the increase will not reflect itself in the retail price index on which old-age pensions are based until next years increase <e> <s> so old-age pensioners will immediately find themselves in difficulty in finding the full amount of the new licence fee <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like as other noble lords have done to thank the noble earl lord gosford for raising this evening the subject of asbestos <e> <s> those who have spoken before me in the debate have gone into a great deal of detail <e> <s> i do not intend to weary your lordships by repeating it <e> <s> however it has presented your lordships with a very effective case for the government taking action <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that many overseas visitors to this country like to taste the exellent white wine made from english and welsh grapes but are put off doing so because the price of the wine is often considerably higher than the price of wine imported from europe <e> <s> is he able to do something about that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord lord trefgarne for introducing this bill in a very short -minute speech and i shall certainly try to make certain that in making my remarks i shall not exceed the pattern which he has set us this evening <e> <s> as the noble lord has said this is a very simple and non-controversial bill to increase the borrowing powers of british airways and the british airports authority and to enable consolidation of earlier civil aviation legislation to take place <e> <s> however it does give your lordships the opportunity to discuss at some length although in view of the lateness of the hour i hope it will not be at too great a length some of the problems which affect the civil aviation industry at the present time <e> <s> i have no doubt that some of the noble lords who are to speak in this debate will be raising matters which are of particular concern to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for introducing the bill and for finding himself able to cut the long speech which he had prepared <e> <s> i always thought it was a tradition of this house that when we had a dinner break those who were involved in the heavy business were let off for an hour <e> <s> but the noble lord appears to have landed the task of introducing this measure as well as being heavily committed on the previous matter which was before your lordships committee <e> <s> it would therefore be churlish of me at this time to speak at great length <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord would be happier if it was <e>", "<cs> the noble earl lord kinnoull is present <e>", "<cs> i support the noble earl lord kinnoull in his concern over the financing of the british airports authority <e> <s> i often feel that in second reading debates we are in danger of making committee stage remarks <e> <s> tonight it is probably the other way round we are possibly in danger of re-running the second reading debate in committee but i shall try to avoid doing that and avoid discussing <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to agree with a lot of the sentiments expressed by the noble lord lord balfour of inchrye <e> <s> we are concerned that this tragic demise of laker airways should not lead to a return of the high fares of the past <e> <s> i think that the question which this particularly poses is whether the government feel that they should be reconsidering their whole policy on the question of air routes and air traffic whether the lesson of laker is something which the government should learn in regard to their policies about control of air routes <e> <s> immediately one is concerned about the welfare of those passengers who may be stranded that all possible is being done to ensure that no individual passengers are unable to return home and that there are no losses so far as those who have booked potential flights <e>", "<cs> my lords my question is whether the government have any plans to review their policy in this area <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for introducing the regulations and for reminding your lordships of the purpose of the fund and its history <e> <s> the noble lord pointed quite rightly to the reduction in the costs of administering the funds and obviously your lordships will be pleased that these economies have been achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord answers that question and it is very much in line with what lord boyd-carpenter was saying i asked whether adequate notice could be given of any revision in the charges <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to the noble earls explanation of this amendment to my noble friend lord rosss response to that explanation and the noble earls response to that and in the circumstances i wish to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we have already agreed as the noble earl has said that section of the act be repealed <e> <s> it was of course a part of the civil aviation act which repealed this section of the act but of course this cannot come into effect until some portion of british airways is privatised <e> <s> since this privatisation may not take place for quite some time if ever this new amending bill has been brought forward this evening by the noble earl in order to ensure the repeal of section immediately <e>", "<cs> my lords i am under no misapprehension about this point <e> <s> i have been informed by the trade unions involved that this was the undertaking that was given at that meeting <e>", "<cs> before the next amendment is moved i wonder whether the government whip in charge can give the committee any indication of the time at which he proposes to adjourn the house this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords being neither a lawyer nor a scotsman it is with some trepidation that i rise in the absence owing to the speedy transaction of earlier business this afternoon of my noble friend lord elystan-morgan to respond to the moving of these regulations by the noble lord lord lyell <e> <s> i thank him for introducing and explaining the somewhat complex regulations to your lordships this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to speak in this debate following two former chairmen and one leader of the glc so i fear that perhaps in some ways the debate is becoming slightly incestuous <e> <s> in introducing this bill my noble friend lord underhill has highlighted the problems of london transport <e> <s> his bill of course enables us to restore to the glc the powers which we all thought it had prior to the law lords judgment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is fractional if it is broken down <e> <s> i should like to take the noble lords lord mottistone and lord tordoff off on another point <e> <s> i am afraid this is a hobbyhorse of mine <e> <s> they both raised the red herring about the tourists not paying sufficient tax and raised the question of a tourist tax <e> <s> one always feels compelled to remind people who raise this point that the tourist through the vat which he pays on his hotel bill and the vat which he may pay in other ways produces many millions of pounds of tax revenue each year for the government <e> <s> that should not be forgotten <e>", "<cs> however my lords the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead went on to say that it was of the utmost importance how people travelled around london and underlined the importance how people travelled around london and underlined the importance which i do not think was underlined by many other speakers of having an efficient and effective system of having a high quality of service <e> <s> the question of a high quality of service can go hand in hand with the other points we have mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank the noble earl for explaining to your lordships the purpose of the order <e> <s> it has been considered by the joint committee on statutory instruments and in its tenth report it feels that there is no particular matter in the order which should be drawn to your lordships attention <e> <s> therefore i am pleased to support the introduction of the order <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord lyell for explaining this complicated order in detail to your lordships <e> <s> again this order has been one approved by the joint committee on statutory instruments and there were no particular comments which the joint committee wished to draw to your lordships attention <e> <s> the order is of course a result of the coming into effect of the demise of the national freight corporation and is really consequential to that <e> <s> we on this side of the house were not in favour of the demise of the national freight corporation but we accept that this particular order is a consequence of that and as much we do not disagree with it <e>", "<cs> my lords in reciprocating the best wishes expressed by the chief whip that we shall all be able to enjoy to the full the recess until th april may i say that i hope the recess will be undisturbed by the need to recall parliament but if it is necessary i am sure the government will not hesitate to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister confirm in the first place that he is aware that the greater london council took legal opinion with regard to the establishment of the london enterprise board and that that legal opinion was favourable and secondly that the proposals in his own consultation document would in no way limit the proposals which the glc have made under section <e> <s> finally i wonder whether the minister is aware that the glc enjoys a good relationship with the london enterprise agency which is a sub-committee of the london chamber of commerce and that there is a very good relationship with private enterprise over this proposal <e>", "<cs> the noble earl has referred to this amendment as a wrecking amendment <e> <s> of course if the bill was passed into law as it now stands there is in fact no date set in the bill for the bill to come into operation <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for that advice <e> <s> however i must say that i consider the governments attitude on this particular bill devious <e> <s> the noble lord lord trefgarne has said that it is all right for the government to support <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank the noble lord lord beswick for initiating this debate this evening on the a airbus <e> <s> it is fair to say that nobody is better qualified than the noble lord to speak on this subject <e> <s> he has been ably supported by a number of noble lords including the noble earl lord amherst who speaks as one who first qualified as a commercial pilot over years ago <e> <s> therefore his experience must be particularly relevant to a debate such as this <e>", "<cs> my lords as did other noble lords may i start by thanking the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth for initiating the debate this afternoon <e> <s> indeed as was underlined by the noble lord lord renton who has just sat down the debate has been far more wide-ranging i am sure than the noble lord lord lucas would have guessed <e> <s> in fact we seem to have discussed a very wide range of subjects <e> <s> i was particularly impressed with the maiden speaker lord cayzer and should like to congratulate him <e> <s> he was pointing to the changes in the modes of transport which had taken place over the past few decades the switch from ship to air for long-distance travel and this of course has had very far-reaching effects on the whole economic fabric of many of the british seaside resorts and of resorts overseas <e> <s> so it has been a very important switch <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord mishcon in moving the second reading of this bill most eloquently told your lordships of its purpose <e> <s> i do not think it necessary for me to repeat what he said <e> <s> as the noble baroness lady seear said it is surprising that part i of the bill concerning the supply of goods should be necessary at all <e> <s> this bill has enjoyed widespread support from all sides of the house and from a multiplicity of organisations as has been mentioned the national consumer council the consumers association the scottish consumer council the welsh consumer council the national federation of consumer groups the citizens advice bureaux and the institute of trading standards administration <e> <s> it has now been blessed by the noble lord lord young of dartington who can be regarded as the father of the consumer movement <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for explaining this order <e> <s> i must say that in this case i have found the order itself singularly uninformative without any explanation at all attached to it other than a very brief one <e> <s> i am glad to know that this order has in fact been approved by the joint committee on statutory instruments but one wonders what regulations in fact apply if the hovercraft are operating in a non-marine environment <e> <s> do similar regulations apply or not <e> <s> one also wonders what steps are being taken to ensure that operators comply with the regulations now being laid before parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill is welcome in so far as it goes and is in itself non-controversial <e> <s> it increases the limit as the noble viscount has said of financial assistance to industry basically to take account of inflation <e> <s> that is something with which we do not have any dispute <e> <s> however that does not mean to say that we are satisfied that the proposals go far enough <e> <s> they go only a limited way towards giving the support and assistance and intervention which we believe is needed in certain sectors of industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord in giving his congratulations to exporters would couple with them congratulations to those responsible for invisible exports such as tourism and insurance <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for repeating the statement being made by the secretary of state in another place <e> <s> it is in part a welcome statement although not as welcome as if the minister had openly admitted that he was climbing down on two of the cardinal points included in his statement of december <e> <s> basically the statement for all its length says that the government will not now withdraw supplementary benefit from those -year-olds who will not take part and that the training allowance will be increased to per week that is the a year to which the minister referred in his statement instead of the a week previously proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord for explaining the draft order in such detail <e> <s> your lordships will very much have appreciated the fact that the noble lord was able to go into the amount of detail which he did in explaining the order <e> <s> the order itself is not contentious but its results could be highly contentious <e> <s> the noble lord explained in detail the problems which have arisen and which have made necessary the laying of this order but any scheme devised by the pilotage commission to induce a pilot to retire early is bound to create problems <e> <s> the noble lord himself underlined a number of the problems <e> <s> who in fact is to pay the inducement to persuade a pilot to retire early <e> <s> is it to be the shipowners <e> <s> is it to be the remaining pilots <e> <s> is it to be the government <e> <s> or is it perhaps to be the european economic community <e> <s> the shipowners are unlikely to be happy about paying this inducement as they will not derive any benefit from making this payment <e> <s> the pilots themselves will not wish to see their earnings eaten into by having <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord read the letter from the vicar of kensington in <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for repeating that statement entitled <e>", "<cs> before the next amendment is called it is now twenty past ten and i wonder whether the chief whip can give your lordships some indication as to how long he intends to keep your lordships here this evening <e>", "<cs> i think noble lords are seized of the need for us to complete the bill either on thursday or on thursday and friday <e> <s> i think noble lords present accept that point of view put forward by the chief whip and in the circumstances it would be right that the house should now be resumed <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord lord lyell for explaining what is a very detailed and complex piece of legislation <e> <s> it is inevitably a complex problem to regulate world shipping as it is to regulate world aviation <e> <s> i think it is interesting to note that in the field of aviation the government have fairly and squarely nailed their flag to the mast of deregulation though we have heard little about this since the effects of deregulation have shown up in the operations of a number of airlines <e> <s> it is therefore noteworthy that in the field of merchant shipping by bringing forward this bill for british accession to the un convention on a code of conduct for liner conferences the government are firmly nailing their flag to the mast of regulation <e> <s> indeed this will be the first time that liner conferences have been subject to any form of regulation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord earlier said that the damage was done years ago but he did not make it clear by whom in his opinion the damage had been done <e> <s> i take it he means that the damage was done as a result of the fact that the code was negotiated at that time by the united nations conference on trade and development that the damage was done by the negotiation of the code at that time which the labour administration of the day voted against <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord for explaining the intricacies of this particular order <e> <s> the statutory instruments committee have examined the order and they have made no comment on it <e> <s> it is necessary for this order to be laid as the noble lord has said in order to implement the united kingdoms obligation to the community to enable excise payments to be deferred on imported beer made-wine cider and matches <e> <s> i felt that this was rather an odd bunch of products <e> <s> beer i can understand and the noble lord has explained to us the situation with regard to beer imported from the community as opposed to beer which is made in the united kingdom <e> <s> i am wondering whether different regulations will apply with regard to the payment of duties for say beer imported from <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say just a few words to add to the expert remarks of my noble friend lord houghton of sowerby and i should first like to thank the noble lord for explaining the order <e> <s> in fact the noble lord lord houghton has commented on many of its facets <e> <s> i think i understand it correctly that in fact there is no intention of increasing the percentage of building society loans which may be made as special advances and therefore we are assured that the remaining percentage will be used by the building societies in their traditional role of making loans for house purchase <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble earl for explaining the regulations <e> <s> we do not oppose or wish to delay the implementation of these regulations <e> <s> indeed i should state that it is the earnest desire of the three local authority associations that these regulations come into force as soon as possible and the order states that they shall come into force on the day after they have been approved by both houses of parliament <e>", "<cs> but you have not tabled any amendments <e>", "<cs> this clause deals as we have heard with matters which may be provided for by regulations <e> <s> indeed i was pleased to hear the noble lord lord lyell confirm that the affirmative procedure will now be used for dealing with the regulations as and when they are made <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down what we shall in fact have therefore is a report every five years as to how the machinery has worked <e>", "<cs> my lords reverting to the noble lords earlier answer to the noble lord lord jenkins of putney i wonder whether he could indicate now when the government anticipate that they will be able to give their decision on the report of the public inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for repeating the statement and to say straight away that it is not a statement which we welcome nor is it welcomed in the industry <e> <s> the contents of the statement have been widely predicted in the press over the last few days and i am told that members of all the unions involved in the industry have already condemned the proposals which have been set out in the statement <e> <s> the statement pays tribute to the progress made by bt in transforming itself into a commercially oriented business and the last thing that it needs at present is a further period of uncertainty before it has fully adjusted itself to its current situation <e> <s> undoubtedly the morale and enthusiasm of management in the industry will suffer as a result of the proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord lord lyell for explaining this order <e> <s> may i also thank him for his courtesy in placing a copy of the memorandum of explanation in the library <e> <s> i am sure that all airline passengers will welcome the fact that the reduced levy is to be extended for a further seven months but one must ask why in fact this has occurred <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is no doubt aware that the parliamentary under-secretary mr sproat is currently carrying out an investigation into the question of the responsibilities of the individual statutory tourist boards <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for explaining these regulations <e> <s> i was glad to hear that in fact they include measures for the protection of the united kingdom film-making industry and to hear from the noble lord about the proposed new arrangements <e> <s> i think ones fear is that one of the effects of the new arrangements could be that the amount of levy which can be paid could be more thinly spread and of course is no indication that the amount of levy income might in fact be larger in the future <e> <s> one is aware that over a considerable period of years falling audiences in the cinemas have reduced in real terms the value of the levy collected despite increases in the amount of levy collected from time to time as a result of inflation <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord is satisfied that the income received from the levy is enough for the purposes which he has outlined <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the noble lord is going to speak on this or on his next motion <e>", "<cs> my lords the merchant shipping liner conferences bill has had a very easy passage through your lordships house <e> <s> it is an agreed measure and it has passed through your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for informing the house about the latest developments in the very serious dispute between the commission and the united states over steel imports <e> <s> although the noble lord has repeated many statements in this house i am told that this is the first time he has made a government statement as secretary of state <e> <s> as he will appreciate a statement made in this house comes on somewhat earlier than if it is a repeat statement made in another place and as a consequence i have only just seen the statement which he has made <e> <s> i would appreciate it if he could use his influence to get the procedures altered so that statements are received earlier so that there can be a proper response from the opposition <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he can clarify in a sense his statement today <e> <s> as i understand it and perhaps the noble lord will confirm this the cost is still being paid by the users searching will still be carried out centrally and the effect of his statement really is only that the method of payment by the users will be altered <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord for explaining the purpose of this order <e> <s> it was considered by the joint committee on statutory instruments which had no comment to offer <e> <s> the well maintained allowance is something which as the noble lord said was introduced some years ago and it remedied an ill at that time which arose in slum clearance schemes <e> <s> i am sure that the proposal that the multiplier should be increased is the correct one <e> <s> it is true that the well maintained allowance would have increased automatically when there was an increase in the rateable value and from time to time during the past years the amount of the rateable value will have been increased as various revaluations took place <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord could say how these two factors will affect the amount of the allowance <e> <s> also is this new multiplier now being introduced because the last revaluation of properties has not come forward as quickly as might have been expected <e> <s> my lords we support the order <e>", "<cs> my lords the point i was making was that if there was a revaluation of rateable values in an area and in the process the rateable values were brought up to date and doubled that would similarly have an effect on the well maintained allowance <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for making his statement and for exercising his discretion in favour of the united kingdoms trading interests by forbidding the companies concerned to comply with the american embargo <e> <s> in doing so the government have wisely followed the lead taken by the french government who have already openly ordered french companies to defy the american embargo and the italian government who have made clear their intention that the ban should be defied <e> <s> i hope that the west german government will follow the lead set by their other eec partners <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord the minister tell us how much of the billion was attributable to tourism <e>", "<cs> my lords to follow up this question from the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter is the noble lord aware that the duty free sales contribute something like million a year to keeping down fares both on aircraft and on ferries and that if they were abolished there would be a very substantial increase in fares <e> <s> the noble lord did assure the house that so far as brussels is concerned there is not too much danger that they will be abolished but can he also assure the house that there is no danger of the european court ruling that the concessions are not entirely within the rules of the european community <e>", "<cs> my lords am i not right in saying that as from st january next a state of confusion may exist in a place like terminal i at heathrow where passengers travelling from terminal to mexico will be able to buy duty-free american cigarettes although passengers travelling to brussels will have to pay a different price for the same goods <e>", "<cs> my lords my point is that travellers using the same terminal who are going to brussels will not have the benefit of the concessions with regard to goods which are manufactured in america like american cigarettes which will accrue to passengers to mexico who use the same terminal <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for explaining the details of the order <e> <s> we are glad to know that it has been approved by the joint committee on statutory instruments <e> <s> we are also glad <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with the noble lord in thanking the noble earl for repeating the holding statement made by the secretary of state in another place <e> <s> i am sure all noble lords hope that detailed proposals will result from the present discussions <e> <s> i think noble lords should remember that <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether in moving this motion the noble baroness is satisfied that sufficient time will be given to the very important debate on the hunt report on cable television <e> <s> i note that already lords have put down their names to speak in that debate and i am sure that by tuesday morning the number will be considerably greater than that <e>", "<cs> my lords i was under the impression that the unstarred question was put down for this wednesday <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord for making that business statement and for acquainting the house with the changed arrangements for tomorrow <e> <s> i am quite sure <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord lord lyell for explaining these very complex regulations in such a lucid way <e> <s> as the noble lord has said these regulations have been considered by the joint committee on statutory instruments which decided to draw the special attention of both houses to the above instrument on the ground that it makes unexpected use of the powers conferred by statute under which it is made <e> <s> of course in making that observation in fact the report of the joint committee is slightly complex to read the committee was specifically referring to the situation in which there is to be an effective rubber stamp of the qualifications of those who have served in particular areas in which they operate for a long period <e> <s> i shall be glad if the noble lord would confirm that this is a once-and-for-all application of those principles <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to thank the noble lord lord orr-ewing for putting down this motion today which has enabled your lordships to have an early opportunity to discuss this important report and for the debate to take place today on a motion without the time <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord nugent of guildford for giving us the opportunity to reopen the debate of rd november <e> <s> in opening this evenings debate he said that standards had continued to deteriorate since that time and he gave your lordships various examples <e> <s> indeed he quoted the number of four-letter words used in a certain programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the correction <e> <s> i think we must accept that although the previous debate was only two years ago there have been considerable changes since that time <e> <s> there have of course been changes in public values but there have also been changes in technology <e> <s> this was a point that we discussed at some length last week when we debated the hunt report on cable television <e> <s> i think that what your lordships found most hilarious on that occasion was the suggestion in the hunt report that there could be attached to a cable television set a special security device which would prevent children having access to the indecent channel <e> <s> each noble lord who mentioned that point in the debate was absolutely convinced that in the twinkling of an eye an intelligent -year-old could have worked out the solution to the particular unlocking device <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the question here really is not what is the public attitude to violence but whether it is right and to what extent violence should be shown on the television screen <e> <s> i think that the showing or viewing of violent episodes which have happened in northern ireland and in the lebanon in recent times brings home to people the full horror of these particular actions <e> <s> i also feel that make-believe violence is created and that many adolescents and one listens to some of these phone-in programmes regard violent programmes with a certain amount of hilarity because they realise that it is not for real <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord lord lyell for explaining this bill to your lordships in such detail <e> <s> the first comment i am led to make about this bill is that the title of the bill does not really reflect its contents <e> <s> as the noble lord informed your lordships the bill is mainly concerned with the licensing of pleasure craft between metres and metres in length boats which are judged to be of sufficient size to cross the channel and therefore may have to be able to confirm at the other side of the channel that they are properly licensed before they are able to enter the ports on the other side <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord lyell for explaining this order <e> <s> it was about months ago that he came to your lordships house and pleaded for an order to reduce the amount of the quota from to per cent <e> <s> i agree with his movement of this order today more in sorrow than in anger <e> <s> the fact that exhibitors have had continuing difficulty in achieving even the reduced quota of per cent <e> <s> and the fact that there have been no prosecutions since the previous order was laid underline the difficulty which exists because of the present state of the british film industry <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord leaves that point is he trying to anticipate the results of the review and will the review in fact produce the answers to the question the noble lord lord beaumont has asked <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise briefly to thank the noble lord lord lyell for explaining this order <e> <s> the noble lord did not appear to mention that the order had been considered by the joint committee on statutory instruments and in its fourth report had no comment to make on this particular order <e> <s> as the noble lord so eloquently explained the purpose of the order is to vary whether the members of a merger panel are regular or additional members <e> <s> it allows more flexibililty in the composition of the panel and reduces in total the number of members of the panel to five but it does not alter any principle relating to the consideration of <e>", "<cs> my lords in supporting the noble lord the chief whip i take this opportunity i hope not prematurely of congratulating him on achieving a more even flow of business at the start of this session <e> <s> as i said i hope those are not premature remarks and that we will in fact be spared having an intolerable programme of business next summer <e>", "<cs> i have pleasure in begging leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think that one could describe these two amendments as tidying up amendments and we certainly have no objection to them <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord informs your lordships that the number of telemessages has doubled what has doubled the number of overnight telegrams or the number of telegrams which arrive on the same day <e> <s> what figure has doubled <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord mean that all types of messages have doubled <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble viscount <e> <s> lord colville of culross for moving this prayer and for explaining the purpose of these regulations <e> <s> when one has an eminent lawyer explaining the purpose of the regulations and saying that they are not entirely straightforward and clear one is immediately filled with doubt as to whether in fact the regulations are as clearly drawn as they should <e>", "<cs> my lords first i join with other noble lords including the noble lord lord harris of high cross and the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords although the noble lord is undoubtedly right that the borough has technically acted within the spirit of the law is it not also true that by its precipitate action in knocking down half of kensington town hall it was in fact acting against the wishes of the local residents who they had been consulting about the redevelopment <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> may i thank the noble lord for repeating this extremely long and complicated statement <e> <s> the statement is in fact a statement of intent to move a series of amendments to the telecommunications bill which is currently going through its committee stage in another place <e> <s> i have no doubt that my honourable friends in another place will need to study the report before continuing with the committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord leaves that point i should like to ask how the subscriber is to determine which of the sections he is to call upon to look at his instrument <e> <s> it seems to me that we may be falling into the problem where two or three visits have to be made before a repair can be made <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join the noble lord lord greenway in welcoming the passage of this bill <e> <s> as the noble lord said on second reading we had certain misgivings about the operation of the bill <e> <s> we have discussed them assurances have been given and i think that those misgivings have been satisfied <e> <s> the bill will provide for simplified registration and that in a sense is necessary because of the passage of time and because of the new kinds of boats which need to be registered <e> <s> one hopes that the operation of the register at the particular ports in this country which will be fewer in number than in the past will be acceptable <e> <s> but all that i really wanted to do was to wish this bill well on its passage <e>", "<cs> my lords before we take the next business i wonder whether the noble lord lord denham can give an indication of when we shall return to the business of the transport bill <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may revert to the original answer that the noble lord lord lyell gave to his noble friend will he be prepared to put her suggestion to the english tourist board <e> <s> it need not be a cost to the english tourist boards funds if the award was in the shape of a plaque to be erected at the station concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be useful if one pointed out at this stage that the transport bill was brought forward from the commons on nd february and the bill of my noble friend lord molloy was ordered to be printed on th november <e> <s> it has been available for second reading as from a fortnight after th november <e> <s> i think one should also say that one knows that the government are determined to get the transport bill through without amendment <e> <s> therefore for my noble friend lord molloy to proceed with his bill at this stage is the only way that this matter can be properly considered <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl lord halsbury sits down i hope he will recall that this bill was introduced on th november last a few days after this session began <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble earl for so briefly moving this particular order <e> <s> i understand that one of the reasons why this particular order has been moved is to enable additional revenues to be generated at aldergrove airport which will enable the landing charges at that airport to be kept down and so to alleviate from increased charges those flying into aldergrove from such destinations as london birmingham edinburgh manchester glasgow and the isle of man <e> <s> but we all realise that those particular passengers on domestic routes will not themselves be customers in the duty-free areas and that the only customers in the duty-free areas will be those who are making international trips <e> <s> i understand that the amount of international traffic at aldergrove has substantially increased over the past few years and that this would include traffic to dublin <e>", "<cs> my lords did i understand the noble lord to say that we would not return to the report stage of the data protection bill before pm <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with other noble lords in thanking the select committee for their report and thanking the noble lord lord ferrier for bringing the report to the attention of the house <e> <s> all noble lords will be very much aware of the noble lords perseverance over many years in pursuing this matter in various different ways <e> <s> i know that he would like to see an obligation <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord lord lyell for explaining very lucidly these regulations <e> <s> i must say that his explanation of the regulations makes them much more understandable than the actual reading of the regulations themselves <e> <s> as the noble lord said these particular regulations have to be read in conjunction with the regulations <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord could advise your lordships whether there are any proposals to consolidate the two sets of regulations so that they can be read in a more digestible form than will be possible at present <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord for his remarks and concur with his sentiments <e> <s> the government have in fact given us a fairly hard lent term <e> <s> i think that we have sat on more days during this term than we have during similar periods for many years past <e> <s> i live in the hopes that when we come to the summer term we may be spared some of the very late nights and meeting on five days a week <e> <s> i hope indeed that the organisation of government business will be such that we shall have a more relaxed summer term than we have had in some recent years in the past <e> <s> of course i join wholeheartedly with the noble lord in his thanks and best wishes to the staff of the house <e> <s> i think that they and all of us deserve the slight respite only eight or nine days i think before we return on th april <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord for repeating the statement that is being made by the minister in another place <e> <s> it is a strange way for the government to say that they fully support the work of the citizens advice bureaux <e> <s> i would remind the noble lord who repeated the statement that it is the citizens advice bureaux and not the consumers advice bureaux <e> <s> if allegations are <e>", "<cs> my lords i was referring to the wild allegations made by the chairman of the beddington and wallington citizens advice bureaux <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that officials from the department of trade attend every meeting of the executive committee of the <e>", "<cs> my lords before we receive the report i wonder whether the government can give any indication of future business in view of the vote taken on the motion of the noble lord lord sandford earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for so promptly making that statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for explaining the purpose of the order <e> <s> in referring to the increased amount from to which would be protected under the acts the noble lord said that that was designed to take account of inflation <e> <s> i was surprised that he did not mention that since the previous limit was fixed the minimum <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to thank the noble lord lord trefgarne for explaining the purposes of this bill and for outlining its provisions <e> <s> as your lordships will readily recognise this bill is yet another of the governments unwelcome privatisation measures one which will not get on to the statute book if there is to be a general election in june and one which will not be implemented until after a general election and a government victory in that election <e> <s> indeed that event looks more and more unlikely the longer the election is postponed <e> <s> my hunch is that the government will play safe and go for a june election and a lot of your lordships work will have been in vain <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but my information is <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that it would not be open to the successor company to reduce the pension <e> <s> is he referring to pensions earned before the date of change or to pensions earned after the date when british telecom becomes a plc <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start as other noble lords have started by thanking the noble lord lord young of dartington for introducing this debate this evening <e> <s> indeed as has already been pointed out it is very appropriate that he should introduce this debate in view of the tremendous role which he has played in the growth of the consumer movement over the past years <e> <s> i should tell him that as a member myself of the consumers association almost since its foundation i feel that there is some point in filling up the annual ballot paper which is sent to me and that there are changes from time to time in the executive of the consumers association <e> <s> however i feel very much less enthusiastic about filling in my annual ballot form for the co-operative permanent building society now renamed the nationwide building society to which i have <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for repeating the statement on the white paper <e> <s> i am sure that your lordships would also wish as in another place to have an early and full debate on the contents of the white paper <e> <s> cable television is potentially of great benefit to the nation but it would seem that the governments proposals and their rush for implementation before an act is on the statute book meet more the needs of private profit and less the longer term needs of the nation as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the statement made by the noble lord and particularly the last sentence of that statement confirming the funding for any cab for the current year <e> <s> however the statement does not do anything to withdraw the allegations made about inappropriate political activity by the citizens advice bureaux and i wonder whether the government are now prepared to withdraw these allegations <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord lyell sits down i hope he will appreciate that i was referring to the inept handling of the situation by the government and not by him <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether or not i join with other noble lords in thanking the noble lord lord winstanley for leaving his unstarred question on the order paper this evening <e> <s> in fact i think that as the unstarred question has been set down the debate this evening has concentrated very much on the question of the citizens advice bureaux but the underlying question which i think lord winstanley wanted to draw out of the debate this evening concerned the reasons for the uncertainty about the allocation of the grant for to the national association of citizens advice bureaux <e> <s> i think the thought that he had in mind in altering the wording of his unstarred question was to highlight some of the problems by way of government grants to non-departmental public bodies or to voluntary-aided bodies which exist from time to time <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for confirming that what i have said is correct <e>", "<cs> in his reply to the debate on this amendment i think that the noble lord lord trefgarne pulled a certain amount of wool over noble lords eyes <e> <s> he set his face against any form of formal consultation <e> <s> he made some comments about the particular list set out in the amendment but he was not even prepared to concede any form of formal consultation on the appointment <e> <s> i have had considerable support for this amendment and i think it right that the feeling of the committee should be tested on it <e> <s> i would remind noble lords that we have even reached the situation today when the prime minister consults with the church about the appointment of the most reverend primate the archbishop of canterbury <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran in his amendment no <e> <s> and in the amendments which he mentioned as being in association with it <e> <s> this amendment effectively starts to put some flesh onto the structure of oftel <e> <s> the bill as it now stands creates an organisation with a head who has wide powers to direct the organisation <e> <s> inevitably there will be layers of staff beneath that particular head but as of now we have no concept what those layers will be or who will act in the absence of the director or what support he will have in terms of advice <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> is not covered by the present debate <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord beswick i should like to ask the question standing in his name on the order paper <e> <s> unfortunately my noble friend is unwell today <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the government have discussed the report with the members of the society of telecom executives <e> <s> the noble lord will know that this is an authoritative report which soberly sets out the case against privatisation <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord for so promptly making that statement and advising your lordships of the proposed business for the remainder of this week <e> <s> i assume that the intention will be that the house will meet on friday at oclock as previously arranged <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord lord lyell for explaining so succinctly the purposes of these two orders and for dealing with them together which i am sure is for the convenience of the house today <e> <s> i am glad to know that the joint committee have approved both these orders <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord could say with regard to the existing orders how many prosecutions have been made for contravention of the existing rules and what has been the level of success of those prosecutions <e> <s> at the same time can the noble lord lord lyell say whether prosecutions have been taken against foreign flag vessels and whether or not <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord for so promptly acquainting your lordships with this change of business for tomorrow and friday <e> <s> i wonder whether he could tell your lordships what are the three private members bills which may complete their commons stages tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister consider whether there is any merit in introducing some form of financial incentive to produce origin markings <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord moves for the last time in this parliament that the house do adjourn i should also like to hope that it will be for the last time may i join him in thanking all members of staff and all those who have supported the staff in this tiring session <e> <s> i hope that the next session will not be so tiring but i can give no promises of what form of legislation an incoming government might produce for the house <e> <s> indeed the new session might be even more tiring <e> <s> however we join the noble lord in his remarks concerning the support that we have received from the staff of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble earl lord kinnoull said we are indeed all very grateful to my noble friend lord beswick for raising this question today and for the context in which he has put it <e> <s> we also appreciate very much the knowledge which he brings to this short debate <e> <s> we are grateful also to the noble earl lord kinnoull who has added his support to the question <e> <s> one must be continually concerned about the foreign exchange implictions of a decision of the sort which british airways has to make shortly <e> <s> these days it is increasingly difficult to know whether a product is manufactured in the country where one thinks it is manufactured <e> <s> for example one can often buy a car with a british mark only to find that it has been made in germany or one can buy a television set with a japanese mark only to find that it has been made in britain <e> <s> so we need to look at the situation with regard to the airbus <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to return to the debate on the governments white paper on <e>", "<cs> my lords may i remind the noble lord that there is only one official opposition in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord lord lyell for explaining the purpose of this particular order <e> <s> it is an order of concern to the united kingdom as the main trading centre for jute <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord can tell your lordships what benefits to the united kingdom will flow from the establishment of this organisation <e> <s> perhaps he can also tell your lordships how many people in this country will benefit from the immunities and privileges conferred by this order <e> <s> your lordships will recall that earlier today when we were discussing quite another matter during questions considerable concern was expressed by a number of your lordships from different parts of the house about the extension of immunities and privileges to various persons of one sort of another <e>", "<cs> my lords may i again thank the noble lord lord lyell for a very full explanation of a complicated and potentially confusing matter <e> <s> it is a matter which is of great concern to the consumer and i fear that the confusion is likely to continue for a considerable period of time <e> <s> it seems to me that the consumer can either enter an imperial measure wine bar or a metric measure wine bar <e> <s> therefore he will be faced with four different amounts which he might receive in his glass of wine <e>", "<cs> my lords before the next business is taken i wonder whether the noble lord will indicate at what time we shall return to the business on the data protection bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for his usual very lucid explanation of a potentially complicated order <e> <s> it would seem that the main purpose of the order is to index-link the payments which have to be made by individual firms under it <e> <s> one queries why the index-linking is proposed and one wonders whether the government are thinking that there will be further inflation in the future and so want to save the annual laying of a new order <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord finally moves that the house do now adjourn may i associate those on these benches with the remarks which he has made in wishing all those who serve us in this house a restful time during the long recess <e> <s> we closely associate ourselves with the noble lords remarks <e> <s> as he has said we have had a relatively easy time since we came back here on nd june <e> <s> my only hope is that in planning the future business of your lordships house the government will ensure that at this time next july we shall not have <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a short debate and under the rules governing such debates it should end at and the noble viscount lord whitelaw should rise not later than <e> <s> so under those rules i have about an hour and minutes to speak <e> <s> but i can assure your lordships that it is not my intention to take up my full quota of time <e>", "<cs> my lords since the new system for tabling questions has been introduced can the noble viscount confirm that there has been a greater opportunity for peers to table questions at an earlier date than was previously so <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord for repeating the statement made by his right honourable friend in another place <e> <s> may i say first of all that the tourist industry will welcome the fact that the statement has been published <e> <s> the industry has been on tenterhooks to a greater or less extent since july when the former parliamentary under-secretary instituted this review and promised a statement within three months of the institution of the review <e> <s> in fact as your lordships will see it has taken almost months for the statement to see the light of day and the fact that it has been published will allay a great deal of uncertainty which has been felt in the industry and within the statutory boards during that period of time <e>", "<cs> my lords when we discussed this problem some years ago in the house the noble lord lord montagu of beaulieu the noble earl lord amherst and i moved an amendment which was accepted whereby each of the national boards had equal membership on the bta <e> <s> in that way the national boards controlled the overseas marketing of the bta <e> <s> i should have thought that that might be a more sensible solution than the one which the noble lord has suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords will the english tourist board have the power to sell england overseas <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank the noble lord lord soames for enabling us this evening again to discuss the question of televising the house <e> <s> i must say that i agree with many previous speakers that though we are not a democratically elected body and we are the secondary body of the legislature the public have a right to know what we are doing <e> <s> for very many years <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for explaining the order in such detail <e> <s> as he has said the order seeks to raise the notional weeks pay used to calculate redundancy unfair dismissal and insolvency payments from to a week which as he has said is an increase of approximately per cent <e> <s> and also to raise the daily limit for workers on short time or temporary lay off from to which is an increase of something slightly over per cent <e> <s> in arriving at these figures as the noble viscount said three factors have to be taken into account earnings the retail price index and certain other relevant factors to which the noble viscount referred <e> <s> yet as the noble viscount said during the period under review earnings moved up by almost per cent <e> <s> and the retail price index has moved up by per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble viscount finally sits down perhaps he could confirm the figure i gave him that if this weekly figure had been up rated in line with inflation and in line with earnings it would now be and not <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for explaining this order <e> <s> the order imposes a per cent <e> <s> payroll levy on construction employers in order to finance the work of the construction industry training board <e> <s> this order is to be welcomed as it provides the only way of providing training in a substantial industry of some million employees which is now in the midst of a recession <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to associate my friends on this side of the house with the remarks of the chief whip <e> <s> we should certainly like to be associated with him in the christmas wishes he has extended to members of the house and in particular with those which he has

lord can say whether he attributes the increase in the number of overseas visitors from north america entirely to the fall in the value of the pound against the dollar <e>", "<cs> my lords there is the matter of the motor vehicles variation of speed limits regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords before we start the consideration of the regulations i wonder whether the noble lord the chief whip could give an indication that we will not re-commence the committee stage of the housing and building control bill before pm <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble viscount the leader of the house will accept that the real concern of noble lords is that debates whether they be short or long should be unduly broken up by statements being taken at irregular intervals during those debates <e> <s> i wonder whether when there are two or three statements as there are today it would be possible for the first and second statements to be delayed so that all three statements could be taken together

the chief whip for repeating the answer to the private notice question put in another place earlier today <e> <s> the vote yesterday was won on a fundamental issue of principle <e> <s> on an earlier occasion the leader of the house described a government majority of as being substantial <e> <s> on that basis i would submit that the vote yesterday was a massive defeat for the government <e>",

in fact i had expressed the view and i know that the view had been expressed by other parties that four days for the committee stage of this bill is inadequate and that there should be a fifth committee day for this particular bill <e>", "<cs> my lords reverting to the noble lords original question which suggested that the recent increase in hotel tariffs was greater than the increase in inflation is the noble lord the minister aware that for three-star hotels and hotels of a lesser category than that the increase is no higher than the rate of inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord not also aware that the average price of a new york hotel room in dollar terms is now very much higher than the average price of a london hotel room <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for so succinctly explaining the <e>", "<cs> london government my lords <e>", "<cs> i take it that the house will not continue with this particular business before oclock <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble viscount for his reply <e> <s> of course i accept a number of the things he has said <e> <s> the question of course is not the need to retire at but the availability of the pension at the age of <e> <s> however having said that and having placed this on the record i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord raises an interesting point <e> <s> indeed there was some complexity in the drafting of this amendment because it is an amendment to the parliamentary pensions act which amended the act and this clause in this bill is amending section of the act which amended section of the act <e> <s> in order for the noble lord to be able to make full sense of this he will have to get a copy of the parliamentary pensions act <e> <s> i hope that that gives him the explanation he wanted <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief because i know that your lordships have much other business to transact today <e> <s> as the noble lord lord tordoff said in moving his amendment this is not a party matter <e> <s> with that we entirely agree and i have no doubt that if the noble lord presses his amendment to a division noble lords will vote as they see fit on a free vote without the imposition of any whips <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with the deputy chief whip in the best wishes which he has extended to members of the house and in the thanks he has extended to the staff of the house <e> <s> particularly i should like to extend a vote of thanks to the staff of the refreshment department who have had to cope with a unique number of late <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we could easily get to no <e> <s> but beyond that we might be going past oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord leaves

winding up for the opposition i am faced with a certain difficulty <e> <s> our debate today is on the report of your lordships select committee on sound broadcasting and not on the principle as to whether or not it is right to televise the proceedings of your lordships house <e> <s> your lordships house on th december last took the decision in principle in favour of the televising of some of its proceedings for an experimental period <e> <s> the debate today is on whether or not the proposed arrangements for televising the proceedings of your lordships house are satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord and i am sure the house will thank him for that clear exposition on the question of the level of the lighting at the present time <e> <s> however as i was saying it is for noble lords to decide whether or not they find acceptable the level of lighting which we now see exhibited <e> <s> if they find that these lights are intolerable then no doubt they will vote against the experiment <e> <s> but if they find that they are tolerable and a way to the ultimate televising of parliament as a whole they will vote for the report <e>", "<cs> my lords before we take the next business perhaps the noble baroness could indicate that we would not return to the prosecution of offences bill before oclock <e>", "<cs> clause stand part <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the same figure <e>", "<cs> the amendment must first be moved it has not been moved yet <e>", "<cs> before the house resumes can the noble lord perhaps give an indication that we shall not return to this business before pm <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord is right to suggest and indeed it has been agreed that clauses to should be recommitted before the bill leaves this house <e> <s> for the good order of business i should have thought that it would be useful if the chief whip could give an undertaking that this recommitment of clauses to would take place before the report stage of the bill <e> <s> if this is postponed until after some of the bill has been considered on report it would seem that it would lead <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for advising your lordships so quickly of the proposed change of business for this wednesday <e> <s> i am sure that in the circumstances the decision to postpone the debate in the name of the noble lord lord home of the hirsel to the later date in april is the right decision <e> <s> it obviously leaves a problem as to what business the house is to discuss on wednesday <e> <s> i think that the proposed unstarred questions which are likely to be tabled for wednesday being tabled at such very short notice will mean that many noble lords will not have notice of the subjects to be discussed in those unstarred questions this may well mean that we shall not have as satisfactory a debate on the matters to be raised as might have been the case had they been discussed on another occasion <e>", "<cs> lest silence by this side of the committee be construed as dissent i should like to say that my noble friend lord mishcon had hoped to be present to deal with these amendments but unfortunately they came on slightly later than anticipated and therefore he is not here <e> <s> so far as we can see the proposals being put forward by the noble lord lord newall seem to be eminently sensible and have our support in so far as individual peers support them <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may join the noble lord the chief whip in wishing all members of the staff who serve this house so well a restful recess and couple with that as he did the wish that all other noble lords also enjoy a restful recess <e> <s> as the noble lord said we have our political differences <e> <s> however in wishing the government chief whip a restful and happy easter recess i hope that the fact that his noble friend and my noble kinsman lord mersey has with a little help from this side of the house inflicted the third defeat on the government in the course of this week will not cause him any loss of sleep during the recess <e> <s> we hope to continue with this winning streak when we return on th april for the local government bill <e>", "<cs> it is certainly a way round the particular difficulty which we face now <e> <s> i think it is most unsatisfactory in a sense to break the debate in the middle of an amendment <e> <s> my information is that it is likely that one or two more noble lords will wish to speak which would take us considerably past oclock so perhaps the suggestion of my noble friend lord melchett might be the answer without breaking the tradition of not breaking into an amendment <e>", "<cs> the position is that the noble lord lord chelwood has in fact only moved amendment no <e> <s> at the present time that the noble lord should withdraw amendment no <e> <s> now and when we start again on tuesday we should start by the noble lord moving amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i apologise for not being present <e> <s> i was in consultation with the government chief whip <e> <s> i understand that in our temporary absence we have reached amendment no <e> <s> and other

concerned about this and it wrote for clarification as it had some doubt <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may interrupt the noble lord for a minute <e> <s> he has not quoted the <e>", "<cs> my lords may the question first be put on the amendment in the name of my noble friend lord shackleton

pound-dollar relationship had more impact on the tourist figures <e> <s> we hope that the so-called cancellations may be only postponements of decisions to visit the united kingdom <e> <s> i think they are and that many americans may be visiting over a number of years and can easily postpone a visit and come next year <e>", "<cs> my lords although the question refers specifically to tourist coaches will the noble lord agree that part of the current problem is caused by the increase in deregulated commuter coaches coming in and going out at particular peak times <e> <s> will he also agree

place tomorrow and not today <e>", "<cs> my lords before the next amendment is taken i should like to ask the government chief whip a question in the light of what i asked earlier today <e> <s> what is his proposal concerning consideration of the remainder of the third reading and the debate that the bill do now pass <e> <s> it is now oclock and the house should rise at oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for making that statement <e> <s> i am quite certain that the decision must now be made as noble lords must be aware of the progress of business <e> <s> when we discussed this earlier my noble friend lord cledwyn pointed out that it was likely that two days would be needed for third reading and the debate on the motion that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> before we take the next amendment perhaps i may ask the noble viscount the government whip whether it is the intention of the secretary of state for trade and industry to make a statement to the house shortly after pm <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to associate myself warmly with the remarks of the noble lord the government chief whip <e> <s> indeed we from this side of the house join with him in giving best wishes for a restful recess to noble lords in other parts of the house <e> <s> in particular i thank the staff for their patience and perseverance during what has been a most difficult session <e> <s> it has been a session not without drama in some of the facilities afforded to your lordships <e> <s> i am sure that many of us do not wish to go through such a session again <e>", "<cs> my lords one would like to say that it is the end of a long hot summer but i am afraid that it has been far from hot <e> <s> it has been one of the wettest summers that we have had for many years <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say anything about the average expenditure of tourists last year compared with the year before and whether there was any notable change in the breakdown of the number of visitors from different geographical sectors <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the deputy speaker said that tellers for the contents had not been appointed <e> <s> it should have been tellers for the not-contents <e>", "<cs> my lords the white paper to which we refer stipulates that attendances at committees would count <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to intervene again but it was not in the last manifesto <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first thank the noble lord lord stoddart for putting down this unstarred question <e> <s> he admitted when he opened his remarks that he had put it down in a feeling of anger and i think that feeling of anger and concern was very widespread after the vast votes which we had earlier in the year in particular on the poll tax <e> <s> the question of the reputation of the house is a matter of concern to all noble lords <e> <s> i think that the reputation of the house suffered as a result of these particular occasions <e>", "<cs> no the noble lord is not right my lords <e> <s> it is abolition in its present form which means reform <e> <s> the house of lords is as has been said on many occasions this evening a revising chamber <e> <s> we respect the will of the elected house <e> <s> we do not seek to challenge it at second reading a dictum which was laid down in this house many years ago <e> <s> we retain the right to put proposals to the other place for amending legislation <e> <s> it is our considered view when we put those proposls as to what should be done <e>", "<cs> travel expenses unless he had attended on a certain number of occasions <e> <s> this was found to be quite unworkable at the end of the day because it cut out some of the people whom the noble lord lord campbell of alloway had in mind <e> <s> it is possible that when one considered those proposals again such problems would arise <e> <s> my noble friend has put his question today <e> <s> it merits consideration and we await with interest what the noble lord the government chief whip has to say <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord knows that if he makes such a remark i must interrupt him as always <e> <s> he is counting all the independent peers as being against him and that is patently not so <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the time should be five minutes past eight as indicated earlier by the government whip <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the leader of the house for explaining so clearly the formula which has been used to calculate these increases <e> <s> as those who have studied the written answer he gave in the <e>", "<cs> my lords on this sombre day i wish to echo everything the noble lord the government chief whip said and join him in sending best wishes to fellow members of the house for a happy christmas break <e> <s> i should like to join especially in his remarks about the staff in all parts of the house particularly those in the refreshment department who i understand will be working this evening as well as at lunchtime today <e> <s> we should like to thank them for everything they have done <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble earl can give some information as to when consideration will be resumed <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there is considerable concern among democratically elected local authorities about the extent to which their powers are bit by bit being transferred to government-appointed quangos <e>", "<cs> that was the last occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the government chief whip for making that statement <e> <s> if it is necessary to alter or vary the order <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by thanking the noble lord lord bancroft for his comprehensive and masterly introduction to this report <e> <s> indeed having heard his introduction i felt that there was little need to repeat some of the points that he made <e> <s> i should also like to add to his remarks and the remarks of others a tribute to those who have served as members of the joint committee <e> <s> i am told that your lordships members of the joint committee were particularly assiduous in their attendance at meetings and i am sure that that is a good thing <e> <s> i regret however that neither of my noble friends who served on the committee is able to be with us this afternoon due to ill health <e> <s> my noble friend lord strabolgi was particularly hoping to speak but has been advised by his doctors that he should stay at home <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is intervening in the ministers speech <e>", "<cs> my lords before the question is put i wonder whether the noble viscount the acting whip on the government front bench can indicate on how many more occasions he thinks we may have to go through this procedure <e> <s> the house will be interested to know whether he has any idea how long it may be or how many more times we may have to adjourn <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble viscount says that we shall not finish these proceedings until am would it not be wise to adjourn for a longer period <e>", "<cs> my lords i <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is quite in order to raise the question of the business of the house before the noble viscount lord long moves the motion <e> <s> i understand that he wishes to make a business statement which i am sure noble lords will be interested to hear <e>", "<cs> my lords i should hate to quarrel with the leader of the house at this early hour on thursday morning but it is my understanding that if the noble viscount the duty government whip moves a motion for an adjournment it will not be possible to receive the message <e> <s> the house will then have to resume to receive the message <e> <s> if the message arrives from the commons before the motion to adjourn the house is actually moved we can receive the message <e> <s> once the motion has been put to the house we cannot receive the message at that time <e> <s> therefore i was in a sense anticipating the business statement which i understood the duty whip was about to make concerning the progress as he saw it of the matter which we are about to have under consideration <e> <s> if i am wrong no doubt the leader of the house will correct me <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that it is possible for this motion to be withdrawn at a later stage <e> <s> the noble viscount may wish to withdraw the motion if a certain event which we all anticipate takes place <e> <s> it has been <e>", "<cs> my lords that is very helpful indeed <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord tordoff for advising me about these matters <e> <s> it is of course true too that the licensing amendment scotland bill committee stage will also be taken on that day <e> <s> surprisingly that has caused some degree of contention and i understand that a number of amendments have been put down <e> <s> the committee will no doubt give due consideration to those amendments and indeed i understand that some interesting propositions are to be put forward concerning methods of dealing with the problem of teenage drinkers in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with the noble lord the government chief whip in expressing our thanks to all those who serve the house in whatever capacity <e> <s> a special vote of thanks is due to those members of the staff of the house who because of where they live have had to sleep overnight in some part of the palace of westminster in what are perhaps not the most luxurious of conditions <e> <s> camping out in the cholmondeley room and elsewhere on occasion can be quite an adventure but that becomes distinctly uncomfortable when it is a weekly routine <e> <s> i think that we owe a special vote of thanks to those members of staff who have had to sleep here during that period <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord the government chief whip for the information about the statement <e> <s> the hour of pm is an extraordinary time to take a statement <e> <s> as noble lords will know house of lords statements are taken immediately after questions <e> <s> i am surprised that we are not taking the statement at this time <e> <s> i should like to commend the noble lord the government chief whip for insisting that the privileges of parliament be preserved and upheld and that the subsequent statement to be made at a political conference in blackpool will be a mere repetition of this statement <e>", "<cs> my lords this is i believe the first time that the noble lord lord strathclyde has spoken in the house in his substantive position as minister responsible for tourism <e> <s> therefore we welcome him in that role as opposed to the many other roles which he performs here <e> <s> i wish to know whether the government are committed to supporting fully all the projects being put forward as part of the european year of tourism <e>", "<cs> order <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl was replying to the debate for the government <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord referred to the responsibility for tourism which is fragmented among five government departments <e> <s> is he satisfied that this fragmented responsibility will produce the best results <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has stressed the importance of tourism to the economy <e> <s> is he aware that one of the aspects which tourists find most disagreeable about our cities is their dirtiness <e> <s> what are the government doing about that other than restricting the ability of local authorities to spend sufficient money to clean up our cities <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that many noble lords will be looking forward to next week when the christmas recess begins <e> <s> however i believe that some noble lords are already trying to make plans for the easter recess <e> <s> therefore i wonder whether the noble lord the government chief whip has anything to say on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> however does that mean that the easter recess will take place in the week before easter as opposed to the week after <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the leader of the house for explaining this order to us <e> <s> the government have again adopted the ingenious solution first used last year of applying as a flat rate increase the increase given to members of parliament and the increase in ministerial and other salaries <e> <s> that has a lot to commend it but it produces the quirky result that the highest paid minister receives the lowest percentage increase so the prime minister herself receives the lowest percentage increase of all <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble lord the leader of the house was not quite right <e> <s> the intention was to reach the end of part ii at the finish of business on monday and today to reach clause which ends the question of representation <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with others in thanking the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale for introducing this unstarred question this evening <e> <s> not a single noble lord who has spoken in the debate has disagreed with the general thesis of the unstarred question or with the noble and learned lords contention that little had happened since the renton committee reported in <e> <s> the noble and learned lord emphasised that nothing had been done since that time to stem the flow of legislation <e> <s> one is reminded of the adage that it is always much easier to make a long speech than a short and pithy one <e> <s> i think that is probably true also with regard to the writing of legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures available to me suggest that the increase in the total number of pages of legislation in the s compared with the s is of the order of per cent <e> <s> that is a very sizeable increase in the amount of legislation going through parliament in that -year period <e>", "<cs> in order to qualify the figures that i gave i point out that they did not include consolidation bills <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make a point before the noble and learned lord sits down <e> <s> he said that a great deal of the criticism made of particular bills was because people were not very keen on the bills themselves <e> <s> that does not explain the situation where the government themselves introduce very many amendments to their own bills <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble lord a business question <e> <s> he will be aware that the student loans bill is down for second reading today week <e> <s> i understand that that bill has not yet been received from another place <e> <s> i should therefore like to know how the government propose to comply with standing orders which stipulate a minimum interval of two weekends between the introduction of a bill or the date on which a bill is brought from the commons and the second reading <e> <s> how has that situation arisen <e> <s> it will cause great inconvenience to many noble lords if it is necessary to postpone the second reading of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord did not answer the second part of my question as to how the situation has arisen when another place finished with the bill last thursday evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we agreed to go to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it would only take a short time to get there and it might be a good idea to finish that tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that announcement about speaking times for the two short debates today <e> <s> however some noble lords are in a little confusion concerning the first debate <e> <s> the footnote to the speakers list shows that the noble lord lord trefgarne in replying to the debate will be allowed a certain amount of time whereas on the speakers list itself the name of the minister who is to reply to the debate is given as the noble viscount lord ullswater <e> <s> i wonder which is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords the speakers list does not quite say that <e>", "<cs> in the absence of my noble friend lord mishcon perhaps i may echo the words of the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> we are very grateful to the committee which considers consolidation measures <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking almost at the end of this unstarred question it is perhaps difficult to avoid repeating what has already been said but i shall try to do so in so far as is possible <e> <s> i should like first to thank the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes for introducing the debate and deciding that this was the subject she wished to discuss on this occasion <e> <s> as one who has long been involved with the work of the london tourist board it gives me particular pleasure that she should raise the subject this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord wishes i will say sterling price <e> <s> however the point is that that was more than just a booking fee which in a sense every visitor expects to be added to the price of his ticket <e> <s> a booking fee may be or even per cent <e> <s> but not several times the price of the original ticket <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very interesting question <e> <s> one often sees in <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for getting up again before the noble lord sits down <e>"]
